Waititi will narrate the story while dozens of actors join in, including Lupita Nyong’o, Mindy Kaling and Cate Blanchett. In the first episode, the Hemsworth brothers play Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, with Streep and Cumberbatch taking on the roles of the evil aunties in the second – probably the only time Streep and Chris Hemsworth will ever play the same character.The first and second episodes are both available to view now, with remaining instalments to be released on the Roald Dahl YouTube channel every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.The collaboration is intended to raise money for global health non-profit Partners in Health (PIH), which is fighting Covid-19 in the world’s most vulnerable areas. The Roald Dahl Story Company has committed matching donations up to $1m (£823,000), as part of a wider commitment to give more than £1m to charities affected by Covid-19, including the Roald Dahl Marvellous Children’s Charity in the UK, which provides specialist nurses to seriously ill children.Waititi said that James and the Giant Peach, in which James embarks on an adventure with various giant insectoid companions, was a “wacky, wonderful tale” about “resilience in children, triumph over adversity and dealing with a sense of isolation which couldn’t been more relevant today”. First published in 1961, the book has sold more than 28m copies around the world.“Being an adult child myself and having read James and the Giant Peach to my girls multiple times, I’m excited to be able to partner with my friends, the Dahl team and PIH and retell this story to help those most in need right now,” said Waititi, who is already writing, directing and executive producing two original Roald Dahl animated series for Netflix, one based on the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and one centred on the Oompa-Loompas.Dahl’s daughter, Ophelia Dahl, the founder of PIH, said her father had instilled in his children when they were young “the notion that imagination will spark a chain reaction of possibilities – we can dream endlessly about ideas and make them real”.“This early training meant it was not such a leap to envision PIH with my friends,” she said. “Roald was one of our earliest and most enthusiastic supporters and never let me leave for Haiti without stuffing a massive wad of cash in my hand to put towards the next project. You can see from his stories that he always supported the most vulnerable and those excluded from opportunity. PIH was the perfect match.” “We know from experience that the impact of this virus will be felt most by vulnerable communities around the world,” she added. “But with more than three decades’ experience in community-based health care, including responses to epidemics and outbreaks such as Ebola, cholera and tuberculosis, we know how to fight this.”The Roald Dahl Story Company previously donated $1.3m to PIH for maternal health in Sierra Leone, and has given $12m to date to other charitable causes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abed730917cece76362ab8a1bc7d627e42446683/0_0_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a3c0d5a282376c0b7fd605d4f1ffca","title":"share prices buoyed by lockdown easing and hopes of covid vaccine","story":"In one of the best performances since the crisis began, global stock markets rise sharplyShare prices have risen strongly on global stock markets amid an easing of lockdown restrictions, the announcement of a Franco-German rescue package for Europe and rising hopes of a vaccine for Covid-19.In one of its strongest trading days since the crisis began in March, the FTSE 100, which measures the stock market performance of the City’s leading companies, gained 248 points and ended the day at 6,048.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average opened strongly after Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts, reported encouraging results from early trials of a new vaccine.Edward Moya of Oanda said: “The start of the trading week was supposed to have some optimism with the global economic recovery, but no one anticipated this Monday’s start.“Risk appetite is running wild after Moderna’s experimental vaccine showed promising early signs to create an immune-system response might be able to fight off Covid-19. Global equities are roaring higher on vaccine hopes combined with continued major economies reopening and as the Fed continues to promise more stimulus is coming when it is needed.”The rise in stock markets came despite a warning from the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, that a full recovery was unlikely for the global economy in 2021.The IMF’s managing director told Reuters that data had been worse than expected, adding: “Obviously that means it will take us much longer to have a full recovery from this crisis.”With financial markets taking fright last week at growing trade tensions between the US and China, Georgieva also warned against countries resorting to protectionism.“We do need to keep trade flows open, especially for medical supplies, food and longer-term to find a pathway to overcome what is happening now with this crisis,” she said. “We want to continue to build this more prosperous future for all by overcoming the scarring that may come from this crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79b1bde606b807a803a9164236ff954813121165/0_1_5758_3455/master/5758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e1946cf500f9a4cca1c293b73009f2","title":"refunds rather than insults would serve ryanair boss well coronavirus","story":"Michael O’Leary’s rants won’t cut much ice with the EU or UK. A more constructive approach to the coronavirus crisis probably willMichael O’Leary has always been willing to conduct more than one fight at a time, but the Ryanair chief executive, who seems in danger of exploding with fury every time he speaks at the moment, may be well-advised to calm down and deploy smarter tactics.For starters, his outrage over “state-aid dopers”, as he calls Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and others, is unlikely to achieve much. Alitalia was being bailed out quietly by the Italian government even before Covid-19 arrived, so the chances of persuading the EU to jump on multiple instances of “illegal” state-aid are roughly zero.Ryanair’s own £600m loan via the Bank of England’s coronavirus lending facility falls into a different bracket, O’Leary argued, because the scheme is not sector-specific and is generally available to credit-worthy borrowers. That’s true, but don’t expect the distinction to cut much ice with EU regulators. However unfair it is, flag-carrying airlines have always been treated differently.O’Leary’s other rant about the “idiotic” nature of the UK government’s 14-day quarantine plan will enjoy some popular support among would-be holidaymakers, but the audience Ryanair would surely prefer to influence is government itself. Ministers, after all, will make the rules, not Ryanair.O’Leary may help himself by sounding more constructive. Here’s an idea: since “not sure” and “hope for the best” Covid cases could be most dangerous in spreading the virus in airports and on planes, Ryanair could offer a refund to any passenger, and member of their family, who feels even mildly ill in the days before a flight.No-quibble refunds are not Ryanair’s normal style, but an effort in that direction would show more seriousness than the current exercise in throwing insults.The beleaguered board of Intu, the over-borrowed owner of shopping centres, has thought long and hard (again) about how to resolve a £4.5bn debt nightmare and here’s its latest idea: boot the problem Intu the long grass.The “update on lender discussions” was really a proposal not to hold meaningful discussions for a while. The owner of the Trafford Centre near Manchester, the centre in Gateshead, Lakeside in Essex, and others is seeking a standstill arrangement that would allow it to operate on a “pay if you can” basis with lenders until the end of 2021.In other words, covenant tests on borrowings, which the company is at severe risk of failing in June, would be waived and everybody would pledge to revisit the mess another day.There is no guarantee all lenders will play ball, of course. Intu is a complex financial construction and has many flavours of lenders – everything from high street banks to hedge funds. But the board will probably get most of what it wants since it is impossible to round up buyers for large malls, as Hammerson proved when a sale of seven centres collapsed this month. Most lenders don’t want to take control of acres of retail space.Prepare, then, for another round of “extend and pretend”. It may make short-term sense at Intu, but a delayed restructuring adds another layer of uncertainty to valuations across the retail property sector. Nobody knows what anything is worth – and the answers are likely to take ages to arrive.An encouraging Covid vaccine trial by the US group Moderna pushed stock markets everywhere higher on Monday, but there was a medical breakthrough on a different front closer to home. GlaxoSmithKline said its trial to develop a two-monthly injection to prevent HIV infection has shown excellent results.The result seems to have been way beyond GSK’s expectations and could mean approval for cabotegravir in the US and Europe later this year. It is just one treatment and nothing can ever be taken for granted in drug development – but it’s another piece of evidence that the long-promised improvement in productivity in GSK’s labs may finally be happening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/268674c24c2292d7c484a0e40c226c8730a331be/210_0_7869_4724/master/7869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b54721208758d0d9e742cb993a50b01","title":"britain trust coronavirus government pandemic public","story":"No government could have been completely ready for the pandemic, but taking the public for fools has destroyed all trust Waves of panic radiate from the government. Each day ministers sent out to steady the ship in press conferences and broadcast studios tip it a bit closer to capsizing. Asking Michael Gove to soothe the teachers on Sunday with his, “Teachers will be safe in schools” line was about as reassuring to those he called “the blob” as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Child Catcher summoning children from their cellars. When there are differences of opinion between scientists on what counts as safe, only honesty about what is in doubt earns political trust. But daily, they blow their credibility away.Paralysis during their leader’s brush with death has given way since his return to alarm at their helmsman’s zigzag steering. His 13-minute address to the nation did more to hole the ship than buoy it in public opinion. No efforts were made to ease in his new back-to-work message. Without consulting teachers, care home managers, mayors or leaders of the other nations, of course he faced a backlash. Stay alert? It hasn’t exactly tripped off ministerial tongues since then.Boris Johnson swept to power on brilliant messaging, his spinners turning straw to electoral gold with “Take back control” and “Get Brexit done”, but all that’s gone. He likes to be liked, yet approval ratings are tumbling: Opinium polls showed a +42 net approval rating for his handling of the virus in March that has fallen to -3. YouGov’s +51 net approval rating on 27 March has plunged to -2. Keir Starmer’s personal rating overtook Johnson’s last week. The government was sent into a flat spin by Starmer’s trouncing of Johnson at prime minister’s questions over the appalling care home death rates.Fresh from a mega-victory and an age from the next election, why should the government panic? Because serial bungles, missteps, policy reversals and a vanishing connection with honesty risk damaging it beyond repair. No one knows all the right numbers yet, but trust shrinks when the government misuses them anyway. After Prof Tim Spector warned that Britain’s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant between 50,000 and 70,000 people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add “loss of sense of smell” to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a “slippery opponent”. How revealing: there’s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour’s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he’s bereft when his old bluster can’t beguile away deaths.Trust is ebbing away just when it’s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school it’s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. “Only following the science,” ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.Take Matt Hancock’s dumbfounding claim on Friday: “Right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes … we’ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.” What sentient voter doesn’t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes – some close to bankruptcy – were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public’s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes will be tested by early June – but will that be every week, with prompt results?“Following the science” often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she backed Johnson’s plan not to ban large gatherings, noting: “We’ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don’t want to disrupt people’s lives.” She defended a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.” She called the UK “an international exemplar in preparedness” and told doctors to have a “more adult” conversation about the lack of PPE. She reiterated advice that it was “very unlikely” care homes would be infected.This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock’s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out – almost double the number of iniduals actually tested – were instantly tripped up by the BBC’s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it’s not fair he’s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive union consultation. When the British Medical Association backed the teachers, doctors came under attack: that certainly won’t end well.Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if “levelling up” is still Johnson’s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones – for example, to Wiltshire more than to Knowsley on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories’ favoured regular enemy, as they force him to raise public transport fares in London.But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel’s refusal to lift the £625-a-year NHS surcharge on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn’t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner – but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public’s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48950dd59255a0d7429ecb42741d2c6f20f00036/0_170_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=23469539a9e1d0277a8345cf45eaf1db","title":"sage advice britain coronavirus science government policy","story":"The public deserves to know what happened in the secretive scientific debates that have informed government policyA week ago Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee review of the UK’s Covid-19 response, said that some actions represented “the biggest failure of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetime”.On Saturday, however, when Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, and another core member of Sage, was asked the same question on Radio 4’s Today programme, he responded differently. “Advice from the scientific community was always to test as much as possible,” he said. It was a question of logistics – the capacity wasn’t there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers – simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice.This is odd because on 15 March he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK’s “world-class” modelling for the outbreak. Later, when interviewed again on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between “clamping down” and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was “coming from the modelling community”.This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government’s decision on 12 March, when the UK had 590 confirmed active cases and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline R value – the rate at which people are passing on infections to others – at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at nearly 35,000 people, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than 62,000.Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments.It’s clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline – a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI – scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn’t listen to advice from the World Health Organization’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, said: “The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.”Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over – we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now.Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven “herd immunity” strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately.Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases. Four months into this epidemic, we are not even close to having a system ready for lifting the lockdown. As an editorial in last week’s British Medical Journal declared: “Meaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, ert focus and could lead to more deaths.”The government has thus far provided the names of 60 contributors to Sage – but its core decision-making group should also be listed. Over the last two months, the British public has complied with social distancing meticulously. It has witnessed, at first hand, the greatest public health disaster in a century, and the deaths of thousands of innocent people, including more than 180 health workers and volunteers, and more than 200 care workers. The public deserves the hard data, scientific opinions and the minutes of Sage meetings – not recollections in the media from senior members – to help us all understand how we got here.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health at UCL, and a former director at the World Health Organization"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56998d320506377281b6550ee16c82887a9fa522/0_184_2666_1599/master/2666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce2137d1184944b77e37b8b3aafd641","title":"the guardian view on covid 19 and migration a ministerial power grab","story":"If the government gets its way, our coronavirus heroes may not be here to save us next timeWhy is the government pressing ahead with an immigration policy that was designed for a world that no longer exists? Brexit’s strident rhetoric posited falsehoods about migrant workers being behind depressed wages, housing shortages and stressed public services. But that was before coronavirus. Many Britons have woken up now to the fact that vital sectors in the NHS, social care and food production have been kept going by low-paid EU and non-European workers of the kind whose numbers the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to restrict.Ms Patel’s immigration bill claims it is introducing a points-based system, but it is more an income-based one. She proposes to end freedom of movement from the EU and apply the same salary threshold and skills requirement to prospective migrants wherever they come from. The rules are due to take effect in January and it is estimated that two-thirds of EU migrants now classed as key workers would not qualify for a work visa next year. The bill fails because the crisis has shown that salary alone is a poor guide to a person’s value to society.The political argument for a tough regime is also fading. The public was warming to immigration before the pandemic struck and there was outrage over the injustice perpetuated on a generation of Caribbean migrants in the Windrush scandal. Polls show widespread public sympathy for low-paid foreign employees in the NHS and care sector.The economic case for revisiting the policy is even stronger. The coming recession is unlikely to make Britain attractive to migrants. Travel is also probably going to remain restricted, limiting the scope to find work. Foreign students, the lifeblood of many universities and the towns that house them, will not rush back to Britain. The disruption to travel is expected to be lasting: Airbus has cut plane production by a third. It’s hard to see the sense in continuing with a bill to limit immigration when the shutdown has done that anyway.In an era of high unemployment, jobs that British workers have been able to choose not to do might be more attractive than they previously were. There has been a jump in applications to work in the NHS during the pandemic. The government will need to put more money into training and pay. It is obvious why there are so few local workers in social care when – after a decade of local government austerity – hourly pay in a largely private sector is lower than in supermarkets.Ms Patel ought to be generous and relax the proposed restrictions. She could do so without incurring political cost, as polls show support to exempt lower-paid frontline migrant workers. She did not take the opportunity in the Commons on Monday. This was a mistake. It is also wrong for Ms Patel to force foreign health staff to pay extra to fund the NHS. Large-scale immigration changes rarely work as intended – and one this size delivered in just seven months looks no different. Labour’s Nick Thomas-Symonds was right to caution that widening the scope of ministerial sway over immigration amounted to an executive power grab.A blitzkrieg advance by ministers over immigration would be expected after Brexit, which remains the glue that holds Boris Johnson’s government together. But the Covid-19 pandemic has made the public understandably fearful. When people are anxious they tend to re-evaluate their beliefs. The shock of the virus has opened the political conversation to ideas beyond Brexit about what sort of society will work for all. For the sake of the country, the government ought to embrace them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1f9528877d89ff3a50de0f2aaae5813ff0c294/0_107_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4832b233b984d01715388fa329eace2a","title":"we should be overhauling the school system not rushing to send children back","story":"The ease with which exams were ditched shows that we could craft a model built around emotional and social development, not constant invigilationThe hierarchy of who cares most about lovely little children is confusing. Parents, I would have thought, are up there. Except the bad ones who are not home schooling, have not bought several laptops and are frantically trying to manage working at home, too.Then there are the awful ones who have to go out to work. Do they not care? Some, like me, have sacrificed their children for their political principles and sent their kids to state schools. I always love this phrase: it is wonderful that my children are still alive despite my attempt to serve them up as offerings to the fake household gods of fairness.Then there are the teachers who could be “heroes”, but are reverting to type as some kind of communists as they do not want schools to open just yet. Strangely, they are supported by many doctor heroes, who we presume do care.I heard an interview with a teacher who is also a parent and does not feel safe going back to work. I nearly malfunctioned, because, in the current discourse, this is a category error. Good teacherbad parent or bad teachergood parent?Even though I have tried to stay alert, I need some guidelines about who is the enemy of the people now. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, doing “caring” is alarming enough. “We owe it to the children” to open schools, apparently. Then along comes Michael Gove, who told local authorities unsure about all this: “If you really care about children, you’ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.”I can only conclude that I don’t really care about children, then, because, no, I don’t want kids to be in primary school by 1 June. Nor do people in many other parts of the UK, especially where the virus is still to peak. This date is only a target in England, with Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish schools all expected to reopen after the summer holidays. Many teachers are worried not only for themselves, but also for what they might pass on to their families many parents do not want their children used in an experiment on contagion.As far as we know, children tend not to suffer badly with the virus, while a study in Australia has suggested that they are not significant vectors of infection. But that is one study and “the science” is an ever-expanding, moving body. We do not know enough.We do know, however, that the physical distancing required seems almost impossible with the youngest schoolchildren. Do we pick them up when they fall over? Why can they bring in lunch boxes but not pencil cases? All these details have to be ironed out in very little time.Of course I see that year 6s and primary 7s need to say goodbye to their friends before they move on to secondary school. Of course I see that teachers can identify the most vulnerable kids in reception, year 1 and primary 1. But none of this is to do with education as such. Schools have to be reopened as giant creches to get adults back to work so the economy can go back to “normal”.This is an illusion of control and normality from a government that has failed to care. Education has always been one way in which the elite has bypassed the state. The NHS cannot be bypassed, because private medicine provides few ICUs. Teachers are a far easier group to demonise. Gove was always at war with “the Blob”, egged on by his overextended Spads, such as Henry de Zoete. He got burnt out working for Gove and once tried a week teaching in a primary school: “I realised that I couldn’t do it.” Really? I thought any fool could teach.Reopening schools requires trust between local authorities, teachers and parents, but the government is packed full of those who have systematically undermined that trust and denigrated teaching. Telling people they are safe is not the same as making them feel safe.Now is the time to re-evaluate the ideology that has driven the system. The sudden ditching of exams may have repercussions, but the ease with which it was done could point us in a new direction. We want to get children back to school for their social wellbeing as well as for their consumption of information. Kids miss their friends.We need to ask what education is for. Lockdown has exacerbated every inequality. Richer families spend much more time on schoolwork than poorer ones and are more likely to send their kids back to school. We hold on to the idea that education is the route out of poverty, but school is only one factor in this.The emotional and social development of our children is paramount, not a rushed, unsafe return to constant invigilation. Teachers are not childminders, nor are they risk-averse. You try standing up in front of 30 15-year-olds.As a strategy, alienating “the Blob” is as dumb as comparing the virus to a mugger to be rugby tackled. But what do I know? I have not had the benefit of the most physically distanced form of education – a top boarding school. Strangely, these will not be required to open in two weeks’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6070189afe34a01d9f6ded51f28270fc2a12c4c/0_188_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd9b9527ad0d3e42c387f667170fc4e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of treasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘treasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘treasure’.Share your photos of what treasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 May at 10am.

It was likely to be either the day the Utah Jazz all-star Rudy Gobert jokingly rubbed his hands over reporters’ microphones, mocking the threat of coronavirus, or when, two days later, Gobert and his teammates tested positive for the virus and the NBA season was abruptly and indefinitely suspended.Since then, sporting events have essentially evaporated the NHL, MLB and international soccer leagues suspended seasons, while the 2020 Olympics postponed until summer 2021. The loss of all sports was unprecedented, but “as shocking as these cancellations seemed at the time, the truth is there was really no choice,” Oliver said. “Sporting events with large crowds packed together are the exact opposite of social distancing and the nightmare scenario during a pandemic.”But as the pandemic and shutdowns have worn on, calls to restart sports, whose cancellation Oliver called “emphatically the right thing to do”, have increased, especially from the top. In April, Oliver reminded, President Trump told reporters: “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old, but I haven’t actually had too much time to watch … I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work.”“We actually asked some experts about that,” Oliver deadpanned, “and it turns out that when the country’s in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing many thousands of Americans every single week, the correct number of batters from 2006 for the president to be watching is actually fucking zero.”That fact aside, Oliver continued, Trump was “not entirely wrong there” as the lack of sports is an emotional and financial blow to many by one estimate, sports-related cancellations will erase $12bn in revenue and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US, which is devastating for stadium cooks, maintenance workers, ticket processors and others who depend on sporting events for work.Oliver’s main question, then, was what a path to restarting sports safely would look like, if it could be done at all. There are already examples of how to not take safety into consideration. Oliver pointed to the WWE, which has resumed filming in Florida – a state which designated professional sports and events televised for a national audience “essential services” as long as they were closed to the public – despite formal complaints from production staff that their jobs could not follow proper distancing guidelines. The UFC president, Dana White, promised a private Caribbean island of UFC fighters called “Fight Island”, which is a “perfect name”, said Oliver, because “it’s the first thought an idiot would have if they wanted to name a private island where fights happen.” But just a day before the event, one of its fighters had to pull out after he and two of his cornermen tested positive. Which underscores how “if you want to come back completely without risk, that’s just not possible right now,” Oliver said.And yet many sports organizations are under pressure to return, as “profit is a powerful motivator here, especially for some team owners who won’t be the ones taking the risk,” Oliver explained. “And it’s why major sports like baseball and football are so eagerly pursuing plans to come back. But assuming that you can’t just stage all events in Jacksonville or on some stupidly named island somewhere, how do you do it in the safest possible way?”One popular idea is the so-called “bubble leagues”, in which athletes play sports before empty stadiums, but Oliver essentially debunked the idea as too damned by its details. “When you think about that for more than a second, it all becomes much, much more complicated because, of course, you wouldn’t just be isolating players,” he explained – it also means testing and isolating the coaching staff, team physicians, umpires and clubhouse managers, camera crews and hotel staff, among others.The complications and quarantine-based separations from family are why many MLB players have resisted an idea of a bubble league, leading the MLB to walk back a proposed return in Arizona. A good plan has yet to be proposed one league official told the Washington Post “I would be lying if we were to say we have a good idea …they’re all degrees of bad.”“And that is true of so many current proposals for sports to come back,” said Oliver. “The second you start reading the details of any plan, it automatically becomes ridiculous.“So as hard as it is to hear, we might need a little more time to make sure we get this right – phasing sports back in slowly with tailored approaches that take into account each sport’s level of contact and robust systems of testing and tracing,” Oliver added. So to fill the absence in the meantime, he proposed something “with an existing infrastructure, a schedule of heart-pounding events, a passionate fanbase and no human contact”: competitive marble racing.Last Week Tonight, he revealed, is sponsoring Jelle’s Marble Runs, a Dutch competitive marble racing league (think marbles careening through sand tunnels, or down a track in front of a marble-packed “stadium”) whose all-star tournament, the 2020 Marble Games, begins in June and is, according to Oliver, “to put it mildly, absolutely fantastic”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfeee487c36fb92d3045bc9e8105384cac596bac/0_85_4998_2999/master/4998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8725d8b458088ea29fe8550d969f9b81","title":"is it safe to go back to school england coronavirus","story":"Michael Gove says children will be safe at school, but as coronavirus pandemic continues experts urge caution The Department for Education recently released an overview of advice it received from Public Health England, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and its subgroup the Children’s Task and Finish Working Group – although specific evidence from these latter groups has yet to be published.The new report points out that in general children with Covid-19 have a far milder form of the disease than adults and that, at least for children up to the age of 13, they are far less likely to show symptoms. It also notes there is some, albeit very limited evidence, that such children are less likely to become infected than adults, but it is unclear whether they transmit the virus less than adults.The report also acknowledges other countries: many in Europe have begun reopening schools with few problems, at least so far. Indeed the secretary of state for education, Gavin Williamson, has previously highlighted the lack of negative impacts in Denmark, where schools reopened in mid-April.However, experts found the “R” number – the effective reproduction number – did nudge upwards towards 1 in the first two weeks of reopening in Denmark before falling once again, while some have said that comparisons with Denmark are problematic, with Denmark having had far fewer deaths (under 550 at the time of writing).Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said that another consideration is that there have been few recorded cases of adults catching the disease from children, while there have been no outbreaks in schools around the world – although that could be down to children showing few symptoms. But, he said, teachers may be at risk from other teachers – as is the case between workers in other jobs.The new report notes it is very difficult for young children to stay 2 metres apart, but says measures such as hand washing and emphasising the need to use and bin tissues are important.Frequent cleaning of surfaces, using staggered break times and changing classroom layouts could be used – although each school is asked to carry out its own risk assessment before opening.Face masks or coverings, however, are not recommended, with the report noting that children and staff in schools will only mix in small and consistent groups. Teachers will not be expected to use personal protective equipment (PPE) unless that is already used, or a child develops symptoms of Covid-19 and contact is necessary while they are cared for before returning home.The Department for Education has said that all schoolchildren, staff and members of their households will be able to have a test for Covid-19 – if they show symptoms. If children or staff test positive, all those they mix with in the school will have to self-isolate for 14 days. However as the report itself notes, many children have very mild symptoms or none at all.No. As Boris Johnson outlined in his address on 10 May, the plan refers to England and the first children to return will be children in nurseries, reception and year 1, as well as those in the last year of primary school, year 6. These groups, it has been mooted, will return on 1 June, while other schoolchildren will return to classrooms in the weeks that follow – however this timetable is provisional.Children or staff with pre-exisiting medical conditions that could make them very vulnerable to Covid-19 will not be expected to return to school.Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, said these particular age groups had largely been picked to return on “educational and welfare grounds”.There has been a small number of cases around the world of children with a potentially deadly inflammatory syndrome that has been linked to Covid-19. However experts have stressed it is rare, affecting only one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus.Dr Liz Whittaker, a clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, has previously said the condition “shouldn’t be a factor when we reopen the schools”.Michael Tildesley of Warwick University, who works on models of the spread of diseases, said it was a possibility, depending on what happens with R. “If we do start to see the reproduction number going above 1 and cases climbing again we should be prepared to take the decision to close schools again,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5635a8a6d76d18782ddac40068a00b63d59ff219/0_189_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ba69a77869a76ae9cf14ac9ffbfdf83","title":"marking books not safe suggests new coronavirus guidance for teachers","story":"Councils warn parents not to expect schools to open on 1 June as government prepares for union talksA growing number of councils in the north of England are warning parents not to expect schools to open on 1 June, as new union guidance for teachers suggests it will not be safe to mark children’s books.Bury council in Greater Manchester is the latest to confirm that primary schools will not reopen for some pupils on the government’s target date at the start of next month, pointing out that Covid-19 infections in the area are still too high.Tamoor Tariq, lead member for children’s services, schools and families, said: “While high levels of Covid-19 infection in the north-west remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be reopening schools on 1 June.”The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will meet union leaders on Tuesday, as pressure builds on government to reopen primary schools in England to reception, year 1 and year 6.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which represents 19,000 members, said it would – with some caveats – support schools preparing to reopen from that date, after being reassured by government scientific advisers last week.A number of multi-academy trusts, which are independent of local authorities and close to government, have also supported the 1 June return to school. A growing number of councils including Liverpool, Hartlepool, Rochdale and Wigan have, however, told parents not to expect schools to reopen on the government’s deadline.Stockport council, also in Greater Manchester, has said its schools will not be ready to reopen to more pupils until 10 June at the earliest, while Slough council in Berkshire warned its parents many schools in the borough would not be accepting more children until 8 June.Fresh guidance for teachers from the country’s biggest teaching union suggests it will not be safe to mark children’s books and renews calls for PPE in schools.The National Education Union (NEU), with 45,000 members, remains unconvinced by government assurances and has issued its own guidance to primary schools, warning it is “extremely unlikely” that circumstances nationally would allow for wider reopening on 1 June.Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the advice from the Sage committee on the return of schools would be published “as soon as possible”, giving no timeframe. “We continue to want to work with schools in order to get more children back into an education setting,” he said.“We are now past the peak of the virus and it is right that we plan for the first phase of a controlled and careful return of some year groups from 1 June at the earliest. As we have always said, safety comes first, but we must also be aware of the potential damage to a child’s education from not getting them back to the classroom.”On the ground, headteachers say government ambitions to get all primary children back into school for a month before the school holidays are “unworkable”. There are also concerns that parents will be too scared to send their children to school, particularly those who are BAME because of mounting evidence that members of ethnic minority groups are particularly badly affected by the virus.Paul Harris, chief executive of the Tapscott Learning Trust which runs five primary schools in the east London borough of Newham, which had the worst mortality rate in England and Wales, said parents in his community were “very, very scared”. There have been 15 deaths from Covid among the families of staff and pupils in the Tapscott community.“When you knock on the door, all the curtains are shut. Parents will talk to you on the phone, but some of them won’t open the door. When you talk to them on the phone they make it very clear they have not been assured enough that it’s safe,” he said.The NEU meanwhile has urged its members to insist on social distancing of 2 metres in schools, though government guidance has acknowledged young children will find it impossible to observe the same rules as adults and advises instead classes of fewer than 15 and well spaced desks.The NEU guidance says: “Given that the science does not yet show that children do not transmit the virus, the NEU believes that schools should operate in the same way as other workplaces and maintain social distancing in classrooms and in movement around the school.”The guidance, which is also for members of GMB, Unite and Unison working in schools, provides a comprehensive checklist, including advice on everything from lidded bins to sanitising library books. At one point it says: “It will not be safe to mark children’s books during this period. Will clear instruction be given that no marking should take place and the books should not be taken to and from homeschool?”Schools in England have been closed to all pupils, except children of key workers and vulnerable pupils, since 20 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a96bb755c2a7ffc9629e0bd5c863277b679baab/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85250ca977db445cab1d69afc6d09cec","title":"coronavirus offers chance to create fairer uk food supply chain say experts","story":"A radical 10-year plan should draw on community crisis responses to fix ‘faultlines in our food system’A radical 10-year recovery plan for the UK food system should draw on local and community responses to the Covid-19 crisis to create a more erse, sustainable and fairer supply chain, say experts.The pandemic exposed fragility in the food supply system: farmers poured away more than a million litres of milk, supermarket shelves were stripped of flour while millers were unable to sell it, and potato farmers were forced to hoard stocks. Meanwhile, food banks faced unprecedented demand as household incomes plummeted.Sue Pritchard, the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission, said: “The pandemic has exposed the faultlines in our food system.“We’ve seen big gaps in availability of food, especially for the poor and vulnerable, and significant economic impacts on producers. This crisis demonstrates that people and business are ready to build back better.”Prof Tim Lang, whose new book Feeding Britain exposes the fragility of the UK food system before Covid-19 struck, said the crisis has concentrated power even more into the hands of the supermarkets.“This reduced economic ersity by hammering other supply chains and wasted vast resources. It’ll be hard to rein back this concentration of power.”The crisis in food supplies caused by the pandemic came as the agriculture bill, the biggest change to British agriculture and food production since 1945, was reaching its final stages in the House of Commons.The Tenant Farmers Association is calling for the bill’s introduction to be delayed until 2022 while farmers, producers and experts reflect on the problems exposed by the pandemic.An inquiry has been set up by the environment, food and rural affairs committee to analyse how Covid-19 has affected the food system. In its evidence, the TFA said the crisis exposed how inflexible the system was. Farmers who supplied to restaurants and takeaways had their outlets cut off, and were unable to ert their produce to people who needed it.“At a time when consumers were queueing up at retailers keen to buy meat, dairy and fresh produce, it was unacceptable that this demand was unfulfilled despite the fact that sufficient quantities of food were available in the country.”The TFA said the government had handed the monopoly to supermarkets in response to the crisis but the retailers had done little to change their buying patterns and source food from farmers whose markets had dried up. Some supermarkets sourced meat from Poland while British farmers were forced to stockpile.Pritchard said there were many examples of resilience in local communities which emphasised the need to build a more erse food system.Feedback, an environmental charity, said: “There is a chance for the government to treat this moment of crisis as an opportunity to reshape supply chains in ways that will be helpful in the long-term for supporting producers and reducing the environmental impacts of food production.”It is calling for the creation of a national food service to create a joined up and equitable approach to preparing and distributing meals at the local and community level.Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation, said the Covid-19 pandemic was having a material impact on what millions of adults and children were able to eat.“We desperately need a social security system which protects everyone’s right to good food, now and in the future. The system must support those who have gone into this crisis already struggling, and the millions more who have been added to their number. What we eat remains fundamentally important for our health: we need to rebuild our food system so that good food, which helps us stay healthy, is the norm.”Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, which is calling for legal guarantees against imports from countries such as the the US with lower environmental and animal welfare standards, said the government must support British farmers. “There will be a danger – and this will be a continuing danger – that as we come back to normality, we do not want to see other product dumped on this marketplace,” she said in evidence to the environment, food and rural affairs committee.“I think that is a very live challenge. Government getting behind the ‘buy British’ message, and loving British food, is incredibly important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6a7b1114b0bd28ac94570b8c206c4d722893e3b/0_307_2002_1200/master/2002.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fcbcdded221ec3026f68ecf03327a1df","title":"us dust bowl conditions likely to reoccur great plains","story":"Climate breakdown means conditions that wrought devastation across Great Plains could return to regionThe agricultural conditions known as a “dust bowl”, which helped propel mass migration among drought-stricken farmers in the US during the great depression of the 1930s, are now more than twice as likely to reoccur in the region, because of climate breakdown, new research has found.Dust bowl conditions in the 1930s wrought devastation across the US agricultural heartlands of the Great Plains, which run through the middle of the continental US stretching from Montana to Texas. The conditions are caused by a combination of heatwaves, drought and farming practices, replacing the native prairie vegetation.Those conditions occurred in the 1930s, when they exacerbated the woes that farmers were already experiencing because of the wider economy, after two record-breaking heatwaves in 1934 and 1936, which are still the hottest US summers on record.Such conditions could be expected to occur naturally only rarely – about once a century. But with rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, dust bowl conditions are likely to become much more frequent events.They are now at least two and a half times more likely to occur, with a frequency probability of about once in 40 years, according to projections by an international group of scientists published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.If global temperatures rise by more than 2C (a rise of 3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, such heatwaves will become one-in-20-year events in the region, according to the study’s authors.Farming has changed in the region since the 1930s, with more widespread use of crop irrigation. But much of that relies on groundwater, which is also being severely depleted.Huge fields, which encourage soil erosion the tendency towards growing monocultures – vast areas given over to a single crop, such as maize or wheat and a lack of natural vegetation all contribute to the creation of dust bowl conditions.“If you don’t have trees anywhere, it’s much harder to keep water in the ground,” Otto said. “What crops you grow and how large the fields are have an effect on how the ground is able to hold water.”Huge open fields with few borders have long been favoured by farmers as they are more efficient for mechanised tilling and harvesting. But in recent years some farmers have changed their practices to better conserve the soil, particularly after severe droughts in 2017.Tim Cowan, lead author and research fellow at the University of Southern Queensland, said the study concentrated on the impacts of temperature rises but that land management would have a big impact too. However, improving land management could not remedy the damage done by the climate emergency. “Even though you have better practices in cropping now, the rises in temperature reduce those benefits, so there would still be a negative impact,” he said.The researchers also found that there was a small but detectable impact from greenhouse gases on the dust bowl conditions of the 1930s.Gabi Hegerl, co-author, and professor of climate system science at the University of Edinburgh, said: “With summer heat extremes expected to intensify over the US throughout this century, it is likely that the 1930s records will be broken in the near future.”The climate model used by the researchers, developed at Oxford, runs on the personal computers of volunteers from around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a451ca99897fdc05d87ca3dce58d247554f9450/0_495_3691_2214/master/3691.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6246da1a2da03c6a7d04b632d57e7199","title":"michel piccoli a life in pictures","story":"The prolific actor Michel Piccoli, who has died aged 94, acted in dozens of films for virtually every major French director across seven decades, including Godard, Malle and Rivette here are some of the highlightsPeter Bradshaw on Michel Piccoli: a fierce, strong performer who became the object of cinephile fan-worship"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4688e3f54a96fac4e92b9825170791681e713afd/0_538_6015_3611/master/6015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937edaffb2a528e71aae7fdf70c3ff34","title":"nigel slaters top 10 spring recipes","story":"His best-loved dishes that make the most of what we have right now: shoulder of lamb, haddock fishcakes, banana tarts with cardamom creamMaybe I should stand still more often. A few moments to stop and take stock of what I have a time to curb my appetite for the new. I have certainly had the opportunity to do that in the kitchen over the past few weeks: slowly working through what I already have in the house, the freezer (not a lot to be honest) and the garden. I wouldn’t say it has been a bad thing.It has been something of a relief to clear the decks – I finally got the dried black beans out of the cupboard finished off the annoying packet of mixed rice (never buy mixed varieties of rice in one packet, they all cook at different times) and I finally demolished that giant box of nougat but only because my favourite chocolate shop was closed. I’m setting my sights on finding a use for the jar of amaranth next.Making the most of what I have has also led me on a trip through my old recipes. Some of which I cook regularly and know by heart, others I rather wish I made more often and the odd one or two I had genuinely forgotten about. I have collected together a whole bunch of my favourites: a neat package of recipes I love and feel are perfect for the unpredictable late spring and early summer, when one minute you need a salad, the next something altogether more hearty.As most of us are limited shopping-wise at the moment, most of the recipes have no more than a handful of ingredients and almost all of them contain one or two store-cupboard stalwarts. Sadly, I have had to leave out my favourite baking recipes, as I suspect most of us are still finding it tricky to get our hands on enough flour. But there is plenty here with which to celebrate, from pea fritters to roast tomatoes with sweet potato mash, a chickpea dip with roast peppers plus a buttermilk panna cotta with sesame brittle.Use whatever noodles you have around for this crisp, light salad. I have suggested brown rice noodles but only because that is what I had in the house. The dressing is at its most refreshing when sharp, sweet and hot, but tweak it to your liking, adding more palm sugar or lime juice as you wish.For the dressinglimes juice of 2light soy sauce 2 tsppalm sugar 2 tspsmall hot red or green chilli 1garlic 2 small young clovesRinse the mung beans under icy-cold running water and drain. Scrub the carrot, slice thinly lengthways, then into matchstick-size strips. Pour boiling water over the noodles and leave to soak for 10 minutes until swollen and tender. (Check the cooking instructions on the packet of the noodles you are using.)Lightly peel the cucumber, then slice in half from stalk to tip, scrape out the seeds and core with a teaspoon and discard them. Cut the cucumber into pencil-thick slices. Remove the leaves from the coriander, leave any small ones whole, and roughly chop the larger ones. Do the same with the mint leaves. Shred the pak choi.Toss the mung beans, carrot, cucumber, pak choi and herbs together. Drain the noodles and toss with the vegetables and herbs.Make the dressing: mix together the juice of the limes, the light soy and sugar. Finely chop the red chilli and add to the dressing. Peel, smash, then finely chop the garlic. Toss the dressing, vegetables, herbs and noodles together. Finally, coarsely chop the peanuts and scatter over the salad.I use shoulder for its flavour and the crispness of its fat. It is often cheaper than the leg. I am the first to admit a shoulder is less straightforward to carve than the other cuts of lamb, and I usually resort to hacking off large juicy pieces of meat, rather than the neat slices you get from a leg. But do use a leg if you prefer.Serves 4-5shoulder of lamb 2kgolive oilanchovy fillets 8rosemary sprigs 8 smallthyme sprigs 8-10For the vegetablesmixed greens 250g (purple sprouting broccoli, young beetroot leaves, red chard etc)shelled peas 250gvegetable stock or water 200mlSet the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Place the lamb in a roasting tin and rub the meat all over with olive oil and season lightly with sea salt. Pierce the meat in 16 or so places with the point of a knife, cutting 3cm or 4cm down into the flesh.Stuff eight anchovies into half the holes, rosemary tufts in the others. Scatter with the thyme, tucking a few sprigs underneath the meat.Roast the lamb for 1 hour and 30 minutes, until the fat has turned translucent and pale honey-coloured, and the meat is light rose-pink. Remove the roasting tin from the oven, lift out the meat and place somewhere warm, covering lightly with foil. Leave to rest for 15 minutes.Trim the sprouting broccoli and beetroot and chard stems, removing the leaves and setting them aside. Pour any excess oil from the tin, leaving the roasting juices in place. Place the tin over a low to moderate heat, then pour in the stock or water and bring to the boil. When the liquid starts to bubble, stir with a wooden spoon or spatula to dislodge the roasted meat juices and herbs, then add the peas, sprouting broccoli, and chard and beetroot stems. Leave the vegetables to steam in the roasting juices for three or four minutes, turning them from time to time.Add the leaves from the chard and beetroot to the pan, turn them once or twice in the hot liquid until they have wilted, then lift the vegetables out and into a warm serving dish. Turn the heat up under the roasting tin and reduce the liquid to a thin, deeply flavoured dressing. Carve the lamb on to a warm serving dish or directly on to plates, then serve with the vegetables and roasting juices.A hummus of sorts. (I am uncomfortable with calling anything by that name that contains anything other than chickpeas, garlic, lemon and oil.) I do think it is worth skinning the chickpeas (I know, I know) but once you have done so, you may never look back. You can do it painstakingly, pea by pea or simply rub them together in your palms, a handful at a time. Either way will result in a smoother mash. Your call.I have been known to sit with this and a pile of warm Turkish flatbread, but it is also a fine side dish for cold roast meats, grilled aubergines, and my favourite – deep-fried artichokes.Serves 4 as side dishred peppers 500golive oilgarlic 6 cloves, unpeeledchickpeas 2 x 400g tinsthyme 4 sprigsbay leaves 2paprika a pinch or twoSet the oven at 200C fangas mark 7. Slice the peppers in half lengthways, remove the seeds then place the halved fruit in a roasting tin. Trickle a little olive oil over the peppers, just enough to wet them, then set the unpeeled garlic cloves among them. Bake for 40 minutes or until the peppers are soft and the skin somewhat blackened. Remove from the oven, then peel away their outer skins. Reserve any juices in the roasting tin.Open the tins of chickpeas, drain and rinse them. Pop the chickpeas from their skins if you wish, then tip the peas into a saucepan, add the thyme and bay leaves and cover with water. Bring to the boil, lower the heat then simmer for 15 minutes. Drain the chickpeas, reserve a handful for later, then tip the rest into the bowl of a food processor with the roasted, skinned peppers. Pull the thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the peppers, discarding the stalks and the bay leaves. Pop the roasted garlic from its skin and add to the bowl.Process the peppers, garlic and chickpeas to a smooth cream. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Scoop the paste out into a serving dish, making a hollow in the centre with the back of a spoon.Heat the reserved chickpeas in a little olive oil in a frying pan and cook for a few minutes till they start to turn gold. Pour a little olive oil over the paste, letting it trickle into the hollow, scatter the warm chickpeas over the surface, then dust lightly with the paprika.I find the best breadcrumbs for coating fritters are the Japanese panko crumbs, available at many supermarkets.

Leave them in a colander under cold running water until thoroughly chilled. Tip the peas into the bowl of a food processor, add the tarragon leaves and process to a smooth paste.Cut the bacon into small pieces then fry in the butter in a shallow, non-stick pan till crisp. Drain on kitchen paper, add to the peas and process briefly, transfer to a bowl, then chill thoroughly for a couple of hours.Fold the egg yolks and 6 tablespoons of the breadcrumbs into the pea mixture. Pour the beaten egg into a shallow dish, and spread the remaining breadcrumbs on a plate. Shape the pea mixture into 6 short, fat barrel-shaped croquettes. Roll each croquette in the beaten egg and then in the crumbs, then chill for 20 minutes.In the same pan in which you cooked the bacon, warm the remaining butter and the oil, then fry the croquettes, over a moderate heat, gently rolling them over now and again to colour evenly. Drain, briefly, on kitchen paper and serve.As the tomatoes roast, their juices will leak into the olive oil, forming a sweet-sharp base to which is added the mustard seeds and turmeric. A handful of curry leaves, tossed in with mustard seeds, wouldn’t go amiss. Let the leaves warm for a minute or two in the hot oil with the mustard seeds, just long enough to lightly infuse the dressing with their earthy warmth.Serves 3-4sweet potatoes 850gcherry tomatoes on the vine 500golive oil 8 tbsponions 2 mediumgarlic 2 medium clovesturmeric 2 level tspyellow mustard seeds 3 tspSet the oven at 200C fangas mark 7. Peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them in half lengthways, then into thick chunks, as you might for boiling. Place the sweet potatoes in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water, then cover them with a tight lid and let them steam to tenderness – a matter of 20 minutes or so. Test them every 5 minutes with a skewer.Put the tomatoes in a shallow baking dish, tossing them with half of the olive oil and grinding over just a little salt. Roast the tomatoes for about 20 minutes until their skins have blackened. While the sweet potatoes steam and the tomatoes roast, peel and thinly slice the onions, and cook them in the remaining olive oil in a shallow pan until they are soft and golden. Peel and thinly slice the garlic and stir it into the softening onions. When the onions and garlic are ready, scoop them out into a small bowl.Drain the juices from the tomatoes into the pan in which you cooked the onions and place over a moderate heat, then stir in the turmeric, letting it sizzle for a moment, then add the mustard seeds and a little black pepper. As soon as the mustard seeds start to pop, remove from the heat. Mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher then stir in the turmeric, mustard seeds and cooking juices.Spoon the spiced sweet potato mash on to plates, add the cooked onions and garlic and the roast tomatoes.Makes 16, enough for 4 peoplepotatoes 500g, floury and white fleshedhaddock or cod fillet 500gmilk 400gwater 200mlparsley stalks 6bay leaves 3black peppercorns 8dill fronds 20gbreadcrumbs 100g, fine and fresheggs 2olive or groundnut oil a little to cookFor the parsley saucebutter 40gplain flour 40gparsley 40gdouble cream 150mlPeel the potatoes and cut them into large pieces, lower them into a deep pan of boiling water and let them cook for 20-25 minutes. They are done when they are tender enough to pierce effortlessly with a skewer. Drain the potatoes and leave for 5 minutes.Put the fish into a pan, pour in the milk and water and add the parsley, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring the liquid to the boil, lower the heat and leave to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the fish is lightly cooked. You should be able to pull the flakes apart with relative ease. Set the fish aside.Mash the potato. It should be smooth but not gluey. Finely chop the dill and add to the potato. Remove the fish from the milk, break into large flakes then combine lightly with the potato. Take care not to crush the fish.Roll the fish and potato mixture into 16 balls of approximately equal size, place on a tray and refrigerate for half an hour.Scatter the breadcrumbs on a plate. Break the eggs into a small mixing bowl and beat lightly. Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan, add the flour and stir together, cooking lightly over a moderate heat for 4 or 5 minutes, stirring almost constantly. Pour in the reserved milk from cooking the fish, discarding the aromatics as you go. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat, stirring until you have a smooth sauce. Chop the leaves from the parsley. Pour in the cream, add the parsley and correct the seasoning. Cover to stop a skin forming and set aside.Remove the fishcakes from the fridge and drop them, one at time, first into the beaten egg and then the breadcrumbs. Place the crumbed balls on a tray. Warm a shallow layer of oil in a nonstick frying pan, add the cakes without crowding the pan and let them colour evenly, moving them around the pan as necessary. Remove, drain briefly on kitchen paper and serve with the parsley sauce.Serves 4onions 3 mediumolive oil 6 tbsp, plus extra for frying the hakechorizo 300gthyme 6 bushy sprigstomatoes 750g smalljudion or butter beans 425g, bottled or tinnedhake 1.2kg, cut into 4 steaksmanzanilla or similar medium-dry sherry 150mlPeel the onions, cut them in half and roughly chop them. Warm the oil in a roasting tin over a moderate heat, then add the onions and let them cook, stirring regularly, until they are soft and translucent. Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 7.Slice the chorizo into pieces the length of a wine cork, add them to the onions together with the whole sprigs of thyme and let the sausage colour lightly. Slice the tomatoes in half, then stir them through the onions together with the drained and rinsed beans.In a separate, shallow, nonstick pan, warm the extra oil and, when it is hot, lower in a couple of the fish steaks. Let them colour lightly on the underside without cooking them right through, then turn and do the same on the other side. As each piece of fish becomes ready, transfer to the roasting tin, tucking them among the tomatoes and onions. Repeat with the remaining two pieces of fish. Once they are done, pour off any oil from the frying pan, return to the heat, and pour in the manzanilla, letting it bubble as you scrape at the sticky bits with a wooden spatula. Tip over the fish.Place in the preheated oven and bake for 35 minutes until the fish is done. Place the fish, onions, beans and tomatoes on deep, warm plates, spooning over the juices as you go.The roasting juices form part of the dressing, but you could easily use cold chicken left from a Sunday roast, adding a little more dressing as necessary. If you are not eating this immediately, I would be tempted to add the coriander at the last minute.Set the oven at 200C fangas mark 7. Put the thighs into a roasting tin, rub them generously with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 45 minutes or until the skin is crisp and the thigh juices run clear when pierced with a skewer.Peel the ginger and slice into matchsticks. Halve the chillies lengthways, de-seed if you wish, then slice finely. Peel and finely slice the garlic.Take the chicken from the oven, remove from the tin, then leave to rest for 10 minutes before tearing the flesh from the bones in large pieces and dropping them into a mixing bowl. Place the cooking juices in the tin over a moderate heat, add the ginger and garlic and let them colour to a warm, nutty brown. Add the sliced chilli for the last minute or so, then remove all from the heat.Stir the sesame oil into the ginger and chilli dressing, the Thai fish sauce and the rice wine vinegar. Squeeze the limes, stir the juice into the dressing then check the seasoning.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the sesame seeds until golden then add them to the dressing. Roughly tear the mint and coriander leaves and mix them with the chicken, then carefully fold together the chicken and the ginger dressing.The thinnest of tarts. It is worth rolling the pastry as finely as you can. Try placing the pastry on the baking sheet before adding the bananas. It makes life much easier than transferring them fully laden.For the cardamom creamgreen cardamom pods 10double cream 250mlicing sugar 1 tbspvanilla extractSet the oven at 220C fangas mark 9. Place a baking sheet in the oven to heat up.Melt the butter in a small pan, remove from the heat and set aside. Roll out the pastry very thinly, then cut out 4 discs about 12cm in diameter. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.Peel the bananas and slice thinly, then place in a single, slightly overlapping layer on each disc. Brush the bananas and the rims of the pastry with the butter then dust generously with the icing sugar.Place the baking sheet on the heated sheet in the oven and bake for 12 minutes. Remove from the oven then trickle the maple syrup over the bananas and return to the oven for 5 minutes until the pastry is deep golden brown and the fruit is sticky and glistening.Meanwhile, make the cream. Crack open the cardamom pods and extract the dark seeds, then crush to a powder using a spice mill or pestle and mortar. You need 2 tsp of the ground spice. Pour the cream into a cold mixing bowl and add the icing sugar, ground cardamom and a couple of drops of vanilla extract. Beat till thick, stopping once the cream will hold its shape on the whisk.Serve the tarts hot from the oven, with the cardamom cream.For the sesame brittlesesame seeds 50gcaster sugar 80gYou will need 4 small ramekins or cups.To make the sesame brittle, have ready a nonstick baking sheet. Warm a shallow pan over a moderate heat, sprinkle the sesame seeds over the surface of the pan in a single layer. Watch carefully, shaking the pan from time to time, until the seeds are pale gold. Scatter the sugar over the seeds and leave to melt. As the sugar melts and turns gold, tip the pan left and right so the sugar melts evenly. Very gently, stir any bits that are browning into the middle of the pan. As soon as the sugar is honey-coloured, tip on to the baking sheet, smoothing into a thin pool, then leave to set. Remove from the sheet by prising a palette knife underneath.To make the panna cotta, put the gelatine leaves in a small bowl of cold water to soften.Pour the cream into a small, nonstick saucepan, add the sugar then bring almost to the boil. Remove from the heat, gently squeeze the water from the softened gelatine, add to the cream and let the gelatine dissolve. Pour the buttermilk into the cream and gelatine, stir gently then pour through a fine sieve over a jug.Pour the panna cotta mixture into the 4 small moulds, place in the fridge and leave to set for four hours.Crush the praline coarsely using a pestle and mortar or the back of a wooden spoon. Melt the chocolate in a small bowl over simmering water.To serve, unmould the panna cotta. An easy way to do this is to dip the dishes into hot water, run a palette knife around the edge to loosen them, then turn upside down on to a little dish. A firm shake should dislodge the panna cotta from its home.Spoon the chocolate over the panna cotta, then crumble over the crushed sesame praline.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bebe9fec1dcad84552ff8c56f63d2cd7fa81e682/0_198_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4defde956b09fc6d20331b8d4241302c","title":"celtic scottish title triumph not diminished by cold climax","story":"They were the best team in Scotland during 2019-20 – by any reasonable barometer, their advantage over Rangers would have been pressed homeIt has seemed impossible to decouple bitterness relating to Celtic’s title win from the reality of it being a perfectly valid outcome. Perhaps that was a useful byproduct for some of those immersed in the almighty row that recently engulfed the Scottish scene.Celtic were the finest team in Scotland in 2019-20. The abbreviated season is surely a frustration for Neil Lennon and his players as outsiders look to diminish a ninth championship in succession. The sniping does not matter and how Celtic choose to celebrate is entirely up to them. There are of course deeper problems to ponder but a trophy retained by Monday morning Zoom call denies fans a moment in time. They will compensate for that as best they can.The lead over Rangers – 13 points with eight games to play – would have been pressed home and in Odsonne Édouard, Celtic had the best player for good measure. Whereas clubs understandably object to being relegated when a season finishes short of a natural conclusion, the awarding of prizes when the situation was a fait accompli should be far less contentious. “Should” being the operative word.Celtic have cause to rue extenuating circumstances. Nine is Scotland’s magic number, matching the record for successive league titles. This run has the backdrop of Rangers being out of the top flight for four seasons and football’s coronavirus-triggered suspension.Lennon and Celtic fans have no reason to care. When the objective is to be the leading side in Scotland, weakness of opposition is not their problem. The target has been met comfortably. Celtic drew two matches and lost two while returning a goal difference of 70. Celtic averaged 2.67 points – and 2.97 goals – per league fixture.Celtic deserve particular credit for a stirring response to defeat in the Old Firm match on 29 December. Rangers sat two points behind their oldest foes with a game in hand. Giddy analysis – not from Steven Gerrard, it must be noted – suggested a title battle worthy of the name was imminent but Celtic returned from their subsequent mid-season break in inspired form while Rangers wilted.Gerrard has succeeded in separating Rangers from the rest as the Premiership’s second force but there remains no compelling case to argue Celtic’s stranglehold will be loosened anytime soon. It would take a seismic shift for them to be denied a perfect 10.A key Celtic strength lies in their sellable assets. Moussa Dembélé and Kieran Tierney earned the club almost £45m without a domestic threat emerging. Édouard has admirers in England and abroad, Callum McGregor and Ryan Christie likewise. The development of Kristoffer Ajer, Christopher Jullien, Jeremie Frimpong and Mikey Johnston could result in more football and balance sheet success.It remains a troublesome balancing act to assemble a squad capable of making European inroads when Ross County, Hamilton and St Johnstone are the staple diet but Celtic have managed their resources smartly.There is symmetry to Lennon, who presided over the first of the nine titles, being back at the helm. The 48-year-old, by widespread acknowledgment more calm than during his first Celtic tenure, will take great pride in matching the record.He has done it from a complicated standpoint. There were murmurs of discontent when Lennon succeeded Brendan Rodgers, who made fundamental changes to Celtic. There have been bumps in the road – a comprehensive Europa League defeat by Copenhagen, mainly – but Lennon has returned to the frontline with a minimum of fuss and arguably enhanced many elements of the team’s performance.Historical comparisons are an Old Firm staple. Nonetheless, it feels futile to judge this Celtic against the one who cantered to nine titles from 1966. A year later, they were champions of Europe during a spell when Scottish clubs could go toe to toe with the best. Societal and economic changes are such that football – the game and business – is unrecognisable from that period. Many nations – including new ones – have left Scotland behind.Even Rangers’ version of nine in a row, achieved from 1989, is not a valid parallel given they could compete financially against European giants. If those from Glasgow’s blue half seek to demean their rivals’ success on the basis of weakness elsewhere, the financial implosion at Celtic in the early 1990s is a counterpoint.It would be naive to disregard the modest scale of the challenge facing Celtic domestically. Only those with vested interests can suggest the championship monopoly or duopoly that has existed since Aberdeen were kings in 1985 is healthy. However, Celtic’s place on top of the mountain is beyond question. It would be churlish to allow rancour to overshadow their achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1bc1cebd68cb337b4960287afb42ecb7f9ac16d/0_205_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3fdb468cb7f4aeb9bfd46355eec123e","title":"werder bremen v bayer leverkusen bundesliga live updates","story":"The superb Kai Havertz scored twice in the first half as Leverkusen’s exciting young side strolled to victory in Bremen Well, that’s all for tonight’s blog. It was enjoyable enough, and with each passing game it feels a little less strange. See you at the weekend, all being well, for another round of matches. Thanks for your company - goodnight!“I note the cameras cut away from the last celebration,” says Liz White. “Playing football probably isn’t, strictly speaking, safe. In Germany where there’s less community transmission, it’s possibly safe-ish. I guess since football is one of the most visible re-openings, it’s good for them to model not hugging and jumping all over each other.”Aren’t they all being tested every day? I know what you mean about the celebrations but they have generally been very restrained. Every now and then, players are going to forget themselves in the excitement of the moment. I’m not sure you can eradicate that.Leverkusen pick up where they left off before spring break with a crushing victory. Kai Havertz scored two first-half headers, Mitchell Weiser added another and Kerem Demirbay finished things off with a lovely goal. Bremen were not dreadful they were just outclassed. 89 min Baumgartlinger’s cross is shanked towards his own goal by Maximilian Eggestein, forcing Pavlenka to change direction and tip it over the bar. That was a fine reaction save.87 min Tapsoba sets Leverkusen on the counter with a smooth interception and pass out of defence. He looks a fine prospect, although tonight hasn’t been the stiffest test.81 min After a slow start, Leverkusen have been really impressive. They’ve now won 13 of their last 15 games in all competitions and are only a point behind RB Leipzig in fourth.Lovely goal. The substitute Bellarabi moves infield from the right and flicks a no-look through pass with the outside of the right foot to find Demirbay in the area. He waits for Pavlenka to go down and dinks the ball gently over him.77 min “Looks like compliance with the ‘non-contact’ celebration rule didn’t last very long,” says Ron Stack. “Hard to tell the difference between pre- and post-lockdown versions after Leverkusen’s last goal. Doubt it will be much different when PL restarts. Not being prudish here, but it makes the football organizations look unserious, and their plans unrealistic.”I’m probably missing something, but I don’t understand the fuss over celebrations. Either the game is safe, in which case they can celebrate goals with a game of Twister if they like, or it isn’t. That said, it does still feel like a big problem is lurking in plain sight, presumably to reveal itself the moment the Premier League resumes.76 min Friedl is booked for a foul on Bellarabi.75 min Johannes Eggestein moves into the area, chops back onto his left foot and has a shot blocked. Bremen have had their moments, despite being outclassed by a fine Leverkusen side, and based on tonight I wouldn’t write them off as relegation certainties.72 min “Your 53rd minute reference to that German player ‘breaking dangerous’ gives me an idea for a Netflix series,” says Ian Copestake.Is it like The A-Team?71 min Two more changes for Bremen: Joshua Sargent and Nick Woltemade replace Bittencourt and Selke. And another for Leverkusen: Julian Baumgartlinger replaces Amiri. Hit the music.70 min The resulting corner, curled in from the right by Demirbay, skims off the head of a Bremen defender at the near post and flies just wide of the far post.69 min Havertz, who is on a hat-trick, clips a shot that deflects just wide off Gebre Selassie.66 min Sinkgraven’s sharp low cross finds Bailey, who whips a shot into the side netting at the near post. This could get ugly for Bremen. 64 min Bellarabi’s stinging low shot is palmed away by Pavlenka, but only to Havertz, whose follow-up shot is blocked.63 min A couple of changes for Leverkusen: Leon Nailey and Karim Bellarabi replace Moussa Diaby and the 17-year-old debutant Florian Wirtz. Diaby was terrific, making two goals Wirtz, though understandably peripheral, produced a few touches of class.62 min Just before the goal, the impressive Gebre Selassie’s cross fell just behind the flat-footed Selke. And moments after the goal, Maximilian Eggestein shot wide from the edge of the area after an inviting cutback from Selke. He should have done better there, though he might have slipped as he made contact.Moments after Bremen almost equalise, Leverkusen double their lead. It was again created by Diaby, who teased a lofted cross towards the six-yard line from the left side of the area. The right-back Mitchell Weiser, arriving late, slammed a downward header past Pavlenka.59 min There has been a difference in class throughout this game, and it feels like a matter of time before Leverkusen get a third.57 min “Another good idea from hockey: an organ player!” says Liz White. “Every arena has an organ player to lead the crowd between plays. One organist used to play Three Blind Mice as the ref and linesmen took the ice. I await your comment.”56 min Vogt waves an elbow in the direction of Amiri - it didn’t really connect - and then has words with the Leverkusen bench. He’s not exactly high on life right now.54 min The first substitution: Johannes Eggestein, whose brother Maximilian is already on the pitch, replaces Bargfrede for Bremen.53 min Moisander is booked for a foul on Havertz, who was breaking dangerous down the right. Havertz is still only 20. Germany have found another one, haven’t they.49 min A poor touch from Demirbay ends a promising attack from Leverkusen, who have made a fast start to the second half. 48 min “We should spare a thought,” says Ian Copestake, “for those frontline workers in the commentary box having to decide whether to go full redbull and fill the silence with inanities or just do a snooker commentary. Oh and that’s a bad miss.”It must be even harder when they’re commentating from home, forever living in fear that the doorbell will ring and the dog will go off on one. 47 min Leverkusen almost grab a third. Diaby’s through ball finds Havertz on the left of the box his attempted cutback is blocked by the keeper Pavlenka, and then Demirbay’s follow-up cross is headed clear.46 min Good play from Eggestein, who slaloms past a defender on the edge of the Leverkusen box and hits a shot that is blocked by Sven Bender.46 min “Clubs using this crisis as an opportunity to introduce music during the match is worrying,” says Colin Flint. “You can see it happening for substitutions with each player getting to choose their theme tune. I think baseball players hadhave this when they come up to bat. Music already destroys the atmosphere. I can’t stand the blaring of ‘Blaydon Races just before kick-off at St James’ Park as you can’t hear the crowd.” What’s the harm in a bit of music to announce every change, in association with our official substitution partner?46 min Peep peep! Bremen begin the second half.Peep peep! Leverkusen lead through two headers from the prolific Kai Havertz, who is playing up front tonight. They have dominated possession throughout, though Bremen have had their moments on the counter-attack and Leonardo Bittencourt should have equalised shortly before half-time.45 min Or perhaps not. Gebre Selassie flashes a dangerous ball across the face of goal, just in front of Rashica and then Selke’s hopeful long-range header loops over the bar.45 min Bremen look like they need the half-time break. They’ve spent most of the half shuffling left and right, trying to keep their defensive shape.44 min “I haven’t been this enthused about German Football since I found out about the phrase ‘Die Mannschaft’,” says Matt Dony. “Actually, that’s a lie. I’ve always had a soft spot for the Bundesliga, but I try not to sound like a hipster. (That ship might have sailed.)“I still can’t think of Leverkusen without seeing Ballack on the edge of the area, dummying a shot on his right, and Gerrard buying the dummy with such ferocious commitment he’d almost left the stadium by the time Ballack scored with his left. A sad memory, but it led indirectly to THAT Zidane volley. So I guess it all worked out in the end.”43 min Sven Bender is booked for a hapless lunge at Bittencourt.39 min: Bittencourt misses a great chance! Bremen should be level. Veljkovic played a fine pass, straight down the middle, to put Bittencourt through on goal. He took the ball nicely in his stride on the edge of the area but then smashed his shot into orbit.39 min “Watching in Canada,” says Eli Whi. “In hockey games, there’s music every time play stops until it resumes (new song each time, not a whole song in snippets. Rarely Seven Nation Army.) Of course there’s more stops because there’s a faceoff each time the goalie holds the puck. Maybe something like that. If they play music all the time, it’d be too much like a school fun day.”We can’t be having music during the match, surely. Anyway, I think we’ll adjust to the lack of atmosphere pretty quickly.38 min Rashica cuts infield from the left and shoots a few yards wide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b561a735cfa867c676913557d5ebcd46832a8c4b/0_477_6666_4003/master/6666.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=aa463d0bcdccfb0cdfa32ce0172cfaaa","title":"how we met i had this surge of adrenaline i just had to get to know her","story":"Andrew and Tanja Bone, 61 and 55, met in Sarajevo during the Bosnian war. They live in Scotland with their two rescue dogsAndrew Bone was working as a truck driver for the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1993, distributing food and medicine to war-torn areas of Bosnia. At the end of the year, he flew to Sarajevo to cover for another staff member. “It was a desperate situation to fly into,” he says. “I was whisked straight up to the organisation’s headquarters in a bullet-proof Land Rover.” That’s where he spotted Tanja Todorovic for the first time. “I had this surge of adrenaline. I just felt that I had to get to know her. It sounds like a silly fairytale but it’s true.”At the time, Tanja was working as a senior field officer for the charity. Andrew got the chance to speak to her properly when they were sent to deliver aid to a home for people with learning disabilities. “Andy was so kind to the people who lived there,” says Tanja. “He was handsome too. All this long, blonde, curly hair. It’s all gone now, of course,” she laughs.Shortly afterwards, Tanja had to go to Pale for a work mission and asked Andrew to be her driver. “The road back was shelled while we were there,” he says. “We ended up having to spend the night in Pale. We had drinks together and that’s the night that we started our relationship.”A couple of weeks later, Andrew’s cover came to an end and he was sent back to Zagreb. “I was distraught. I went to the radio room and begged the operators to let me talk to her.” They told him it was impossible. “Eventually though they said they were nipping out for coffee and I was able to get hold of Tanja to tell her I loved her.”Shortly afterwards, Tanja travelled to Zagreb to meet Andrew. “I had a Red Cross passport, which meant I was able to travel out of the war zone,” she explains. They discussed the future of their relationship and whether Tanja should return to Sarajevo. They knew they wanted to be together and had big decisions to make.The situation was complicated by the fact that they were both married at the time. “My marriage wasn’t working out and Tanja was separated but it was really hard,” says Andrew. “Back then, Britain was sympathetic to refugees coming from Bosnia, so we decided it would be best to come here and be together, away from the war.”Tanja applied for asylum and the pair were able to marry at the end of 1994, once their orces were finalised. “I then got indefinite leave to remain and in 1999 I got my British citizenship,” she says.Over the next 10 years, they moved around the UK, living in Norfolk, London, Leicester and Scotland. Andrew continued to work as a truck driver, while Tanja took on various roles including working for the Refugee Council and launching an organic fruit and vegetable shop in Leicester.In 2004, she went back to university to train as a nurse and the couple moved to London. However, they soon realised they weren’t ready to stop exploring. “From 2009 to 2019, we travelled around the UK by boat, moving from place to place,” says Tanja. They worked when they needed to and enjoyed their nomadic lifestyle.When Andrew became ill with cancer 18 months ago, they moved to a permanent base in Dumbarton, Scotland. “I feel really lucky to have had such incredible care at the hands of the NHS. I had some surgery just before lockdown and they now think I am cancer-free,” he says. Tanja is still working as a nurse, and the pair have been enjoying daily walks together. “We love the countryside here,” says Tanja. “When it’s safe, we will go back to hiking in the Highlands.”It’s been 26 years since they met, but Andrew says he is more in love than ever. “She is my best friend and my everything. Nothing has changed for me since the moment we met.” Tanja feels the same. “Meeting each other has been truly life-changing. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened for either of us.”Want to share your story?

This week: an apple tree that has been the focus of family life for decadesWe have an apple tree in our garden. It was grown from a seedling that was given as a school prize more than 80 years ago to the brother of the woman we bought our house from.We’ve been living here for 40 years. The tree is a constant in our lives – we see it from our windows and pass it when we arrive and leave the house. It makes me feel at home. All our family – sons, daughters, grandchildren – and friends have climbed it.Every autumn, large apples thump on to the lawn and flower beds. I use them to make chutney from a recipe in Elizabeth Craig’s cookery book, to give as presents and store in the cupboard well into summer.During this strange time in lockdown, we’ve been spending more time watching how the tree comes to life. I love seeing the leaves catch the light, the colour of the blossom, and forget-me-nots pushing up through decomposing apple mulch. It never fails to make us feel good.• Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in the form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f837f8e0e0296bebd39eec4d82b526f9f413d82/466_128_2348_1409/master/2348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8d25e270d94305658e3184ce04705e","title":"kaiser chiefs how we made i predict a riot","story":"‘It was inspired by a hectic night at a club we ran – people were taking their clothes off and hanging from ceiling pipes’We never wrote a love song in the Kaiser Chiefs. At the time of I Predict a Riot, I was inspired by tracks like Sharp Darts by the Streets, songs that were gritty and real. The inspiration for the verses came from me DJing at the Cockpit in Leeds, and at the end of the night we’d drive home past this club called the Majestyk. There was always a big snarl-up there, loads of people in the road, police everywhere.I remember seeing one guy punch someone from behind. It was horrible. He was puffing his chest out, and a policeman instantly handcuffed him. There’d be girls with no shoes on, so there’s that line: “If it wasn’t for chip fat they’d be frozen.” I don’t think Leeds nightlife is like that any more, although to be honest I haven’t been out in the city centre at two in the morning for about 10 years.When Ricky and I wrote lyrics, we were always trying to make each other laugh. The line “Not very pretty I tell thee” came from the Craig David character in Bo’ Selecta! John Smeaton was a lighthouse designer, and a Leodensian means someone from Leeds.My favourite thing in the world is to start a new song. Every time, you think: “This is going to be the big one.” It rarely is, but anything can happen – like with I Predict a Riot. Every band has a best song – and that was ours.We’d already written loads of songs for our debut album, Employment, and we’d released Oh My God with the label and website Drowned in Sound, and its editor Sean Adams told us: “You need another song as good as that, or better”. The verse for I Predict a Riot had already been brought into rehearsals and gone round and round until we were sick of it.I remember being frustrated, but after that Black Wire gig, we played it through with that new chorus. We recorded it, and I said to Nick: “That’s it. That’s totally brilliant.”I was obsessed with the Clash at the time and wanted to emulate what their bass player, Paul Simonon, was doing. There’s a darkness to the song. It’s in C minor. We were trying to do this spooky singalong. One article I read said the lyric was us looking down on people, sneering at them. But I never thought that. The lyrics were just observations.We did the section where the vocals build up because, when we started out, our sets only lasted 25 minutes so we knew that’s how long we had to get people’s attention. So we’d try every trick. It’s like a modern take or a darker version of Twist And Shout. We did that same trick on about five songs on Employment. In the end, we had to stop because we’d done it so much.When you look on Spotify’s streaming numbers, Ruby is our biggest song. But I Predict a Riot has the best reaction live, all around the world. We played it at a festival in Poland for hundreds of thousands of people, and it felt apocalyptic, like something was going to go wrong. Everyone was going crazy. I remember thinking that there wasn’t enough security, and if people had wanted to revolt, it was all over.But even at the worst gigs, it’s good to have it in your setlist. We’ve played a few black-tie events and it can be a bit stiff. But then you play I Predict a Riot and you’ve got guys with ties on their heads. That’s the time I’m most thankful for the song.• Kaiser Chiefs’ new album, Duck, is out now on Polydor Records. Nick Hodgson’s solo album Tell Your Friends is available from Prediction Records."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3063777210d8c4a14de57fb69a03dfec6fc2026/3_0_5899_3543/master/5899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=066ef2ea7659238c2e0a229e01771ce0","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown podcast part 2","story":"In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinnerIn part 1 of our Blind Date takeover last week, three couples met up via Zoom and let us listen in to what a first date sounds like in the age of lockdowns.

Thrown almost overnight into a virtual classroom, they are using video games and creating group chats or escape rooms for pupils. The internet gives teachers access to subject experts from around the world who can deliver masterclasses via video link to an entire year group.The health emergency is creating new opportunities, which they say will transform the way they teach forever.Lee Small is head of computer science at Ribblesdale high school, in Clitheroe, Lancashire. He says: “We have had to think differently and dynamically. I think we will go on to put some of these different technologies to use in the classroom to support students’ learning alongside traditional teaching methods.”Ribblesdale has Microsoft Training Academy status, which means it is at the forefront of using cutting-edge technology in its teaching. It is also a Demonstrator school, one of 20 schools and colleges identified by the DfE and delivery partners that have demonstrated excellence in their use of technology to support teaching and learning, and have the capacity to help others.Teachers realised immediately that if remote learning was to work they would have to design shorter lessons that were quick to engage pupils, with speedy outcomes, otherwise students risked becoming passive observers.The key was to use platforms that pupils were familiar with. At Ribblesdale that meant tapping into the video game Minecraft. “It’s an amazingly popular game and is an incredibly powerful teaching tool,” says Small. It has been invaluable in English lessons to support children who struggle to express themselves in the written word: “They’ve been able to design their story in the Minecraft world and then write about it when they see their idea on the screen.”In Warrington, Cheshire, teachers at the King’s leadership academy learned how to use the principles and theory of video games, with graded challenges and teamwork, to design more engaging remote lessons: “We’ve had to make the lessons more exciting and had to make sure that the children find a purpose in what they are doing,” says principal Shane Ierston.In Berkshire, maths teacher Lewis Hart, of University Technical College (UTC) Reading, says lockdown has made him think more creatively about how he teaches and collaborates: “I can’t rely on a combination of verbal and written. I’ve had to come out of my comfort zone.”Hart turned to YouTube for inspiration: “One of my favourites is the 3Blue1Brown channel, devoted to high school maths but it looks at it in a different way, at the deeper underlying fundamentals, which has been a really good way of getting students to look at familiar topics in an unfamiliar way.”UTC Reading is part of the national network that is using technology to enhance teaching in the traditional and virtual classrooms. The Surface laptop, for example, has dual far-field studio mics and an HD camera which ensure that teachers can be heard and seen clearly when in contact with students or colleagues.The school has used Microsoft Teams so teachers can continue their teacher training during lockdown. It has also created a video bank of lessons so students who may have missed classes can catch up in their own time, and there is potential to work remotely with school refusers in future. Siobhan Tyson, UTC’s director of science with additional responsibility for professional development, says the technology is transformative: “It is giving us flexibility and it’s definitely going to have an impact on future teaching.”Teachers admit it can be a constant battle to keep their tech skills ahead of their pupils’, or what their pupils expect. Ribblesdale has 10 Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts (MIEE) – staff skilled in delivering the Microsoft schools programme who share their expertise with colleagues. But Small points out: “Teachers don’t have to be experts in a piece of software in order to use it, they just need to be able to use it to give a platform to students to be creative and foster their independence.”Collaboration with peers has been crucial during lockdown as teachers share remote teaching ideas, so the Surface can be useful as it is designed to encourage closer working and allows teachers to easily share resources. English teacher and vice-principal at King’s, Katie Sharp, says working collaboratively has, for her, been essential during lockdown. “I’m a person who likes working with people, so this has been quite a culture shock for me. But we’ve been able to share links to each other’s lessons, which means we can give feedback if I see something I like, such as a quiz, I can ask how they do that.”This new way of working has also prompted teachers to think about how digital technology has a role in marking and assessment, says Small: “We’ve been looking at how we can use AI to support students in their grades, for example we have an app on Teams where we can tell how long students have engaged with the content.”But remote learning only works if pupils have access to a device and reliable broadband. Schools have sometimes used the pupil premium to cover device costs and given pupils dongles to tap into phone technology if broadband is poor.Teresa Skeggs is headteacher of Peartree Spring primary, in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where each year-group has access to devices of various kinds. It uses Microsoft 365 to deliver its whole-school email, while its server and some of its laptops “consistently” rely on Windows 10. She says: “What we are delivering now is a more in-depth version of what we have always done – we’ve always had blended learning.”Five tips for online teaching:1. Think differently about how you teach. Teaching remotely is more than just going online. Technology used creatively can be transformative.2. Keep your talking to a minimum – bite-size chunks of around five minutes. The voice is important but students do not need to see you to hear you. Captioning all videos means they are accessible to everyone.3. Consider dropping your headshot into the corner of the screen if you feel students still need to see you when talking. Use pictures with captions as well as slides to illustrate as you talk. Keep things simple.4. Lessons must be engaging and inclusive, gain student interest quickly and have quick outcomes. Use programs and platforms that are familiar to pupils to create a fun learning experience of quizzes and games.5. Create small groups on tools such as Teams to encourage group discussion. Encourage students to ask questions through a chat panel.Interested in finding out more about how to create engaging online learning environments?

Headteachers explain how it’s doneWhen it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”Today’s tech makes it much simpler to make those tweaks – and schools which had been exploring its possibilities before the lockdown have already considered many of the big questions around online safety. Choosing devices that can be rolled out with ease is a key consideration in reducing IT complexity. At University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, pupils had already received training on professional behaviour both face-to-face and online. “They know what’s right and what’s wrong, and the consequences of doing something that is outside what we would consider professional,” says principal Jon Nicholls. “And they get it. We have close ties with industry, and our students understand professional boundaries.”However, a secure platform is also crucial. UTC Reading’s Microsoft Teams package has considerable functionality for keeping both students and staff safe online. All student data is held securely. Only invited students can attend classes – nobody else can join. Teachers can invite students into small groups for additional support work without other students being aware. Another teacher or learning support staff member is always online to actively monitor student chat. And lessons are recorded and stored – including any chat – so they can be checked if any concerns are raised by staff or students.Choosing the correct platform can also help to solve the problem of device access. There has been an explosion of cloud-based learning platforms and tools in the education sector that are designed to be used solely in a web browser, says Brendan Tapping, chief executive officer at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust, a multi-academy trust that serves south Tyneside, Sunderland and east Durham.“This has overcome many of the hurdles that students would have faced when trying to complete work from home. The cloud-based learning platforms allow students to complete their homework anytime, anywhere from almost any device, including their own mobile phones,” he says.These platforms are also key to allowing staff to easily communicate, collaborate and share learning resources, tips and strategies, helping to replicate face-to-face staffroom discussions and prevent teachers themselves from feeling isolated.But although being online has its own risks, the biggest risk for a child is living in an environment where threats exist – and lockdown could mean more risk for them. How can schools keep track of them in an online-only environment? Again, they’re using established best practice combined with tech and the art of good communication.At Ribblesdale, the school’s online learning platform, Teams, logs everything – including how often a child logs on to the platform, which the school can then monitor. “If a child is not accessing any work, that’s the first potential warning that something is wrong,” says Cox. “But we won’t use technology if it’s not the most applicable way of safeguarding. We might simply decide to phone up a child if that’s the right thing to do.”Regular communication has also been paramount at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust. “All pupils and parents receive regular wellbeing phone calls from a familiar member of staff, with our most vulnerable pupils and parents or carers being spoken to on a daily basis,” says Tapping. “It’s key to ensuring our families feel fully supported and we can ensure we keep our community as safe as possible in their virtual learning world.”And as school leaders begin to contemplate what school life might look like in the future, Redhead is optimistic that the key to staying safe online is having that strong safeguarding culture embedded in the first place – and that hasn’t stopped in lockdown. “I’ve got 200-plus children accessing Teams, and nobody’s misbehaving!” she says. “Nobody’s using it inappropriately, and that’s not because I’m telling them not to do it – that’s around the culture in the school. We shouldn’t be afraid of tech. It’s where our children’s futures are going to be.”Five tips for online security1. Ensure staff are trained in online safety and recognise the security risk posed by phishing emails.2. Choose a cloud-based, secure online learning platform which allows recording of lessons and chats.3. Keep lines of communication with pupils and other agencies open – if necessary, just make a phone call.4. Encourage parents and pupils to use school devices which are already locked down, and loan them out if necessary.5. Think of tech as an enhancement to safeguarding, rather than a barrier to it.Interested in finding out more about safeguarding pupils online?

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

Online teaching has revolutionised the way students are learning today and the current crisis has accelerated the transition to online learning even more.Approximately 1.37 billion students are now learning from home as a result of the lockdown, including more than 2.38 million students studying at UK higher education institutions, and almost 60.2 million teachers are no longer teaching from the classroom.Oliver Fisher, co-founder of Springpod, says that most students have adapted to the rapid change of moving everything online well. “Teachers have always provided other activities alongside the core curriculum but the crisis has forced them to explore the huge amount of resources available online,” he says.Matt Jenner, head of learning at the FutureLearn online platform says that the lockdown has turned remote learning from optional to mandatory. “More schools, colleges and universities are now realising that learning online can offer immense flexibility you’re not tied to location, topics or a timetable,” he notes.Charlie Kilner, a sixth-form student at Millfield school in Somerset, says he has actually found the transition to moving everything online very smooth. “We’re lucky to use devices regularly already so the real transition was just getting used to seeing my teacher over Microsoft Teams.”Kilner, who recently set up a podcast with his media studies teacher, Aimee Coelho, for people to record their stories of life in lockdown, believes the current crisis has fuelled creativity. “Our podcast was made possible through Teams and other online chat forums. We’ve been overwhelmed with the number of submissions from across the globe, from Geneva, Chile and Palau,” he says. “I think lots of great educational content can be made at times like this.”Technology has certainly come a long way in the past decade and can be adapted to suit most subjects, including art. School devices, such as Microsoft Surface, can be used with a Surface Pen to write and sketch. Maia Dalpra, a GCSE student at University Technical College (UTC) Reading in Berkshire, says the online lessons for her GCSE classes are typically held in real time with one teacher answering questions as they come up on the online chat function. This makes her feel just as involved and more like an Open University student than a GCSE one. “I like the fact that I have more independence and that they’re trusting us to organise our time.” The lessons are also recorded so if any student misses one, they can watch it later.Dalpra has gone from having a full school day to three 45-minute lessons each morning online, but feels that this has actually given her an opportunity to develop stronger organisation skills. “I think having more free time is helping me prepare for university. I have the afternoon to study, write essays and reports, and research stuff. If anything, I’m more productive than I was before,” she says.Chloe Godsell, a partnership manager and university admissions expert at Crimson Education, says trust has become more important than ever in the changing relationship between the teacher and student. “Trust between teachers and students plays a much bigger role in online learning than with traditional methods,” she notes. “Teachers are more reliant on students to complete assignments, but similarly, students are reliant on the teachers to deliver the lessons to a different standard.”Dame Kathy August, a former headteacher, director of education and Department for Education senior adviser, says that a teacher’s personality is also hugely important. “Personalities play a big part in the transmission of ideas and values, and I think it can sometimes be harder to transmit that through an online model.”August also believes boys might struggle slightly more than girls with online learning. “As a sweeping generalisation, based on my own teaching experience, I’d say boys might find time management and organisation more difficult. They might be better at getting to grips with the technology but be a little more chaotic.”Dr Lynne Livesey, a deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Central Lancashire, says interactive games can help engage disinterested learners. “Using games in education is just another way to learn, but it can be just as effective. The skill rests with teachers knowing when to use the right tools and then ensuring they’re accessible to everyone.”Daisy Brown, a year-eight student at a high school that gives all students the chance to buy or rent a laptop from year 7 onwards, says one of the things she’s enjoying most about online learning is the educational games. “The teachers use online quizzes and other interactive tech games for design and technology,” she says. “Our touchscreen devices make it easy to answer questions right away and mean the teachers can reply to us straight away too.”There are some things, however, that simply cannot be done during lockdown. Rosie Jacobs, a sixth-form student at Stoke Newington school in London, says: “For my geography A-level I’m supposed to be looking at the area around King’s Cross but that’s not really something I can do at the moment.”That said, being confined to the house doesn’t necessarily stop you learning about the rest of the world, with virtual reality allowing students to journey from the ruins of Greece to the Sahara desert.Jacobs points out that there are some other useful features in online learning, which probably work better for teachers. “One of our teachers mutes us all while she’s carrying out the lesson,” she says. “And that probably makes it more productive for her!”Godsell adds that, ultimately, what began as anxiety-inducing and unfamiliar has become the new normal. “There have been steep learning curves for everyone involved, and many lessons learned along the way. The most important one is that students need to be able to interact and engage with the teacher and each other for real learning to happen,” she says.Five top tips for students:1. Use the online chat function to ask questions as you go. There’s a Raise Hands feature in Teams to signal that you want to speak.2. Try and create a timetable to work from so you have a structure to the day.3. Ask a friend if they will be your study buddy for some collaborative working.4. Remember to take regular breaks throughout the day, and the Do Not Disturb feature in Teams can help with this.5. Use quizzes and interactive games to make things more fun.Interested in finding out more about how to get the most out of online learning, now and in the future?

And they suggest that the vaccine is safe for use in humans.Part of a first-stage trial of 45 people run by the US company Moderna, the results are from a preliminary safety study and do not demonstrate that the treatment will work. But they will be a sign of encouragement for experts and governments desperate for a breakthrough in the battle to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic – widely believed to be impossible without a vaccine.Although both programmes are in the early stages, the findings also appear to put the US research ahead of the UK’s. While the Oxford vaccine was shown in a safety study to protect macaque monkeys against pneumonia, it did not stop infection – which could leave people liable to spread the virus, even if they do not get sick themselves.With the backing of the British government, the Oxford group is partnering with the drug company AstraZeneca to make 30m doses for the UK – if the vaccine works. It is to receive £65.5m to fund its work. Imperial College London, which also has a vaccine under development, has been awarded £18.5m. In the US study, run by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, all eight volunteers made neutralising antibodies which were tested in human cells in the lab and stopped the virus from replicating. The higher the vaccine dose, the more antibodies the volunteer produced.However, as with antibody tests, there will still be questions over whether this response is enough to prevent people from being infected by the virus. This approach does not stimulate another arm of the immune response, from the T-cells. It is also not known whether an antibody response will last.Many different companies and institutions around the world are racing to develop a vaccine in record time, using different approaches. The World Health Organization has a list of 76 contenders. Moderna was the first in the world into clinical trials with an RNA vaccine, which uses a segment of genetic material from the virus itself, called messenger DNA, to provoke the immune system into making antibodies.Imperial College is also developing an RNA vaccine, although its approach is different. Robin Shattock, professor of mucosal infection and immunity, who is leading the Imperial trials, said the Moderna findings were encouraging. “While it will be important to scrutinise the actual data, the reported findings are in line with expectations that vaccine candidates should provide levels of neutralising antibodies that are at least equivalent to convalescent subjects,” he said.“This is a promising start, but efficacy data will be key followed by an ability to scale in a manner that provides global access should this vaccine be successful.”Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, also gave the news a cautious welcome. “Well, it isn’t bad news and there are a number of good points that suggest optimism that this vaccine may work,” he said.Oxford University has published results of safety trials in macaque monkeys. While the vaccine prevented the monkeys from developing pneumonia, it did not block the virus from infecting the animals.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology, University of Nottingham, said that the Oxford results were encouraging in that they prevented serious illness, but that if the vaccine works the same way in humans, it may not prevent the spread of disease.“If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected, shed large amounts of virus which could potentially spread to others in the community,” he said.“If the most vulnerable people aren’t protected by the vaccine to the same degree, then this will put them at risk. Therefore, vaccine efficacy in vulnerable populations and the potential for virus shedding in vaccinated people needs very careful monitoring.”Moderna has so far only released results for the youngest group of volunteers. It intends to press ahead to the next stage of human trials involving 600 people shortly, with a much bigger trial involving thousands set to begin in July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde8fa0726459cda7c9ac5747fc2a4749f804070/0_124_3120_1873/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6893d3290628b86e5b816df87d09aaf","title":"my working week see children waiting longer adopted coronavirus","story":"Adoption assessments are continuing despite the lockdown but the pandemic has thrown up all sorts of challenges As another week in lockdown begins, I attend a virtual meeting with colleagues to discuss the impact of Covid-19 on care planning for children. There is a lot of uncertainty about the logistical challenges of moving children to their prospective adoptive family at this time, as well as worries about children waiting longer in foster care.I complete a virtual visit to a five-month-old baby placed with carers just before the lockdown. They will adopt this child if the judge agrees. The final hearing has now been postponed until June when it would have concluded otherwise in April. The carers are prepared to manage legal uncertainty, but coronavirus was not anything we could have foreseen. They are sad to not be able to enjoy baby groups with their child and are missing friends and family.I speak to a social worker to gather health information about a child. I am relieved when she answers the phone, but she sounds overwhelmed. I see the effects of austerity, cuts to services and high workloads on social workers every day in this job, and how these have increased exponentially since Covid-19 struck. I worry about the wellbeing of these key workers. At this time of national emergency, home is not a safe haven for many children.Adoption assessments are continuing despite lockdown, and today I set up a virtual meeting with a couple in the first stage of the assessment to discuss health information that may impact whether they are able to adopt at all. The meeting is difficult as I cannot guarantee they will be deemed fit to adopt based on the information that has come to light. It is difficult to share bad news with applicants at the best of times, but harder when you can’t be with them in person.We are still getting enquiries from people interested in adopting and today I take a call from a single prospective adopter of black Caribbean descent. It is not the right time to proceed as she plans to move house but I am keen to continue a dialogue with her due to the high numbers of BAME children waiting for adoptive families. I invite her to attend a virtual meeting with a social worker in a few weeks’ time. As we process adoption enquiries, we now have to take into account the implications of the pandemic for job security. I attend a virtual looked after child review for a six-year-old who was placed with his adoptive family a year ago. He was finally enjoying school before the lockdown he’d made friends and was being supported to improve his speech and language skills. Now his routine has changed, and his behaviour has deteriorated. This is tough for his adoptive family, who are also trying to work from home. Adoptive parents I am working with have recently learned their son’s birth mother has had another baby. We have a virtual meeting to discuss whether they could consider adopting this sibling. It’s a very difficult decision for the couple, and they ultimately decide against putting themselves forward. They feel guilty and sad, but I think it is the right choice. I’m glad it’s Friday and am looking forward to spending time in the garden. I am fortunate to have one and know it will help me relax after a busy week, but I miss the freedom of being able to see my own friends and family, and hope the lockdown can end soon.The writer is an adoption social worker at Coram.

In my lifetime in Rome, I’ve experienced the city almost empty on a few occasions: usually late-night and early-morning walks home, but nothing like the past two months.On 11 March, Rome was silenced. Doors were closed, residents stayed inside and the pace of a frenetic city slowed to that of a faint beat. For 54 days there was no traffic, no street-side chatter and no tourists. The only movement was that of the delivery bikes and scooters passing in the streets below the apartment.On 4 May, when the centro storico reopened, we returned to our city. The oval-shaped Piazza Navona became a jogging track, Piazza della Rotonda turned into a great training ground for fledgling cyclists and Corso Vittorio Emanuele II was commandeered by skateboarders. For two weeks, we lived in our own utopia – it was just us and Rome. Even the former golden boy of Italian football, Roma’s Francesco Totti, and wife Ilary, enjoyed the empty streets. As of 18 May, Italy’s bars, restaurants, shops and beauty salons could open for business. So, at 10 am, I walk out of my palazzo in Rome’s historic centre and into a street scene that could be any typical Monday morning: couriers run along the road, handfuls of people enter and exit the tram, and there is a long line for the post office.I call my cousin Giovanna who lives in Prati, a nearby neighbourhood.“It’s weird. It feels like we’re back to normal. Everyone’s at the bar downstairs all baci abbracci (kisses and hugs) but with masks on,” I tell her.I bike to my local market. On via dei Giubbonari, shopkeepers are setting up and residents are walking around. People sit, socially distanced, at the tables of an outdoor cafe. Mostly everyone is wearing a masks. Reality sets in by the time I arrive at Campo de’ Fiori where there are only a handful of vendors, far fewer than there usually are.Pippo and Anastasia Nicosia, flower vendors, came back to Campo on 4 May – and were here this morning at 7am. “It’s much quieter, less people. But we’ve been given a chance to see a Rome that perhaps we lost for a while,” Anastasia says. “Will it pick up? We need to wait before we have an idea what reality will be like … before we have equilibrio.”She is talking about balance, because right now there is none. The main streets of Rome, such as Via del Corso and Via dei Condotti, are misleadingly busy. There are even buskers, including Luiza Constantin, but shoppers are few. On Via dei Condotti, I bump into Arthur, who came out to be the first to enjoy the boutiques before the return of the crowds. I like his positivity.At Ciampini Caffè, on Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina, I smile when I see that about half of its outdoor tables have customers. “I think people are cautious,” says waiter Vicenzo Macri, “We just need to wait a few weeks to see what things will be like. And I have hope that they will be better.”On side streets, shopkeepers anxiously await patrons but other shops are closed, protesting against the government, the pandemic and the lack of clear-cut protocols. Some restaurants will open, like Luciano Cucina - who has set up distinct dining shifts – but others have opted to remain shuttered while they plan a strategy for survival.Only my local cycle shop, Cicli di Bartolomei, on Piazza di Santa Caterina della Rota, seems to be kicking into a higher gear at reopening – and rightfully so. Rome is finally attempting to make good on its promise to turn the city into a bike-friendly one, with economic assistance for those who buy bicycles, push- and electric scooters and e-bikes. Alessandro di Bartolomei tells me his retired mother has had to come in to the shop and help out, as it has been so busy since reopening on 4 May.I make my way home, meandering the side streets. At the Pantheon, a woman takes the perfect Instagram photo of her mother, two businessmen walk quickly across the square and a man enters a sandwich shop, all set to a melodic, live soundtrack of birds chirping. It feels like Ferragosto, August 15, AKA Rome’s beautiful full stop.Rome is trying to find her equilibrio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cb3474d7b8d578b2aa04f45d719a78050214aba/3_0_4851_2913/master/4851.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c184d87bfefe4c6b3131580e7d9bf384","title":"us senate democrats elections 2020","story":"The electoral map does not favor Republicans and the pandemic has helped put them on defense in states they once thought safeJust three months ago, centrist Democrats were panicking. After strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders appeared poised to sail away with the nomination for president. Some in the party feared the self-identified democratic socialist would wreak havoc down the ballot.“If Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,” the Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Joe Biden’s campaign, said on a February conference call. “We would not get the Senate back.”The world looks different now – and so does the Senate map. With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs.Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can’t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat.But Jones’s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.“Over the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I’d say Democratic prospects in some of these inidual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.“The overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.”Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party’s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia.“A lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina … would have been much harder,” said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the Cook Political Report.Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana. The state’s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, launched his Senate campaign in March. A recent poll showed him leading the Republican incumbent, Steve Daines, by seven points, even though Trump carried Montana by 20 in 2016.“I think the Democrats have done a better job of putting more races in play than the Republicans have,” Kondik said, “although Republicans are just defending many more seats.”Democratic candidates have seen better fundraising numbers, which party strategists say is a reflection of grassroots energy. For example, in Maine, in the first quarter of this year, Sara Gideon raised nearly three times as much money as the Republican senator Susan Collins.Incumbent Republicans face the same challenge as the president: the financial devastation caused by the pandemic has robbed them of their best talking point – the strength of the US economy. As the unemployment rate climbs and many Americans lose health coverage, Democratic strategists are quick to point out that the administration has stayed in a lawsuit from Republican state attorneys general which seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act.“Senate Republicans, right now, today, support a lawsuit that could toss out critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions,” said Benjamin Ray, senior director of campaign communications for the Democratic group Emily’s List.“It might sound unconscionable to kick people that have gotten sick in a global pandemic off of their health insurance, but it’s what incumbent Republicans want.”Democratic strategists insist Republicans are also suffering as a result of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis and his party’s refusal to criticize him for it.Last month, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, circulated a 57-page memo which instructed candidates: “Don’t defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban – attack China.”After the Trump campaign lashed out, the committee was forced to backtrack, saying there was “no daylight between the NRSC and President Trump”.The NRSC did not offer a comment to the .Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said: “Republican senators have completely tied themselves to the president, and now they’re on the hook and own the failed coronavirus response.”With a majority of Americans expressing disapproval of Trump’s handling of the crisis, Democrats say Senate Republicans will suffer the consequences in November.“It is very clear what the Republican agenda is,” Kalla said. “I don’t think voters are going to forget it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24bca06caf266e6447dc3360602d291c37d34402/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce761cc227cb2a224a81d9148060496","title":"people who are shielding how do you feel about the new lockdown rules","story":"As restrictions ease for people who are not subject to health conditions, do you feel forgotten about, isolated or cut off?The UK government has set out its plan to leave lockdown, but the changes will not affect everyone equally.

But we can only allow three people inside at a time, so for now we’ll only be serving snacks and drinks at the bar, and doing food for takeaway.”But while the bars enjoyed a flurry of customers, the first day back for restaurants was more subdued, with many still closed as they prepare their premises for reopening.“We had around six customers over lunchtime,” said Chiara Gargioli of Armando al Pantheon, a popular, family-run trattoria in Rome’s historic centre. “A small number, but it was OK. They were all people who we know.”Italy was the first country in Europe to enforce a nationwide lockdown and is gradually emerging from it. Since 4 May, when manufacturing resumed, parks reopened and people were allowed to visit relatives and partners, there has been a sustained fall in the coronavirus death and contagion rate.As part of the ongoing phase two, which has been called “living with the virus”, civil liberties now include being able to travel freely within inidual regions and to see friends. Restrictions on inter-regional travel will be lifted from 3 June.But while people are venturing out more and businesses can trade again, with the virus still circulating, for the most part they are doing so cautiously.Along Orvieto’s main thoroughfare only one restaurant, Gallo d’Oro, opened for lunch, and the only customer was the . Other restaurants are expected to follow suit later this week. Owners need to ensure that tables are at least 1 metre apart and are disinfected between sittings. Customers must pre-book and wear masks as they enter a restaurant and whenever they leave their tables. Staff must wear masks and gloves at all times. Hand disinfectant and plastic gloves are available for customers outside Gallo d’Oro before they enter.“After all this time indoors, we just wanted to try and get going again and regain some sort of normality, even though our expectations were not high,” said Titiana Corbi, who manages the restaurant. “A few people have called out of curiosity, but we are yet to take any bookings.”Italians may be hesitant about eating out, but they were keen to get back the hairdresser. Anna Paciaccone, who runs a salon a short walk away from Gallo d’Oro, has been busy since she opened. “People booked before today and had to specify exactly what they wanted over the phone.

An implementation date has not yet been announced.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are to present a joint plan to spur EU recovery after weeks of debate over how to deploy billions of euros needed to quickly end a painful recession.Continental European nations are just beginning to emerge from lockdowns that have taken a huge bite out of their economies and raised the prospects of recessions that could last for months.The European Union may give an initial approval for sale of the drug remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment, the head of its medicines agency says, fast-tracking the drug to market amid tight global competition for resources.The US, which has angered the EU with aggressive tactics in a procurement race, has yet to issue a similar approval for the drug. Demand for it has been growing as there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines.The pandemic should serve as a wake-up call to a world that must be more united, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, says.Guterres says Covid-19 is the “greatest challenge of our age” and has demonstrated the world’s fragility, as nations go their own way. He adds that the crisis is an opportunity to rebuild a better world, but questions whether countries are up to it.Monday’s overnight death toll in Spain is 59, the lowest figure in two months, the country’s government says. The cumulative death toll rises to 27,709, while the number of confirmed cases increases to 231,606 from 231,350 the previous day, according to health ministry figures.UK government ministers may be undermining public trust in science in the way they talk about it when defending their decisions, a leading scientist and broadcaster warns.Prof Brian Cox says he is particularly concerned about ministers saying they are just “following the science”. The Royal Society professor for public engagement with science says the “politicisation of science or scientific advice might deliver some short-term political advantages … But, this will have, I think, serious long-term consequences because it undermines public trust in science.”Visitors are allowed to return to Saint Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican after more than two months of lockdown.

Footage posted on social media appeared to show Government of National Accord (GNA) forces driving down runways at the base unhindered.Haftar planned to take Tripoli in a lightning operation in April 2019, but his forces have been mired in fighting ever since. Many of their attacks have been launched from al-Watiya.His retreat, following other recent military reverses, will force those foreign capitals that back him to review the viability of his plan to overthrow the UN-recognised GNA, which is based in Tripoli.GNA forces have been mounting strikes against the airbase for weeks, including its supply lines, but over the weekend stepped up the assault by destroying its Russian-made Pantsir air defence system. The airbase had been in Haftar’s hands since 2014.Turkey, in defiance of a UN arms embargo, signed a treaty with the GNA in November last year, and, in return for Libyan permission to access Mediterranean gas fields, has been supplying military support to the GNA. The bilateral treaty has been sharply criticised by Greece as being in breach of international law and in violation of Greek sovereignty.The growing Turkish support for the GNA, driven by Ankara’s desire to secure its energy supplies and extend its access to Mediterranean gas fields, has included the supply of both drones and Syrian mercenary forces.Ankara argues the GNA remains by law the UN-recognised government and says its actions only redress the imbalance caused by the supply of arms and mercenaries to Haftar by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. France also unofficially backs Haftar, regarding him as a bulwark against terrorism in the Sahel.The second air base in the west, Mitiga, is also run by the GNA and Haftar now has no air base in west Libya. Increasingly many of these assaults are killing civilians and destroying hospital facilities at a time when the country is trying to control a coronavirus outbreak. More than 1,000 have been killed in the year-long battle for Tripoli.The concern for France and the UAE is that it is possible al-Watiya airfield will become a strategic asset for Turkey, especially if it takes an interest in the country’s southern oilfields. The capture will also free up GNA troops to put pressure on Haftar’s forces south of Tripoli.Haftar remains in controls of the oil terminals in the east, and has blocked the export of Libyan oil, the lifeblood of the economy. He also appears to have seen off an attempt last month to weaken him politically by iding him from the leaders of the house of representatives, the parliament based in the east.The European Union, concerned by migration from Libya to the EU’s southern flank, has just launched a naval blockade of the Mediterranean, codenamed Operation Irini, in an effort to enforce a UN arms embargo. The operation’s structure and composition has been criticised by the GNA and Turkey.The GNA accused the EU mission of bias since it contains ships from Greece and France, the two EU countries most opposed to Turkey’s involvement in Libya.The GNA foreign ministry also claims that because the focus is on enforcing the arms embargo by sea, Haftar’s supplies by air and land are excluded from EU attention.On Friday the Turkish minister of defence, Hulusi Akar, questioned the legality of Operation Irini, arguing it had been launched without consultation with Nato, the UN or the GNA itself.The EU had been in the diplomatic lead trying to negotiate a ceasefire and political agreement between Haftar’s forces based in the east and the GNA forces in the west, but talks staged in Berlin in January foundered, leading to the resignation of the UN special envoy for Libya in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dea5942c2a1bbfb9f9cfa415ecad0e95b3c7088/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a22361bee561ca9c1464d31054595abb","title":"how a facebook group has helped those bereaved by coronavirus","story":"Yellow Hearts To Remember was set up by David Gompertz to do justice to the scale of loss When she walked out of Harrogate hospital where her 58-year-old husband Leo had just died after contracting Covid-19, Joanne Ciavarella said she had never felt more alone in the world.“I wasn’t allowed anyone else with me. I had to walk out that hospital and drive home on my own knowing that my husband had just died,” she said. “I don’t know how my legs carried me.”She then had to recover from the virus herself at home, self-isolating with her 13-year-old son and unable to see her friends or her parents, who are in their 70s. So when she came across the Yellow Hearts To Remember Facebook group, it became a lifeline.“I was absolutely desperate for that contact and to know that other people were having the same experiences, and the grief that I was going through alone was normal to some extent,” she said. “I’ve had so many Facebook messages from people I don’t even know saying: ‘We’re in the same boat.’”The group was set up by David Gompertz, 83, with help from his family, after losing his wife, Sheila, to the virus. He felt the government’s daily death toll figure didn’t do justice to the scale of the loss from Covid-19, and wanted to create a group encouraging the bereaved to pin yellow hearts in their window, as a symbol of remembrance.But since the group’s creation a couple of weeks ago, it has grown into something much more – a warm and welcoming community of thousands sharing stories and pictures of lost loved ones.“I just do two or three minutes and weep, because the people on there are all sizes and shapes, ethnic groups and ages. It’s just devastating,” Gompertz said. “And we don’t own it anymore. That Facebook page is owned by all those people who posted.” One of those is Charlotte Compton, whose dad, 91-year-old James Jones, died in April after contracting coronavirus.Like many she faced the difficulty of organising a funeral and having to choose which family members were able to attend.“The toughest thing for me was, at the funeral, not being able to hug my family,” she said. “A social media platform is no substitute for that at all, but it’s comforting to have some kind of virtual love from people you don’t even know but who understand everything that you’re going through.”She also came across another Facebook group which encourages people to light a candle in their window at 8pm every Sunday to remember those who have died.“It sounds quite small, but I really found it very comforting,” she said. “I felt calm and peaceful because I just felt everybody who is in a similar situation can feel a sense of belonging and togetherness, some unity which somehow makes grief more bearable.”While digital tributes are offering some solace to people grieving for coronavirus victims, families are now calling for a more permanent tribute. Ciavarella has written to Boris Johnson asking for his support in planting a forest of trees, one for each victim of the virus, as a lasting memorial."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/666e8a11be2bbc5d9489af4f21779fcd804ff0a1/0_227_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a01695a3b34e8dd07d3fad2c388df3f","title":"monica lewinsky among thousands to share last normal photo","story":"UK journalist Robyn Vinter gets thousands of replies after asking people to share images of life before lockdownRobyn Vinter knew something was happening when she saw a reply from Monica Lewinsky. Vinter, a Leeds-based journalist, had sent a Saturday morning tweet which contained a simple request: “I would like to see the last normal pic on your phone.”Within hours she had thousands of replies, including one from the woman best known for her part in a political scandal involving the former US president Bill Clinton.“I spotted Jon Ronson had replied, and a couple more fairly high-profile people and then I noticed Monica Lewinsky had,” said Vinter. “I thought: that’s weird, how did she find my little tweet out of nowhere? Then I saw there were thousands of replies.”Vinter’s simple tweet soon took on a life of its own, with almost 8,000 replies, revealing people’s desire for a glimpse of life before lockdown. The hashtag #lastnormalphoto began trending this weekend, with people from across the globe posting the last picture they took before the lockdown measures brought normal life to an end in March.Pictures range from mundane snapshots of life, such as parents and children embarking on their final school run before classrooms were closed, to more joyous occasions including birthday parties with people hugging and chatting in groups – with barely 2cm between them let alone 2 metres – before lockdown made physical distancing mandatory.There’s a shot from the Champions League tie between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid on 11 March, while several people sent images from meet-ups with elderly relatives. Lewinsky sent a picture of a bouquet of flowers she had received.“There are a lot of things that people would have chosen to do if they knew it was coming. It’s a frozen moment in time, I suppose,” said Vinter.Originally inspired by a BBC article, which asked for readers to send photographs, the hashtag is the latest photo callout to become popular on social media. Others include Covid-19 specific themes (#beforesocialdistancing, #sociallydistanced, #nosocialdistancinghere), the nostalgic (#happiertimes, #untilnexttime, #misstheolddays) and the exasperated (#whenwillitend, #2020cancelled).Vinter, who works for the Yorkshire Post and founded the Overtake news site, says there is a question mark over whether the pictures are actually the last ones taken before lockdown, or the most social-media-friendly option.“You could tell some of them were curated,” she said. “It wasn’t actually their last normal picture. It was one they had chosen because it was cool or they thought it made them look good. So there’s an element of narcissism involved.”Vinter puts the popularity of the hashtag down to a combination of that narcissism and nostalgia, as people scroll through their phones and pick out a snapshot of their former life. “It’s nice for people to reflect on what they were doing especially because life changed so quickly,” she says. “People had a feeling that something was going to happen, but no one knew the necessary extreme it would go to.”Vinter’s own entry to the hashtag was of her in a charity shop as she sized up a mirror that she was considering buying. “There was a weird 1970s mirror that I liked, so I’d just taken a picture of it. I wanted to have a think about it and imagine where it might go in my house and then go back for it,” she said.“Obviously the charity shop is shut, but I’m hoping it’s still there and no one has got to it in the meantime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef010b60dff4602cdd6d13006c6836058808cd90/0_0_6144_3688/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b3c72f7ebf8cb1307fbf8b1ef66b2a","title":"more than 1800 private planes landed in uk during covid 19 lockdown","story":"Figure includes privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flightsAt least 1,800 private aircraft landed in the UK during lockdown, official figures have shown, with no requirement for arriving passengers to provide contact details for purposes of tracking the spread of coronavirus.In response to a question from the Conservative peer Baroness Anelay of St Johns, the Home Office said that between 17 March and 14 April, 1,812 private aircraft flights landed at airports in the UK.The figure include privately owned planes, business jets, cargo aircraft and military flights. A breakdown was not provided.In the written answer, the Home Office minister, Baroness Williams of Trafford, said: “There is no Public Health England requirement to record contact details for arriving or departing passengers for Covid-19 purposes.”The UK’s border policy before and during the lockdown is facing increased scrutiny. The government previously revealed that just 273 out of the 18.1 million people who entered the UK in the three months prior to the coronavirus lockdown were formally quarantined.Since 13 March, government policy has been to inform passengers arriving at the border of the measures in place in the UK through posters, screens and leaflets. There has been no enforced quarantine or thermal screening.On 10 May, Boris Johnson said that air passengers arriving in the UK would soon be required to self-isolate. It is now understood that this will also apply to land and sea arrivals.Experts have questioned the scientific basis behind introducing such a policy at this stage in the pandemic and the travel and tourism industry has warned of dire consequences for the sector if such a policy is pursued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d9f1dd687dc1f279750a27d4c18d4cc9061fcd5/0_105_4922_2954/master/4922.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd1d4d6f1177c04ce54bd362bc51589","title":"ofcom christian tv network covid 19 nigeria coronavirus","story":"LoveWorld News broadcast ‘potentially harmful statements’ about coronavirusA Christian television channel founded by a Lagos-based megachurch pastor has been sanctioned by Ofcom for airing “potentially harmful statements” about the Covid-19 pandemic, including a baseless conspiracy that the virus is linked to the rollout of 5G phone networks.Programmes aired in early April on the LoveWorld Television Ministry, which broadcasts on satellite around the world, claimed there was a “global cover-up” over 5G networks being the cause of the pandemic.The British regulator said the programme also echoed claims from US president Donald Trump that an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, was a cure for the virus. The statements in April drew mass international criticism, with trials for the drug still inconclusive.“LoveWorld News featured potentially harmful statements about the coronavirus pandemic and adequate protection was not provided to viewers,” a statement from Ofcom said.“We have imposed a sanction on the broadcaster, requiring it to broadcast statements of our findings. We are considering whether to impose any further sanction,” the statement added.Christian Oyakhilome, a Nigerian pastor, founded the network’s associated church, Christ Embassy, in Lagos in 1987. The church has at least 90 branches in the UK and an estimated 13 million followers around the world.A news programme on LoveWorld, aired from South Africa on 7 April, was titled: “Why is 5G linked to Covid-19?” and claimed the technology was fuelling an outbreak of the virus.“With the classification of a weapon, 5G technology is very dangerous. When it comes into contact with a human body it can provide some poisons to the cells … This shows that what’s killing people, it’s not coronavirus, but 5G,” a presenter on the programme said.UK-based presenters on LoveWorld shows also reported on footage from a Fox News interview with a woman who claimed to have recovered from Covid-19 following the use of hydroxychloroquine. A presenter described the development as “good news” according to the regulator.Oyakhilome has been critical of the lockdown measures that have forced places of worship to close around the world, and has himself propagated conspiracy theories about the virus.About 30,000 people attend his main branch in Lagos, the Nigerian coastal metropolis where a lockdown has been imposed since the end of March.In sermons in recent weeks, Oyakhilome has regularly cast doubt on the need for lockdowns, describing them and the wearing of protective face masks as unscientific.In one LoveWorld programme, he pointed to an image showing a link between 5G and the virus, saying: “This is real. The power is so much that plants that were close to the cells that were already set up in certain streets burnt.”Last year Christ Embassy was condemned by the UK’s charity watchdog, which found that there had been “serious misconduct” in the way that it was run. The Charity Commission found that Christ Embassy had made a large number of “informal grants and payments”, including more than £1.2m to LoveWorld TV between 2009-2011.Last month, Ofcom confirmed it was actively monitoring television and radio stations that might be broadcasting potentially harmful views about the causes and origins of Covid-19 that have “the potential to undermine people’s trust in the advice of mainstream sources of information” during the crisis.False claims that coronavirus is linked to 5G have spread widely around the world in recent months on several social media platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80405a384cbc8291ba63105c6a4209cb4db5ea6d/0_111_555_333/master/555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d422dc13abc36a449b73753d638b885","title":"syrian tv drama interview with mr adam photo rehab al alawi","story":"An Interview With Mr Adam sparks revulsion by using picture of Rehab al-AlawiA new Ramadan television series in Syria has been met with revulsion by the opposition and diaspora community after a photograph of a 24-year-old torture victim who died in a regime prison was used to represent a fictional murdered woman.In the detective drama An Interview With Mr Adam, an Egyptian woman who was pregnant by her rich employer’s son is apparently murdered by her lover. While the woman is played by an actor in flashbacks, in one scene when an investigator prints out a photograph of the body, the picture actually belongs to Rehab al-Alawi, whose death in a notorious Syrian jail was confirmed in 2014.“The shock and sense of disturbance has been universal,” said Mai el-Sadany, legal and judicial director at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.“Presenting a known Syrian torture victim as if she is an unknown non-Syrian victim of crime in a fictional drama is, at best, disturbingly callous, and at worst a potentially intentional re-traumatisation of victims and an attempted rewriting of the regime’s history and complicity in torture.”Rehab al-Alawi, from Deir ez-Zor, one of the first cities in Syria to see anti-Assad protests in the 2011 Arab spring, was studying civil engineering in Damascus when the uprising began. She became even more committed to the revolution after her elder brother Asem was disappeared and killed by Bashar al-Assad’s forces later that year.Alawi herself was arrested in January 2013. A former cellmate later told her mother and siblings she had been subjected to interrogations and torture for around two hours a day and would come back crying and shaking with fear.“We did our best to save her life, but we failed,” said Rehab’s brother Hamza, who now lives in Saudi Arabia. “In total we paid around $150,000 (£121,000) to try and secure Rehab’s release … We sent messages and money to several military officers who promised they would smuggle her to Lebanon.“They told us she was safe but they could not give us any proof. We knew later they took our money and lied.”The family found out Alawi was dead when her picture surfaced among the thousands of photographs of killed political prisoners released by a dissident military police photographer in 2014, in what came to be known as the Caesar report.In the photograph of Alawi’s body from the Caesar cache, her headscarf has slipped off, revealing red marks on her chest, and the rest of her black clothing is covered in dust. Two numbers are taped across her forehead: one is a reference number for the branch of the security services responsible for her detention and the other is a falsified document number recording her death in a military hospital – both unique markers of the Syrian prison system.Despite an outpouring of anger on social media and news coverage in several Arabic-language outlets, neither the director, Fadi Selim, nor the production company, Phoenix Group, have addressed the use of Alawi’s photograph. Phoenix Group and Abu Dhabi TV, which airs the series across the region, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Encouraged by the first trial of former regime officers connected to the Caesar files, which began in Germany last month, Alawi’s Munich-based uncle Khalid al-Alawi said he was considering suing An Interview With Mr Adam’s director and production company in Germany’s courts over the use of his niece’s photograph.“Rehab’s death was heartbreaking, but the most shocking thing was seeing her picture in the series,” he said. “We all know that Assad is part of everything in Syria: even movies and sports represent the regime. They killed her and now they are changing the facts and falsifying history.”Syrian television shows have channelled several inflammatory regime narratives since the conflict broke out: peaceful protesters as well as armed opposition members are often referred to as terrorists, and a Ramadan drama from last year mocked victims of chemical weapons attacks by suggesting that rescue teams in rebel-held areas had staged the events.Revealing the fates of around 120,000 people who have disappeared in Assad’s prisons is one of the biggest hurdles in sporadic international talks to end Syria’s war, now in their 10th year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab8555ba1496271f03db96166d075da6e80ace9/327_263_3180_1909/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8eb1c86bbbfbb79244c32105115d43d","title":"pitch perfect the deserted playing fields of cologne in pictures","story":"As Germany’s Bundesliga becomes the world’s first major football league to resume during the coronavirus pandemic, Mika Volkmann’s drone photographs suggest the amateur game in Cologne still has some way to go"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52b082ac3107a81c921ea20ee0899b7d92714020/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ae15bd49cb053114cca0155953fbd82","title":"coronavirus live news record daily cases in south africa as india extends lockdown","story":"Local authorities across Mexico have resisted President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s call to lift emergency measures in municipalities without confirmed cases, warning that the pandemic is far from over.Mexico has registered nearly 50,000 cases and more than 5,000 deaths, and its testing rate ranks among the lowest in Latin America, with just 0.4 tests per 1,000 people.But, on Monday, approximately 300 municipalities throughout the country – called “municipalities of hope” – were given the green light to restart economic activities and lift sheltering-in-place recommendations. Similar measures are scheduled to start 1 June in the rest of the country, while classes will resume the same day.

She said researchers aim to publish results on a rolling basis.The president of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde has also welcomed the proposed €500bn recovery fund, saying it would bring much-needed relief to the worst-hit EU countries.“The Franco-German proposals are ambitious, targeted and welcome,” Lagarde said in a joint interview with four European newspapers, after announcement of the plan sent the euro higher and reduced Italian bond yields.The proposals “open the way for long-term borrowing by the European Commission and above all allow significant direct budgetary aid to the member states worst affected by the crisis”, Lagarde told the newspapers Les Echos, Handelsblatt, Corriere della Sera and El Mundo.Sudan has extended a lockdown of the state of Khartoum by an additional two weeks from Tuesday, the state news agency has reported.

It also said that “a number of his office staff and bodyguards” had also tested positive.France’s highest administrative court has ruled that the government must lift a blanket ban on meetings at places of worship imposed as part of measures to combat the epidemic, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.After receiving complaints from several iniduals and associations, the Council of State said that such a ban on freedom of worship caused “a damage that is serious and manifestly illegal”.It told the government to lift the ban within the next eight days.The latest government decree bans all gatherings in places of worship, even after the lockdown was eased from 11 May. Funerals are excepted and are limited to 20 people.But the Council of State ruled this ban was “disproportionate in nature.”It remains to be seen what move the government will take to respect the decision while retaining a safe environment in churches, mosques and other places of worship.Bruno Retailleau, who leads the right-wing Republicans in the French upper house, the Sénat, said the decision was “good news for religious freedom, which is a fundamental right”.In the UK, the opposition Labour party has expressed concern at lockdown measures being eased at the start of June after ministers conceded that a key part of the test-and-trace regime to contain new outbreaks, a phone app, will not be ready for weeks.The health secretary Matt Hancock announced that anyone over the age of five with symptoms would be eligible for a test. The news is expected to lead to a surge in people visiting the gov.uk website to book home test kits or drive-through appointments.Until now, eligibility was limited to certain groups including key workers, those aged over 65 years, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.But there are fresh worries about the NHS phone app, which is designed to be downloaded by millions to curb the spread of Covid-19, as the organisation representing local public health leaders said it was “disappointed” at the level of government engagement on the issue.The Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg and her colleagues have filmed a physically distanced dance for the country’s Constitution Day. It was aired on 17 May on the government-owned broadcaster NRK.Mass gatherings and parades are not permitted at least until mid-June to try and slow the spread of the virus.Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez has welcomed the €500bn (£447bn) recovery fund proposed by France and Germany to help regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic.My colleague Kevin Rawlinson will be taking you through the next few hours of this blog.

Some restrictions have been eased but the country is still not open for foreign tourism and Czechs are required to present a negative coronavirus test upon return or go into quarantine.Discussions have been underway to open borders with neighbours such as Austria and Slovakia, which have also taken steps to relax their border regimes, Reuters reports.Vojtech said he had proposed that, as of 8 June, travel to and from a list of risky countries – to be determined but currently likely to include Spain, Italy or France – would be subject to the current requirements, while others deemed safe – such as Austria, Slovakia or Croatia – would be exempt.The list of risky countries would be updated continuously, he added. The prime minister, Andrej Babis, said last week that borders with Slovakia and Austria could be fully opened from 8 June.Separately, the foreign minister Tomas Petricek said today that borders with all neighbouring states – Poland, Germany, Austria and Slovakia – could be open by mid-June, the news agency CTK reported. The foreign ministry also said Czech tourists may be allowed to travel to Greece from July.Here are synopses of the biggest stories from the last few hours:"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA WireOutdoor gatherings of up to six people who do not share a household are to be permitted in the North after the Northern Executive approved the relaxation of some coronavirus restrictions. Churches will be allowed to open for inidual prayer, and golf courses will also reopen. Drive-in religious services, cinemas, concerts and live theatre performances are also permitted, providing all those attending stay in their vehicles. Making the announcement at the Executive’s daily press briefing on Monday, the first minister, Arlene Foster, said the decision to further relax restrictions had been made according to the scientific and medical advice, and was dependent on venues and iniduals following guidelines on social distancing and hygiene. Outdoor activities “where social distancing can occur and people do not touch shared hard surfaces can also proceed,” Ms Foster said. The measures will come into force as soon as the regulations can be introduced by the North’s health minister, which the first minister said she hoped would be later on Monday. Each of the moves was outlined in step one of the Executive’s five-stage plan for exiting lockdown, which was published last week. However the Executive did not give the go-ahead for people to meet indoors with relatives who live in other households, which is also included in the first stage. “We understand that’s going to disappoint some of you,” Ms Foster said, “but we would ask you to remain patient and trust that this Executive, informed by the most up-to-date scientific and medical advice, is in the best position to guide you when it’s safe to do so. “It’s a matter we will constantly review, and I give you that commitment.” Northern Ireland recorded six further coronavirus-related deaths on Monday, according to the Department of Health (DoH). It brings the total number of fatalities in the North to 482. An additional 659 iniduals were tested in the most recent 24-hour period, resulting in an additional 16 confirmed cases of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. A total of 4,401 positive cases have been confirmed in the North, and 39,918 people have been tested. As of Monday there were 71 active outbreaks in care homes. The figures released daily by the DoH cover mainly deaths in hospitals, and do not include fatalities in care homes and hospices. Statistics released on Friday by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), which cover deaths in all settings, showed that a total of 599 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in Northern Ireland up to May 8th. The Bishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor, “warmly welcomed” the decision to reopen places of worship for private prayer. “I know it will bring tremendous consolation to all people of faith throughout the North of Ireland,” he said. He said churches within the Diocese would reopen following a full risk assessment and according to the capacity of each parish to do so “safely and in a accordance with public health guidance and best practice.” The North began its exit from lockdown on Monday. Garden centres and recycling facilities reopened, with queues at many venues, and employees returned to work on construction sites were social distancing could be facilitated. Angling also resumed, and marriages were permitted in the case of a terminal medical diagnosis. The relaxation of the regulations, Ms Foster said, had been made possible by the “vast majority” of people following public health advice. “They have been hard-won freedoms,” she said, “and it is vital that when you exercise those freedoms that you do it in a way that does not put anyone else’s safety at risk.”The deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill, said the approach to exiting lockdown would be “measured and cautious” but they wanted to give people “some hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.“We will get there,” she said, “and we’ll get there quicker when we all keep doing what we’re doing and staying apart.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256202.1589801317!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reopening q a what can i do today that i couldn t do yesterday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNewlands Home and Garden Centre, Newlands Cross, Dublin, where among the many to reopen as part of first phase of the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions on Monday. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSo what is changing today?The Government is permitting people to have greater interaction with each other and allow certain businesses to reopen but is still encouraging people to observe physical distancing by staying two metres apart, and continue to show good cough and sneeze etiquette and to wash hands regularly for at least 20 seconds.Are restrictions being eased on meeting people?Yes. Up to four people, either family or friends, who don’t live together can meet but only outdoors and while keeping at least two metres apart. So does this mean I should go ahead and meet family and friends?Not necessarily. Public health officials are still encouraging people to say at home and try to avoid visiting family and friends during this first phase of reopening. Does it have to be the same four people each time?No, it can be four different people each time and there are no restrictions on where you can meet them, though the location has to be within five kilometres of all four people’s homes. Dr Cillian de Gascun, chairman of the expert advisory group to the Department of Health’s public health emergency team, has advised not to meet more than one social group of four people in a day and to restrict interactions to a small circle of family and friends for at least three weeks.So how long are people permitted to stay together?The advice is not to spend longer than 15 minutes in close contact with others in addition to stay at least two metres apart, but if people spend longer in each other’s company they are advised to stay away from one another.Could I meet in someone’s back garden?There is a risk in meeting in a back garden if visitors were to use kitchen or bathroom facilities as this could leave to a further spread of the virus. People should not use cups, glasses, plates or cutlery from another person’s home as this could transmit the virus.Should I wear a face mask?The Government is recommending that “face coverings” be worn in public places such as shops and on busy public transport where there is a higher risk of coming into contact with others where physical distancing of two metres cannot be observed.How far can I go to exercise?You are still only permitted to travel 5km from your home.But tennis clubs and golf courses are reopening and mine are six kilometres away?Yes, public sports amenities such as playing pitches, tennis courts and golf courses are reopening, provided they can maintain physical distancing rules, but you are still not allowed to travel to them if they are more than 5km from your home. The intention of this rule is reduce the risk of the virus spreading and that means limiting journeys.What other sports can restart?The Government says that outdoor sporting and fitness activities – either inidually or in groups of no more than four people – are permitted provided that social distancing can be maintained and there is no physical contact between the four people.What other public sites are open?Car parks, beaches and mountain walks are reopening but again only if physical distancing can be observed and you can only travel to them if they are 5km from your home.What businesses are reopening?Construction workers can return to building sites and other outdoor workers such as gardeners can start work again but only if it is safe to do so with observed physical distancing and personal protective equipment if required.What shops can reopen?The retailers that can reopen are hardware – but not homeware – shops farmers’ markets builders’ merchants and those that provide essential supplies and tools for gardeners farming and agriculture opticians, optometrists and outlets providing hearing tests and selling hearing aids retailers selling, supplying and repairing motor vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles and related facilities, including tyre sales and repairs office products and services electrical, IT and phone sales, repairs and maintenance services for home. Can schools and colleges reopen?Not for students. They may reopen for teachers and staff but only for remote learning to allow them to distribute learning materials, related materials and essential administration.Can I travel overseas in this phase of reopening?The Government says that any non-essential overseas travel should be avoided. If you do travel overseas, you will be forced to self-isolate for 14 days on your return home.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256576.1589826610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"significantly higher traffic volumes on some roads figures show","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTraffic on the M11 near Shankhill, Dublin. Photograph: Tim O’BrienTraffic volumes not seen since coronavirus restrictions were introduced have been evident on the State’s main roads and motorways, according to figures from roads manager, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). On the first day of easing lockdown restrictions, vehicle counters set into key national routes and motorways showed increases of up to 38 percent in the morning rush, with vehicle numbers increasing by more then 25 percent across most roads, since one week ago. TII compares traffic numbers in real time on a daily basis and publishes figures on its webside for vehicle numbers today, on this day last week and on this day last year. Numbers increased dramatically on Monday between about 20 percent and 38 percent on most routes, when compared to Monday of last week. The numbers of cars and vans had not been seen since before restrictions in relation to travel were introduced on March 27th this year. Following the restrictions traffic volumes fell by about 65-70 percent across the network.But on Monday traffic volumes were back to about half what they were on this date last year, on average. A note from TII said an upward trend had been apparent from Tuesday 21st April.Traffic figures measured from 7am to 10am on Monday showed the highest volumes since the introduction of restrictions in March. TII traffic counters which can distinguish between lorries and cars recorded: - On the M50 between the Finglas and Navan junctions traffic volumes rose by 28 percent on last Monday and were down 55 percent on May 18th last year. - On the M1 south of the Border at Jonesboro, traffic volumes were up 38 percent on last Monday and were down 68 percent on May 18th last year. - On the M4 between Celbridge and Maynooth the volumes were up 28 percent on last week, and were down 49 percent on 2019. - Traffic into Galway and Limerick was up by 25 percent each on last week traffic on the N7 at Citywest heading for Dublin was up 27 percent and traffic on the M11 near Bray was up 32 percent.TII said Monday’s traffic volume was “significantly higher” than in recent weeks but noted that car numbers were still down by between 49-68 per cent when compared to this time last year. It comes as the first phase in easing of restrictions came into force from Monday seeing constructions sites and hardware stores reopening, four people being allowed to meet up as well as reopening of beaches, tennis clubs and golf clubs. Despite the increase in car numbers in certain parts of the country, AA Roadwatch said there had not be a “major surge” in numbers and that traffic on Monday morning remained “far lighter than the normal volume”.AA Roadwatch editor Elaine O’Sullivan said traffic levels in regional cities was very light and that the AA did not envisage any major increase in car use in the coming days.“We’ll probably see more traffic with the introduction of phase two on June 8th with more people able to go back to work,” she said. Lauren Olmeda, public affairs assistant with the National Transport Authority (NTA), said it was too early to give exact figures on public transport use this morning, noting that peak times had changed during lockdown with some people travelling in the afternoon and businesses opening at staggered times. Even as numbers start to go up, the NTA is confident that it can continue to maintain social distancing and accommodate people trying to get to work, said Ms Olmeda. The NTA will continue to operate a revised timetable for bus, train and tram transport services during the Government’s first phase of lifting restrictions and says extra capacity will be added as required. From today, the authority is advising all passengers to wear face coverings when using public transport following Government advice that people use facemasks in crowded indoor locations and when on public transportation. NTA chief executive Anne Graham has also urged people to only use public transport if their “journey is essential” and to otherwise considering cycling or walking to their destination where feasible.“If public transport is their only option, they should follow public health guidance when travelling,” Ms Graham said.AA Ireland said last week it expected roads to become busier from May 18th but that commuter behaviour could be “quite a bit different” given the lifestyle changes people have made during lockdown. In a recent survey of more than 7,000 commuters, AA Ireland found nearly a third of people plan to reduce their car use even after restrictions are eased while 37 per cent said they would limit their use of public transport. “It is a dilemma,” said director of consumer affairs Conor Faughnan. “For years people have been encouraged not to drive for commuting if possible, and rightly so. But our public transport is going to be challenged by social distancing and it seems that even with best practice applied people will be nervous.”As long as social distancing remains a part of our way of life, there will be more people working from home and smaller rush hours, said Mr Faughnan. “This, combined with nervousness around using public transport, means that we may be weeks or months away from seeing traffic volumes return to pre-Covid levels.”AA rescue callouts have started rising in recent days with the group attending an average of 324 breakdowns during weekdays with a peak of 385 breakdowns on Tuesday, May 5th – figures which are more in line with the levels the organisation dealt with before the Covid-19 pandemic.

This will include 7,500 healthcare professionals, who will help manually trace the contacts of anyone who has had a positive test and advise them on whether they need to isolate.But a clinician who has offered to take on such a role said it was scandalous how slowly the process was going.The NHS contacted recently retired medics who had already volunteered to return to work during the pandemic. Among them was Peter Chapman, 67, a retired surgeon from Hampshire, who said the process had been sluggish and left volunteers stuck in a morass of bureaucracy.He told The : They don\u0027t seem to work weekends or Bank Holidays, and do not appear to have any sense that we are in the midst of an emergency. It\u0027s scandalous that all these people with nothing to do who are prepared to help at very low-paid rates are not being utilised.The clinical professionals will be responsible for conducting telephone interviews with those who have tested positive for Covid-19, conducting public health risk assessments and providing medical advice to those who have specific concerns.They will be supported by call centre workers, who will contact people who have received alerts warning them that they may have come into contact with someone with the virus. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine first human trial shows signs creating immunity","story":"The first coronavirus vaccine tested on humans appears safe and generated antibodies which stopped the virus replicating, according to early trial results shared on Monday. Eight healthy volunteers saw few adverse effects after taking two doses of the potential vaccine, according to Moderna, its manufacturer based in Massachusetts. It appeared to trigger an immune response - the critical requirement of a working vaccine - producing neutralising antibodies in all eight of the patients. The levels of those antibodies were similar to that found in people who caught Covid-19 and then recovered. Dr Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, called the result a “first important step”, with much more testing needed. Some medical experts urged caution, seeking more data. A second phase of trials with around 600 people will begin soon, while a third involving thousands of people will start in July. Moderna\u0027s stock price was up 40 per cent in pre-market trading as the results emerged.  The positive news is only one step in the long road to a potential vaccine.Even if the coming trials are successful Moderna\u0027s vaccine would not be available until between January and June 2021. However, given there is some doubt that a vaccine can even be found, the results provide hope that a breakthrough can be achieved. US stock markets surged in early trading as the news emerged, with the Dow Jones industrial average initially up 3.5 per cent.Currently there is no proven treatment or vaccine for Covid-19. Dozens of companies across the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine. Three different doses of the potential vaccine were trialled by Moderna. The positive results were found in those who tried the low and medium doses. Only one participant who took these doses had any adverse reaction, a redness around the point of injection on the arm which eventually cleared.People who took the high dose saw more adverse reactions, including fever and headaches. The higher dose is expected to be eliminated from future trials. The company also announced that when the vaccine, called mRNA-1273, was given to mice who were then exposed to coronavirus the virus would not multiply in their lungs. Stephane Bancel, chief executive of Moderna, told The Washington Post: “We are very, very happy because first the vaccine was generally safe.Peter Jay Hotez, who is developing a coronavirus vaccine at the Baylor College of Medicine, told the paper that it would be important to see the exact level of antibodies produced in each participant. When Moderna\u0027s trial started in March it was believed to be the first time a potential coronavirus vaccine had been tested on humans. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one three private sector workers having wages paid state","story":"There are nearly 27.5 million people working in the private sector, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Mr Sunak said: As of the end of last week, eight million people from around a million businesses are covered by this scheme and having their wages paid by the Government to protect their jobs and their future security.On Monday, Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, called for clarity over the future of the scheme and warned that asking employers to start paying part of the subsidy risks a massive spike in job losses.Mr Sunak said: We are in deep consultation with both unions and business groups to make sure we get the design of the second part of this scheme right.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk can learn europes easing lockdown","story":"As Covid-19 began to surge across Europe earlier this year, Boris Johnson issued a clear warning of what was to come.“The numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating,” the Prime Minister told the nation on March 22. “We are only a matter of weeks – two or three – behind Italy.” On Monday, for the first time in two months, Italy finally began to emerge from one of the strictest lockdowns in the world.Italians will once again be allowed to visit museums and restaurants, while some shops will finally reopen. In Spain, officials announced similar restrictions would be lifted in some areas.The news might raise hopes, therefore, that the UK government is poised to do the same, perhaps in two or three weeks\u0027 time. Not so, according to leading scientists, who say this country\u0027s trajectory has fallen further behind our Mediterranean neighbours. Instead, the British public will likely be waiting “much longer” for normal life to return.The reasons are many and complicated, of course. But the main obstacle is this country’s stubbornly-high infection rate, compared to our European neighbours.On March 22, when the Prime Minister issued his warning, confirmed UK cases stood at 5,683, with a death total of 281. Two weeks before, on March 7, Italy had been in a similar situation with 233 deaths and 5,900 cases.Italy hit its peak number of 6,557 Covid-19 cases on March 21, but since then, daily cases have fallen steadily and quickly. Last Sunday, the Italian government announced only 675 new cases, a fall since the peak of nearly 90 per cent.Spain released figures on the same day showing that, from a peak of 8,271 cases on March 26, new infections had fallen to just 1,214, a fall of 85 per cent.Yet in the UK, figures show that from an early peak of 6,199 cases on April 5, the number fell to 3,534 on May 17, a drop of only 43 per cent.In short, the daily number of cases in the UK is falling much more slowly than in Italy and Spain. The UK\u0027s downward curve is far flatter.Professor Azeem Majeed, head of public health at Imperial College London, said the comparatively high infection rate in the UK meant lockdown measures would likely last far longer than in Italy or Spain.However, the UK government would have “the clear advantage” of seeing the effect of relaxing restrictions in other countries before deciding how to act, he added.“It helps to look at what’s happening in Italy and Spain, of course it does,” he said.“In some ways it will be useful to the UK government, because evidence will be coming in from those countries. “But the fact remains that the infection rate in this country is not dropping as fast, and that’s a major problem.“We are now far further than two or three weeks behind, in terms of trajectory.”Experts are split on the reasons why the UK’s number of daily cases remains so stubbornly high.Some leading scientists claim that the Government enforced total lockdown too late, meaning the virus became more deeply embedded, and harder to shift.Italy first began shutting down towns and cities on February 21, before ordering total lockdown on March 9. Spain followed a week later. It was not until March 23 that Boris Johnson finally ordered the British public to stay at home.The terms of the UK lockdown are also fairly lenient, compared to measures taken elsewhere in Europe. In Spain, people were banned for seven weeks from leaving their homes even to exercise, while in Italy the carabinieri patrolled the streets, arresting or fining anyone outside without good reason.Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior consultant in communicable disease control, claimed the UK would now “pay the price” for delaying lockdown too long.“The later you lock down, the longer it takes to get out of it,” he said.“It’s not surprising that we are plateauing, compared to those countries. We should have shut down much earlier, and had a testing and contact tracing in place to prevent the virus spreading.“We didn’t do that, and now we pay the price.“At the start of the epidemic we were said to be roughly three weeks behind the other countries, in terms of transmission. When it comes to leaving lockdown, I’m afraid we are now far further behind.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk joins 120 nations urging china allow independent inquiry","story":"The World Health Organization has backed calls for an independent inquiry into its handling of the pandemic as China pledged $2billion for efforts to contain the coronavirus in developing countries and the US accused the body of presiding over a costly failure. Speaking at the World Health Assembly - the decision-making body of the WHO - director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he welcomed a proposal by more than 120 countries - tabled by the European Union and Australia but not China - for a “stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of its response to the pandemic.Dr Tedros said he would launch “an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment“.However, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, told the assembly that the pandemic had spun out of control in great part due to a costly failure by the WHO.There was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,  he said. An early report into WHO’s handling of the crisis by its independent oversight body said that the organisation had “demonstrated leadership” and that its performance should be reviewed but not during the “heat of the response”.The report also said the WHO would need an estimated $1.7 billion to the end of the year, leaving it with a funding gap of $1.3 billion.Chinese president Xi Jinping told the assembly he would back a “comprehensive review” of the pandemic after it had been brought under control.Answering critics who said the country covered up the outbreak when it first emerged in Wuhan, central China at the end of last year Mr Xi insisted his country had acted with “openness, transparency and responsibility”, providing information to WHO and relevant countries in a ”timely fashion”.He also tried to smooth over criticism by announcing $2 billion to support virus response efforts, calling for continued research into the source of the virus, pledging to make vaccines a global public good when possible, and encouraging information-sharing on best practices.While it is unclear whether the Chinese pledge would be channelled directly to WHO such a significant sum cannot be overlooked, particularly given the shortfall in funding of both the WHO and the coronavirus response.The US is by far the WHO’s biggest donor, giving $400m in 2019 - however, president Donald Trump has threatened to cut off funding, accusing the organisation of mismanaging the response to the pandemic and of bias towards China. Although in recent days he has appeared to roll back on that.Amanda Glassman, executive director of the Center for Global Development at Georgetown University in the US, said: “My main question is, how will this money be channeled and will it be through the WHO. If yes, that would be interesting since the US has stated its intention to match China’s contribution to the WHO.”Mr Xi’s address was aimed at heading off critics, but what he said was very different from what Beijing had messaged, largely resisting a probe. Chinese state media has claimed nations are insisting on an investigation for political reasons, going so far as to blame the US for using China as a scapegoat for its own poor handling of the outbreak.In his address to the assembly - held virtually and with world leaders dialling in on sometimes shaky video links - Dr Tedros answered critics who said the organisation had been slow to respond at the beginning of the outbreak.  “WHO sounded the alarm early, and we sounded it often. We notified countries, issued guidance for health workers within 10 days, and declared a global health emergency — our highest level of alert — on the 30 of January.

The source also mentioned halting the purchase of Boeing aeroplanes.On Friday, the Trump administration renewed its executive order banning for another year, which bans American businesses from working with companies that pose a national security risk such as telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE and the smartphone maker Huawei. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it is a security risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe impact of the renewed ban is already shaping industry: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has reportedly stopped new orders from Huawei.TSMC is the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a key Huawei supplier, and had announced plans to build a US-based plant and was “following the U.S. export rule change closely”. The company has denied this, saying it does not disclose order details and added the report was “purely market rumour.”UK Huawei go-ahead sparks diplomatic row with AustraliaAlthough Huawei declined to make a statement when the extended ban was announced, the company has since said: “In its relentless pursuit to tighten its stranglehold on our company, the US government has decided to proceed and completely ignore the concerns of many companies and industry associations.”“This decision was arbitrary and pernicious, and threatens to undermine the entire industry worldwide. This new rule will impact the expansion, maintenance, and continuous operations of networks worth hundreds of billions of dollars that we have rolled out in more than 170 countries” the company continued.The most prominent effects of the ban to consumers have been that Google cannot provide Huawei with access to Google Mobile Services and therefore popular apps such as Maps and YouTube are not available on Huawei phones.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanTensions between the world’s two largest economies have spiked in recent weeks, with officials on both sides suggesting a hard-won deal that defused a bitter 18-month trade war could be abandoned months after it was signed in January.The United States “uses state power, under the so-called excuse of national security, and abuses export control measures to continuously oppress and contain specific enterprises of other countries” said an anonymous spokesperson on the Chinese government commerce ministry’s website.Debate has also been sparked in the UK over whether the government should use Huawei’s 5G technology, with some Conservative MPs arguing that Huawei should have a limited role in building the country’s network because of national security concerns.

Schools have been told to prepare for early year settings, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to the classroom in smaller sizes from the start of next month, and to start reintroducing more face-to-face lessons for Year 10 and Year 12 students. All primary school students would also be back in school for a month before summer under the government’s goal – advice one headteachers union has told its members to ignore as it is not “realistic”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent spoke to Steve Chalke, the founder of the Oasis trust – an academy trust with around 50 schools in England – and Alex Rawlings, the headteacher of Quarry Bank Primary School in the West Midlands, about their differing views on plans to get children back to school as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. 1. Are you planning on reopening your school(s) on 1 June? Do you support these plans?Steve Chalke: “Yes. But it is an important thing to say that some won’t be reopening at all, because they never shut. I think that has been lost in this conversation. Many of our schools have stayed open throughout to care for and work with the children of key workers and those who are most vulnerable.

Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“Our plan at one school is different for the plans for each of the other schools. We have 35 primaries. The reason they are different is because we have 35 different buildings. Some are bigger, some are smaller, some have wider corridors, some have narrower corridors, and they have different size classrooms, for example. “We are supportive of the government plans to open schools on June 1 because we are ready. Oasis is having a conversation in each locality with its school leaders, its parents, its community. We are talking with the unions and the government and that is why we are going to open on 1 June.”Alex Rawlings: “We are planning on a phased return of school on 2 June. We will be using 1 June to prepare the classrooms and school site. Our children in Early Years will start on 2 June followed by our Year 1 and Year 6 children on 8 June. We will remain open for our key worker and vulnerable children.“I wholeheartedly support the return to school for children, but only when we know it is safe.“The government has not done enough to convince a lot of parents nor school leaders that it is safe to return.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What are you planning to help your school reopen to students?Steve Chalke: “In some of our schools, we are doing a rota. Instead of having children in all day, we are having a cohort in the morning, and a different cohort in in the afternoon ... There is a gap when we can cleanse everything, clean it down, wipe everything. “Some schools will have fewer children in a classroom than others. The government has said you can have up to 15 in a classroom. Depending on the sizes of our classrooms, we are deciding how many children can go in them.“We have ordered and have got PPE equipment ... Any staff member or any child that wants PPE, it is there for them.“The way Oasis is geared up is there is a central team that supports all our schools. Some of this work, like ordering of PPE, has been done centrally so we can make sure all our schools have got that. We prepared a whole list of questions for our schools to ask themselves as they get ready.“We have done a full risk assessment of each inidual schools, so we have had a meeting for all 35 schools ... and we worked out the bespoke plan for each of the schools in that meeting.” Alex Rawlings: “I’m currently putting together plans to return as safely as we can. Some of those plans include additional hand washing stations, spacing of tables and chairs in classrooms, purchasing lidded bins so that waste can be disposed of according to the governments guidance, and buying coloured wristbands so groups of children can identify themselves from other groups and keep their distance.“It is however incredibly hard to plan for the reopening of school when the guidance changes on a daily basis. Boris Johnson originally said only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children were to return, then the guidance made reference to nursery and even now government officials neglect to mention nursery children returning also.“Schools had invested significant resources to planning a return that made sense to them and their communities. The government also released a document on Friday night explaining that schools should avoid using rota systems to accommodate children. Hundreds of schools would have been back to square one of planning, with only two weeks, including half-term, until schools are expected to open to those year groups.”3. What are the main difficulties schools face with regards to opening during coronavirus?Steve Chalke: “You should never do anything you haven’t thought about and carefully planned for. To open without doing the planning we have been able to do is a risk too far.“But then there is another answer. In the end, it isn’t PPE and it isn’t actively planning and risk assessment forms that get you there: it is trust.“The real foundation on which phased return to any school is built is trust. By that I mean, trust between school staff and leaders, and trust between parents and the school. If you have got all that trust going on and good communication, that is the final ingredient you need to open school. If you don’t have trust and a good relationship, it will be really hard because scaremongering breaks out and rumours start flying.”Alex Rawlings: “Inconsistent guidance from government which causes a lack of confidence in reopening and the logistics of following the guidance are hugely limiting.“Gavin Williamson said we were having a tentative start of reopening schools, when actually he has insisted that four out of eight year groups attend school. Those classes are halved, which requires double the space and double the supervision, which means that schools have to be at 100 per cent staffing capacity to safely open. With lots of adults shielding or self-isolating, schools do not have the staffing capacity to reopen – we will only just be able to, hopefully.“The most difficult aspect to sort is to try to increase parental confidence in school’s ability to keep everyone safe. Everyone knows it is going to be impossible to keep 3 and 4 year olds apart at a distance of two metres. In every workplace in the country you are to socially distance unless you have adequate PPE. Schools have been told that social distancing isn’t attainable whilst working with children and that it isn’t recommended that schools use PPE routinely.“Adults will never have confidence in government plans to reopen until they can tell everyone what makes a school classroom uniquely safe when compared to any other workspace in the entire United Kingdom.”4. What are the benefits of getting children back in the classroom, as opposed to home learning?Steve Chalke: “I think they are huge. A report done for the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown a massive gap between the rich and the poor in the amount of homework study being done. It said the more middle class you are or wealthy you are, the more digital access you have, more laptops and and the more time parents have got to spend with you ... But it is much worse than what they are saying.They are saying across this period, wealthy children will have done seven days more work by the end of this than others. I think this is woefully underestimated. All our schools are in poor communities, some of our kids haven’t been receiving dinners as government system has failed all together.“Why do we need to get these schools open? For learning to continue. Around four million children in England live in poverty. The children commissioners office say two million live in homes where there is domestic abuse, where there is parental substance misuse or parental mental health issues. All of those figures come before lockdown. How do you think those figures have gone up? The longer these children wait for a return to school, the greater the negative impact on their learning, their health and on their safety.”Alex Rawlings: “The benefits to getting children back are clear – children will receive improved education provision and they will see their friends, which is really important.“Parents have worked incredibly hard with their children at home but it is very difficult to turn a dining room in to a classroom and it is obviously not as successful as being in a classroom environment.”5. What are your concerns (if any) about the plans to reopen on 1 June?Steve Chalke: “Where the type of things we have been talking about haven’t been done, I would be very wary of opening a school. But I think there are still two weeks to go.“My advice is to a school that is on its own, that don’t feel they have got the support they need, I think I would really happy to provide people with an understanding of the kind of approach we have adopted.”I’ve been a teacher for 23 years – re-opening schools is dangerousAlex Rawlings: ”Children are being used as guinea pigs.“The government are trying to push a narrative that if you care for children then you will promote the reopening of schools. Every member of our school staff cares deeply for the children in their care and want nothing more for them to return, but only when it is safe to do so.“There has not been enough time, clear guidance or scientific evidence to suggest that it is the right time to do so.“Everyone keeps referring to the Danish model and how that has worked. It is a ridiculous comparison. Denmark’s deaths are in the hundreds, ours are in the tens of thousands. Denmark were one of the first countries to close its schools (we were one of the last) and they returned when only a few hundred people were in intensive care being treated for coronavirus, we have thousands.”6.  Do you feel the science is clear enough to show schools are safe to reopen on 1 June?Steve Chalke: “Yes. I think the problem is the unions and all the people commentating on this aren’t the scientists. So what we have tried to do throughout the whole process has really talk to people who are in the middle of the science. I heard Brian Cox say – and I agree with this totally – anyone who tell you they are following the science doesn’t understand science. Science is a debate.”Alex Rawlings: “On Friday night, the government released the science that was supposed to convince schools that it was safe to open. This document contains no science, just a regurgitation of their own guidance.“The science hasn’t been adequately shared despite it being promised. The Department for Education’s own scientific advisor conceded to having not read the guidance and had not been consulted about reopening of schools during an Ed Select Committee meeting, only for the Department for Education to release a statement later saying that he knew.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being back with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing.“Plans for a phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.”They added: “We have engaged closely with the unions throughout the past eight weeks, including organising for them to hear directly from the scientific experts last week, and will continue to do so, including to develop further guidance if required.”Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anyone with this symptom should isolate for seven days while other household members should isolate for 14 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdding anosmia to the list of symptoms could be a crucial move as the government looks to set up a test, track and isolate system to control the virus after lockdown restrictions are lifted.But officials have faced criticism that the addition of loss of smell has come too late.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Professor Tim Spector, head of the department of genetic epidemiology and leader of the Covid symptom study app at King’s College London, told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that 17 other countries including the US had altered their list of symptoms beyond a cough and fever.While the KCL app uses self-reported symptoms that are not verified, Prof Spector said using its data he estimated between 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with Covid-19 were not being told to self-isolate because their symptoms did not match the official definition.He said: “We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test, and these are not being picked up by the NHS.”The loss of smell and taste has been repeatedly reported as a symptom of Covid-19. Health minister Nadine Dorries reported losing 100 per cent of her taste and smell when she contracted the virus in March.Last week, the British Rhinological Society and ENT UK criticised the government for being slow to act. In a joint statement, the two bodies said they had warned eight weeks ago that anosmia was linked to Covid-19, adding that there was now “overwhelming evidence” it was a main symptom and accused the NHS and health officials of “clinical negligence” for not adding anosmia to the official list of symptoms.Carl Philpott, professor of rhinology and olfactology at Norwich Medical School, said: “The announcement that the chief medical officers have now recognised smell and taste disturbances is extremely welcome, albeit much later than other European counterparts and at least two weeks after the WHO added it to their list. This will hopefully now be another measure by which the pandemic can be contained, especially as in some people it may be the only symptom or may precede other symptoms.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“This is particularly pertinent in healthcare workers where reports of smell and taste disturbances have been commonplace, meaning the transfer of infection from colleagues to each other and to uninfected patients will have been happening unchecked. There will also be a recognition that although many patients will recover these senses, the need for ongoing support will be faced by a minority in whom these sensory losses persist.”Briefing journalists this morning, deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van Tam said the government’s scientific advisers on its new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, or Nervtag, had carried out a “granular” assessment of Public Health England’s database of the first few hundred Covid-19 cases.He said: “The reason for making the change now is that there has been a signal around possibly the importance of the anosmia as a symptom of Covid-19 for a while now. It’s been important to continue to look at that. And be sure that we consider it, and introduce it at the right time, when we think it’s going to make a difference moving forward, to how we pick up cases.“We do know of some cases where it appears early, but in many cases, it does not appear early.”Why are loss of smell and taste symptoms of coronavirus?He added: “The question for Nervtag has always been at what point can we be sure that by adding anosmia, or anything else, such fatigue, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, definitely improve and help us to pick up cases. That work has now been completed and that’s why we’ve got to the position we have now. It’s not just about whether or not anosmia exists. It’s about what role it plays in identifying cases, and that’s taken time to work through those data.”He said while anosmia could last for many weeks, no one would need to isolate longer than the official advice of seven days.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This results in extra cosmic rays entering the solar system.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNeutron counts from the University of Oulu\u0027s Sodankyla Geophysical Observatory show that cosmic rays reaching Earth in 2020 are near a Space Age peak” wrote Dr. Tony Phillips on his website. “So far this year, the sun has been blank 76 per cent of the time, a rate surpassed only once before in the Space Age. Last year, 2019, the sun was blank 77 per cent of the time. Two consecutive years of record-setting spotlessness adds up to a very deep Solar Minimum” Phillips also wrote, while suggesting that “excess cosmic rays...affect the electro-chemistry of Earth’s upper atmosphere and may help trigger lightning.”Astronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSome have speculated that the lowered output from the sun could result in a “Little Ice Age”, similar to the one that occurred between the 14th and 19th century and happened concurrently with mountain glacier expansion in the European Alps, New Zealand, and Alaska among other locations, and lower temperatures across the northern hemisphere.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This can pose an increased threat to astronauts travelling through space” Pesnell says.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Sage absolutely is a committee that advises the whole of the nation in that sense.”Foreign secretary Dominic Raab insisted that we’ve actually had a UK-wide approach, adding: Equally we’ve recognised that, given the devolved competences and the level of coronavirus in different parts of the UK, there may be different speeds at which the different nations proceed, or even at regional level.Northern Ireland\u0027s official coronavirus death toll currently sits at 482, with fewer than 5,000 confirmed cases. However a report from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency found that, by 8 May, there had been 599 fatalities where the death certificate mentioned Covid-19.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its 48 coaches run a range of sports programmes, including basketball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and yoga.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLuca Toth, a head coach at the charity, taught volleyball at the Central Foundation Girls’ School in Tower Hamlets. She tells The Independent: “I see sports coaching as a tool to get close to the girls and be a mentor figure. We teach them teamwork, to persevere and to handle disappointment.”Some 67 per cent of the young people Greenhouse mentors live in postcodes classed as “deprived”. Just north of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in Marylebone lies Church Street Ward, one of the most deprived wards nationally. Figures from 2017 suggest more than half of children in the area live in poverty.How to support our campaignA spokesperson for Greenhouse tells The Independent: “Lockdown came in and suddenly kids were completely cut off. One child could have had a breakfast club, a lunch club, a PE session and an afternoon sports session with us. A lot of the kids are going back to home lives that are very difficult, in confined spaces.”Some children that it mentors come from families where sport is not seen as a cultural priority. Others do not speak English at home. “The Joe Wicks PE experience might not actually cut through to them.”Joel Archard, a father of three, calls Greenhouse “a beacon of the community” over the phone with The Independent. His daughter Luna, now 12 years old, plays table tennis with Maria, another coach and mentor. “They didn’t let the lockdown stop them. They do zoom calls, and ask ‘how are you doing?’. It gives the kids a bit of structure to their lives.Greenhouse is also preparing for the end of lockdown. “Everything is pointing to the fact that the recession will hit the kind of families we deal with hardest, especially young people who have missed school,” says a spokesperson.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now delivers close to 100 food packages a day.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project and former COO of Greenhouse Sports, says: “The Felix Project is proud to have worked closely with Greenhouse Sports for many years. During this health crisis it’s great to see them open up their amazing sports centre at the heart of the local community. We applaud their innovation.”Help The Hungry campaign to feed vulnerable Londoners raises over £4mVolunteers cook for neighbours struggling without food during crisisMarathons and piggy-back challenges help The Independent raise £3.7mTwo other organisations that have innovated to support our campaign under lockdown are Holland \u0026amp Barrett and Daylesford Organic. Holland \u0026amp Barrett, a regular supplier of The Felix Project, has donated 2,000 units of vitamin D for elderly people stuck at home at risk of deficiency.Daylesford Organic has released a range of fermented vegetables with Felix Project branding. The farm shop offers “ferments” of radish and butternut squash as “unusual” garnishes for meals or cocktails. It expects to raise an additional £10,000 per year, and all profits from the products go to the charity.Luca, the volleyball coach from Greenhouse, expresses her concern about her children’s welfare through this crisis. “There is probably no privacy for many of the kids sharing rooms. I’m worried that the ones who were ok when we left will suffer, and those who weren’t ok at the beginning will come back worse.“We are dealing with so many people who need us. I have seen what a change we have made in these people’s lives.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Richard Smith, supply manager of The Felix Project, said they had “really stepped up to the plate”.How to support our campaign“Some companies have hugely increased their supplies to us,” he said. “Innocent normally give us five pallets a week but this week we took 24 pallets off them. Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together. The fantastic volunteers from Caprice Holdings restaurants and The Ivy Collections have been cooking 20,000 meals a week to supply, in partnership with Felix, some of London’s vulnerable communities. Together we can make a difference.”An online fruit and veg box company which gave 7 tons.

Working with Felix means we can prevent delicious food from going to waste.”The catering suppliers donated 7 tons.

Ryan Kerr, head of M\u0026ampS’s north London region, said: “Through our partnership with community platform Neighbourly, our northwest London stores have donated 3,200 meals to Felix since the start of March to support those who need it most in these communities.”The supermarket gave 9 tons.

There’s always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus.”“The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if, for any reason, there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.”Mr Gove urged councils, teaching unions and doctors to “think again” about opposition to reopening primary school classrooms in England from 1 June, as proposed by the government, telling them that if they really care about children they should look to their responsibilities.Medics turn their backs in protest at Belgian PM’s handling of virusLabour is pressing the government to publish the scientific evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools, and to keep talking to unions, teachers and councils to ensure parents can be confident their children will be safe if they return.Rachel Reeves, shadow Cabinet Office minister, told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The government have got a lot more work to do to give that confidence that it will be safe to send children back in two weeks’ time.“The government have got two weeks to get this right. They haven’t approached this in the right way so far.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But Mr Hancock faced criticism over the test-and-trace system as he refused to set a date for the programme to start – after Downing Street said the next stage of lockdown-easing could begin without it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are also fears that the expansion of the testing policy will mean greater demand on key chemicals that laboratories say are already in short supply.Mr Hancock told the House of Commons: “Every day we are creating more capacity and that means more people can be tested, and the virus has fewer places to hide.“Today, I can announce to the house that everyone aged five and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test. That applies right across the UK in all four nations from now.“Anyone with a new continuous cough, a high temperature or the loss or change of sense of taste or smell can book a test by visiting nhs.ukcoronavirus.”Mr Hancock claimed his benchmark of 100,000 Covid-19 tests had been hit on Sunday, although this includes tens of thousands “in the post” and not yet administered.From a tiny number of tests at the start of the pandemic in March, the UK’s programme had been “scaled at breathtaking pace into a global champion”, he claimed.But Allan Wilson, president of the Institute for Biomedical Scientists, which represents NHS laboratory staff, said the announcement on testing expansion was “more of the same” from the government, with what he described as “reactive” announcements and creating new targets rather than concentrating on a full testing strategy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Are we prioritising anyone over the age of five, key workers or on a first-come-first-served basis?”Mr Wilson said the announcement would increase pressure on the government’s Lighthouse Laboratories, which carry out the coronavirus testing, rather than the NHS. But he added: “We are still competing with them for the same reagents for the test. The supply chain is still very hand-to-mouth.“The Lighthouse Labs don’t seem to be able to get much above the 100,000 tests a day and it’s not clear where this extra capacity is coming from.”In recent days there have been problems with testing and data from the commercial labs being made available to local health officials.Mr Hancock also came under pressure over how long it takes for test results to come back, ducking a question from Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow health spokesperson, asking for the average wait for returns from the private firms running the drive-through facilities.Mr Hancock also strongly denied delays of 96 hours – when Rushanara Ali, a Labour backbencher, warned it would put people “at risk” – but was unable to give an alternative figure.The health secretary said there were now 21,000 contact tracers in England – including “7,500 health care professionals” to help the call handlers, more than the 3,000 originally suggested.“They will help manually trace the contacts of anyone who’s had a positive test and advise them on whether they need to isolate. They have rigorous training,” he said.France sees 70 Covid-19 cases linked to schools days after reopeningJudge Rinder accuses government of ‘negligent’ coronavirus adviceCoronavirus quarantine for UK arrivals delayed until JuneLoss of smell and taste now officially a coronavirus symptomEarlier, Boris Johnson’s spokesperson, when asked when tracing would be fully operational, said only that this would happen “in the coming weeks”.Jonathan Ashworth demanded a date for it starting – and details for how people in contact with carriers would isolate – but Mr Hancock swerved both questions.And Mr Hancock again dismissed growing criticism that care home residents were put at risk after patients were moved there from hospitals without being tested, helping to explain the high deaths rate there.“There has been no large-scale removal of people from hospitals into care homes, as has been implied by some,” he told MPs. “Those movements have been done with care.”And on care homes he again played down that 38 per cent have suffered Covid-19 cases, saying: “The majority of care homes have not had outbreak at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A July 2019 progress report published a year later said a formal consultation was on the way, but none has yet materialised.Gay conversion therapy may be banned in nine countriesFarage defends \u0027gay conversion\u0027 remarks from Brexit Party\u0027s WiddecombeMay vows to eradicate gay conversion therapy in LGBT+ planMs Badenoch suggested on Monday that there were no immediate proposals to change the law and made no mention of the promised consultation.Conversion therapy is a very complex issue, Ms Badenoch said in a written parliamentary written answer replying to a question about plans for legislation.There are a wide range of practices which may fall within its scope and we want to ensure we have a thorough understanding of the situation in the UK to inform an effective approach. Before any decision is made on proposals for ending conversion therapy we must understand the problem, the range of options available and the impact they would have. We will work to deepen our understanding and consider all options for ending the practice of conversion therapy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Laura Russell, director of campaigns, policy and research at Stonewall told The Independent: Any form of ‘therapy’ that attempts to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity is unethical and wrong. These so-called conversion therapies have been condemned by all major UK health organisations as they try to shame a person into denying a core part of who they are, and this can have a seriously harmful impact on their mental health and wellbeing. The National LGBT Government survey found that 2 per cent of LGBT people have undergone conversion therapy, and a further 5 per cent have been offered it. We’d urge the Government to remain committed to take the steps they can to end this harmful practice.Created with Sketch.Top 25 LGBT moments in pop culture since Stonewall Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A song about a young gay man leaving home, accompanied by a video which shows desire, persecution, rejection and ultimate freedom, Jimmy Somerville’s anthem epitomised the experience of generations of gay men.Singer Dana International provided another big moment of visibility for transgender people when she won the competition for Israel with her song “Diva”.325 23.

“the end of the month” at the earliest – a two-week delay – with phase two of restriction-easing due to start on 1 June.But Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said phase two would not be delayed even if

As a result, researchers have ruled out the use of this dose in later trials. One person who received the middle dose experience more severe side effects, but all of the symptoms were temporary and resolved themselves on their own, the statement said.In light of the findings the company has said the experimental vaccine is thought to be “generally safe and well-tolerated”.The next phase of the trial, which will see the company will administer the vaccine to 600 patients, is set to begin shortly.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet.

The move initially spelled relief: the end of homeschooling for many hundreds of thousands of exhausted French parents, many of whom were also working from home.But French education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer sounded the alarm on Monday, telling French radio RTL that the return has put some children in new danger of contamination. He said the affected schools are being closed immediately. French media reported that seven schools in northern France were closed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe situation highlights the precarious situation the French government is finding itself in as it seeks both to reassure the public that the country is moving forward past coronavirus and to react prudently to safeguard public health.Mr Blanquer did not specify if the 70 cases of Covid-19 were among students or teachers.Created with Sketch.Europe emerges from lockdowns across the continent Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two elderly

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I talked to the Chief Scientic Adviser yesterday.Running through the figures, the R number, we are confident that children and teachers will be safe, providing the right measures are in place.He added that it is extremely unlikely that any school will be the source of a Covid- outbreak.We know that school settings are not the source of infection that some have feared we know that they can be made safe and appropriate working places, he said.But when grilled on the claims he stressed: you can never eliminate risk and added: There is always, always, always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching the coronavirus.Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organisation’s Chief Scientist, also said on Sunday that “there have not been big outbreaks in schools” and the early results of studies are “very reassuring”.She said that “the risks to children are extremely low with this infection, and there have not been many cases described of children transmitting it to others, particularly within school settings”.Therevealed that Sage - the Governments scientic advisory group - is preparing to publish its own evidence in the coming days which will set out the thinking behind recommending that schools reopen gradually.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This country is missing them all and not only underestimating cases, but also putting people at risk and continuing the epidemic.Theres no point telling people to be alertthey dont know the symptoms.ENT UK, the professional membership body representing ear, nose and throat surgery in the UK, said it had first warned that loss of smell and taste were symptoms of coronavirus eight weeks ago, saying it had shared those details with PHE.The World Health Organisationlisted loss of smell and taste as less common symptoms several weeks ago and other countries, including the US, added the symptom.Despite these warnings, Prof Van-Tam said on April  that the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Grouphad looked at the issue and concluded loss of smell or taste should not be added to the UKs symptom list.But on Monday, that guidance was changed, with Prof Van-Tam saying advisers had needed to look at the issue in detail.He said scientists had had to work out very carefully how valid loss of taste or smell were in counting cases and where in the course of an illness the symptoms might occur. Prof Spectors paper cited loss of smell and taste as being more frequent in people who test positive but very much in the presence of other symptoms, he added.The question for Nervtag has always been: At what point can we be sure that by adding anosmiaor adding anything , frankly - theres plenty of other things such as fatigue, diarrhoea loss of appetite - at what point would adding any of these definitely improve and help us to pick up cases That work has now been completed. And thats why weve got to the position we have now, not just about whether or not anosmia exists - its about what role it plays in identying cases, and thats taken time to work through those data.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out plans for easier, faster and simpler testing so more people can access a Covid- test to tellthey currently have the virus. Wider testing will be essential before the government can ease up properly on the UK lockdown - because itaposll show whether the virus is running rampant again. Mr Hancock told the House of Commons on May : Everyone aged  and over with symptoms is now eligible for a test. That applies right across the UK in all four nations from now. It was the latest expansion in eligibility, three weeks after testing was extended to over-s or people who need to leave home for work, with symptoms.The Health Secretary added: Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there has been heavy demand on new kits posted to your home. Meanwhile, critics have slammed the slow rollout of testing to the wider community after it was initially ditched due to lack of capacity in March. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work. Who is eligible for a test   As the UK extends its testing capacity a growing list of people are eligible to be tested:All those in the UK who have symptoms and are over five years old in the UK All those working on the frontline in health and social care * Patients in the NHS and residents in care homes **But thereaposs a catch... What about care homes  More than a third of all the nationaposs care homes have had an outbreak after repeated failings to take tests early in the pandemic. Staff and residents were not routinely able to have a coronavirus test until April . And nor were patients coming into care homes from hospitals routinely tested until that date. The governmentaposs guidance now says care home residents and staff can be tested, with or without symptoms. But the governmentaposs roadmap for easing lockdown says this is only expected to roll out fully by June . How sick do you have to be   You need to show symptoms in order to be tested, unless you are in a care home of the NHS. The three main symptoms are a new and persistent dry cough a temperature and changes to your sense of taste or smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test  Visit the governmentaposs web page. Slots for home testing kits tend to appear at am and can be snapped up quickly. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive   For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. Home testing kits have been available since late April. The availability of these was limited at first, with , selling out within two minutes on the first day. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. How long will I wait for results     The government claims test results are being turned around and sent out within  hours, or  hours for home testing kits after you send the sample off. Test results come by text message. But many have reported longer waits for tests to come back. Why were essential workers getting tested first  The aim was simple - to ensure they can get back to work. Because the test showsyou currently have Covid-, it also can given an indication that your cough is just a  alarm. So people whoaposve been self-isolating to protect others due to a mild cough can get back on the front line.

Primary schools in England are meant to reopen from June , starting with Years R,  and . But unions and some whole cities are staging a revolt, warning there is not yet enough evidence that itaposs safe. The key questions are whether children are infected like adults are whether they then spread the virus to others and whether theyaposre less likely to get seriously ill and die. The science is still evolving, and papers from the governmentaposs scientic advisors are expected to be published in the coming days. But we do already have some hints about what the evidence shows. These have come in several forms, but here in England weaposve had two very helpful updates in recent days. They are an overview of scientic advice from the Department for Education, and an update from Englandaposs Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Prof Jonathan Van Tam. They both say children could be as likely to get infected as adults but that when they are infected, theyaposre much less likely to get sick. The key question for reopening schools, though, is how much children transmit the virus to others - and hereaposs also where the evidence is hazy. Here is what Prof Jonathan Van Tam and the Department for Education have said. Can children become infected with coronavirus  Yes.Government scientists believe younger children - aged up to  or  - might be less susceptible to getting infected with coronavirus.But they warn the “degree of confidence is low” - meaning they can’t be sure one way or the other. Prof Van Tam said emerging data suggests the rate at which children become infected is “about the same as in adults, possibility a little lower in the younger children”. Is coronavirus as serious in children as adults  No. When children get Covid- it’s usually a “much more mild” disease than in adults, Prof Van Tam said. It is pretty well established thatthey get coronavirus, young children are far less at risk of falling very ill or having to go to hospital. Medical experts believe up to  children in the UK have been affected from a condition similar to Kawasaki disease, which has been linked to coronavirus. However, the exact nature of any link is still being investigated and Prof Van Tam said we are talking about “very very very small numbers” of children.  How much do children transmit coronavirus to adults  Some studies suggest younger children may transmit the virus less than adults. But this evidence is mixed and provides a low degree of confidence at best”, the government says. Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam added the data is pretty sparse at the moment”.

Police were out in force on Monday as the operators stepped up services as lockdown measures ease slightly. The Rail Delivery Group said services this week will increase from about % of the standard timetable to %. However, capacity will be reduced to as little as % of normal levels to ensure social distancing, while passengers are being urged to avoid non-essential travel. But publishing guidance for both passengers and operators the Department for Transport warned that “there will be times and some settings on public transport where social distancing is not possible”. But with the Government calling on those who cannot work from home in certain industries toto work from tomorrow, it is inevitable that more people will be getting public transport. So here is the governmentaposs advice to make sure you can make any trip you have to take as safe as possible. Do not travelyouaposre unwell or clinically extremely vulnerable People have been asked not to take any non-essential travel by public transport, but evenyour trip is essential you shouldnapost take ityou have any coronavirus symptoms or are part of the vulnerable groups, people with underlying conditions, who the Government have urged to shield themselves. If youaposre self-isolating you should also, obviously, avoid public transport Check ahead and travel when quieter Even as public transport routes begin to step up activity, there is still likely to be disruption to the nornal arrangements, so the government is asking people to plan a head by identying alternative routes and options in case of unexpected disruption. They also suggest thatcan, travel at off-peak times, and you should ask your employer to consider letting you start late or leave early to avoid peaks.  Buy tickets ahead of timeOn some services you will now now required to book ahead of time. If you are travelling on  LNER trains then you need to know that is ‘reservation only’ travel from  May Passengers will have to reserve their seat orthey are using a flexible ticket such as a season ticket, they can avail the online seat reservation tool or speak to staff. Passengers who have an existing reservation should choose a seat at a distance and ignore the seat details. On other networks it has been recomended that where possible, that you book your travel online through your transport provider’s ticketing app or website. Some networks - like Nothern Rail - have said that the layout and frequency of trains might in order to ensure social distancing.So you must check the timetable ahead of time - and where possible just pick up your ticket in advance. Consider contactless payment to buy tickets. Try and keep social distance If you can take a less busy route, you should try and obviously where possible you should keep metres away from people. But where that isnapost possible the advice is to keep the time you spend nears others as short as possible and avoid physical contact. It adds: Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. To avoid crowds it suggests you try to start or end your journey using a station or mode of transport you know to be quieter or more direct. For instance, walk the first or last mile of your journey, or alight at an earlier station, where this is possible.  Wear a face covering and travel lightly While the guidance stresses that wearing a face covering is not a legal requirement it stresses thatyou can wear one while on public transport you should. And it suggests making a list of items that you need to take with you in order to minimise the luggage you take. Also, the advice suggests you donapost eat or drink on public transport. Pay attention to the safety instructions around you and follow basic travel ettiquette Operators have been told they must set out schemes to try and make travelling more secure and this will mean restrictions on where you stand or how to queue. It goes without saying that you should follow these. It may mean going into or out of a dferent entrance or only boarding from a particular part of the train or bus.

The unnamed woman should have been one of millions to benefit from a temporary £-a-week increase to Universal Credit, starting in April. But lawyers say she is £.-a-monthworseoff - because while repayments for her advances have risen, her actual welfare cash has been limited by the annual benefit cap.The woman, who has written a pre-action letter, the first stage of a legal action, could be one of thousands in the same situation. The single mum lives in a small two-bedroom house with her children aged , six, three and one. She said she was only having to repay advances because she fell victim to fraud. Now my children and I are suffering, she said in a statement through her lawyers. The changes to benefits in the pandemic have left me worse off when they were supposed to help me during this dficult time. How can that be right  She added: I have had to face extra costs because my -year-old and six-year-old aren’t in school. I am struggling to home-school them. I just want to receive the additional help other Universal Credit claimants are being given.”  The benefit cap affects , households - more than two-thirds of them single parents. The flagship Tory policy limits total annual benefits to £, or £, in London. Critics it creates apossocial cleansingapos by forcing families out of expensive areas with high rents.  The womanaposs lawyers Leigh Day argue the decision to keep applying the benefit cap and advance payment deductions is irrational and perverse. The legal firm say the policy violates her right to a family le under the European Convention on Human Rights .  And the case argues she has suffered unjustied discrimination because most of those hit by the benefit cap are single parents.

Bury in Greater Manchester has now joined Hartlepool and Liverpool as they reject plans to allow teachers and childrento the classroom on June . The council has now written to all headteachers in the area outlining the reasons behind their decision.The statement claimed the reopening classrooms would “pose an unacceptable risk to pupils, staff and communities of vulnerable people.” Labour councillor for Bury Tamoor Tariq said on Twitter that the governmentaposs position is ill advised and not one we can follow.Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson warned last week that he would resist sending kids back at the beginning of next month, saying he had concerns about whether schools would be able to operate safely. He told BBC Newsnight: “I’m not going to take risks with children’s lives or with staff and teaching professionalsapos lives.” While leaders in Hartlepool said it they would be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.Last weekend, senior minister Michael Gove told parents it was safe to send their kids back to school - but confusingly added aposthere would be risksapos.He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “It is absolutely safe,” then said the only way to be sure was to “stay at home” as there is “always, always... a risk”. Teaching unions fear it is unsafe for pupils and staff to go back to school on June . And Labour wants the test and trace system to be put in place before schools .  Mr Gove told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: Yes, teachers will be safe in schools... Some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to , absolutely safe for teachers and other staff toas well.But askedhe could guarantee no teacher would be infected as a result of ing to the classroom, he said: The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely.There is always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk, but... it’s extremely unlikely any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak, andfor any reason there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them. Universities aposcould rush to reopen campusesapos Universities could rush to reopen campuses when it is still unsafe to do so amid increased competition to attract students, MPs have been told. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union , warned that leaving the decision to institutions could be dangerous as financial pressures could encourage them to reopen prematurely. The Office for Students , the higher education regulator, has urged universities not to make any promises to students that everything will be back to normal in the autumn termthis is not the case.

Speaking at the Downing Street press conference Dominic Raab confirmed the delay, but said it wouldnapost necessarily delay lting lockdown measures. He said: “All of these steps are a balanced assessment, not just of one or other element, but particularly the R level and the prevalence of coronavirus. “It’s still our intention to roll it out across the country for everyone to use in the weeks ahead. I can’t be any more precise at this stage The app, which is central to the governmentaposs programme for containing the virus while lockdown eases, was originally due to launch by mid-May, according to previous comments by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman today said that the app would now be coming within weeks. It is currently being tested by people on the Isle of Wight, where the number of sign-ups is supposed to have exceeded expectations. The development of the app has also been fraught with technical issues, with previous designs struggling to overcome some limitations imposed on the app by phone manufacturers and operating systems. Last week Mr Hancock said the target for roll out was mid may in a conversation with Sky News. The Health Secretary said: “We’re rolling out in mid-May. The Isle of Wight project has gone well so far, we’ve learned a lot about how the app operates, also about people who don’t have the app – how to make sure that they can get testing and the contact tracing can work for them – the interaction of the technology and the human-based contact tracing. “We’re pleased with progress, and we’re going to bring it in. And we’re going to learn the lessons from the technical improvements that we’re making from what we’ve seen on the Isle of Wight.” On Monday No insisted that while the app would play an important roll in the future of the track and trace regime, it was possible to do track and tracing work separately to the app. It comes as Mr Hancock confirmed that , contract tracers have been hired.  At the weekend the figure was ,, and Hancock had set himself a target of , by this week. Mr Hancock says the , include , healthcare professionals, who will lead on particularly dangerous clusters, like those in care homes. The trainers have been given rigorous training and were praised by Mr Hancock for stepping up to serve their country in its hours of need.

The artwork that once adorned the walls will have been torn down, their desks spaced two metres apart and toys, Lego blocks and even old fashioned counting beads will have disappeared. Lunchtimes will be spent at desks, outside play equipment cordoned off, toilet times will be scheduled and contact with teachers so limited that they won’t even be able to put a plaster on a child who falls over. This will be the sterile reality of le in the UK’s , primaries when they open in June. And teachers fear it will have a huge emotional impact on kids.  One East Yorkshire teacher said: “We are worried how this will affect children’s mental health and also educational outcomes. “I’m concerned that parents are not being made aware of what education will look like and that their child’s experience will be far from normal. “Children have already undergone a lot of disruption and, at a time when we wish we couldto our normal routines in order to reassure them, I fear this will only unsettle them further.” Health Secretary Gavin Williamson has left it to inidual schools to have “flexibility” to follow Government guidelines, which mirror the approach of schools in Denmark which started a phasedin April. Head teachers now face the headache of making their schools safe for reception and Year One and Six primary classes and in just two weeks. The guidelines suggest schools introduce one-way systems for kids, ide corridors to keep them apart and stagger breaks as well as arrival and home times so parents don’t congregate. It’s also advised youngsters are placed into small gangs of friends who will not be allowed to mix with other sets or dferent years. Constant hand-washing will be in place when kids arrive, come in from play and before and after eating. The guidelines state: “Consider how to encourage young children to learn and practice these habits through games, songs and repetition.” One head teacher this week took the unusual move of spelling out the changes to parents on her school website, writing: “Some of the parents who want their child tohave stated this is for their mental health and well-being. “This worries me more as I do feel some of the measures I will have to take will completely work against this.”  In a list of changes, headed ‘The Truths’, headteacher Marianne Allan, of Cambois Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, told parents that all unnecessary furniture and equipment will be removed, teachers will not be allowed to sit beside pupils who need help and lunches will be eaten in classrooms. Ms Allan said children who fall over or have a toilet accident will be encouraged to change themselves or clean their scrape or cut. Otherwise parents will have to collect them. In a poignant message she wrote: “Today I looked at a memory on my phone. It was from a year ago today when some girls in year  and  made me the most beautul table for my lunch, it was covered in lip gloss to smell nice and full of sparkle and jewels. “This is the school I miss. These are the activities we hope to resume. “This will NOT be possible in June. This is the school we want to see back, where children run up and hug their teachers and friends. The school children can walk safely around a building without measures or go to the toilet without supervision and for them to be cleaned afterwards.”  The Government has prioritised reception and Year one learners because they are learning “basic essentials” and Year Six so they can prepare for the move to High School. In Secondaries, Year  and  will get some “face-to-face” time with teachers. But one primary teacher in Bridlington said: “The classrooms will be striped bare of any joy. “Art work will be banned from the wall, resources like counting bricks and beads will be banned to stop the spread of the virus. “Our school has made the decision not to mark exercise books for  hours just to be safe. “it’s so sad because there will be no toys for the little ones in reception and we won’t even be able to help them take bottle lids off their juicethey struggle. “I don’t say this to make parents feel guilty because I know some have no choice but to send their children, but they have a right to know what the reality will be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"aldi customers left retching after","story":"NewsAldi customers left retching after finding pus-filled lump on £. chickenDaisy Pike, from Enfield, London, bought the chicken from the Aldi Enfield Retail Park branch and said she \"ran to the toilet and physically had to be sick\" after the grim discoveryShareCommentsByBethan Sexton:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video aldi-customers-heaving-after-discovering-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news aldi-customers-left-retching-after-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror -

Horried Daisy Pike from Enfield, London, purchased the £. chicken to eat yesterday, but instead found the unusual mass. The -year-old filmed her friend Danielle Jones, as she cut into the foul-smelling lump, which she described as an abscess. As the clip begins, Danielle is seen rinsing the meat under a tap, as she handles the lump, she immediately begins to gag. She then squeezes the bulge which begins to emit a green, pus-like substance. She shrieks: Did you see that blood  That is a dirty abscess, what the f*** is going on  Danielle then decides to cut off the lump and Daisyaposs horried four-year-old asks: What the hell is that  The -year-old squashes the mass with the scissors and more white fluid oozes out. She replies: That is disgusting and heaving again, adds that it is all pus.  Daisy zooms in on the fleshy growth and says: That is absolutely rank. More fluid continues to stream out, causing the group to start retching again. A horried Daisy took to social media to warn others about the meat.  She posted the videos with the caption: Look at this please. This is why you should always check your meat. Aldi Enfield Retail Park, chicken full of puss, had a puss sack and all sorts. Disgusted ainapost the word. Be careful guys. Daisyaposs post has sickened social media users.  Lia McCarthy wrote: I canapost even watch this, look how grim. Patricia Jones added: I have never seen anything like that from meat I have brought from anywhere. And Lisa Arnold said: Omg! That literally made me nearly vomit. Speaking today, bartender Daisy said: It smelt really bad, the lump felt exactly like it wouldit was an abscess on a human.

Lancashire Police have released pictures of the light green Toyota Avensis in the hope of finding those responsible for her killing. Aya was reportedly gunned down from a car window while walking to Lidl just  metres from her home in Blackburn, Lancashire, yesterday. The aposappalling and senselessapos daylight shooting has left the local community in shock and her family aposutterly distraughtapos, police say. DCC Terry Woods, of Lancashire Police, said: “We believe a green-coloured Toyota Avensis was used to commit the offence, and this car was later recovered nearby. If you saw the car in the area of King Street and Whalley Banks, oryou saw it being abandoned on Wellington Road, again we would urge you to get in touch. Similarlyyou have information about who had been using this vehicle either on the day of the attack or in the weeks preceding, please tell us. Police say Aya was killed after a light green Toyota Avensis with numerous people inside drove past her. Bullets were fired from the vehicle, with one of them hitting the teen. Officers later found a Toyota Avensis with the registration SV UBP.  DCC Woods added: This was an appalling and senseless attack on an innocent young woman, whose le was cut short while she was simply out doing some shopping. “First and foremost our condolences are with her family, who have lost their daughter during the holy month of Ramadan. “In the last  hours we have learnt that Aya was a much-loved family member and friend who was enjoying her studies at the University of Salford. She also gave her time to being a young trustee of the Children’s Society. For her le to have been cut short like this is unthinkable and her family are understandably utterly distraught. He appealed for anyone in the King Street and Whalley Banks areas of Blackburn around the time of the killing to contact police. Ayaaposs family said:Our beautul -year-old daughter Aya has been taken from us in the most horric circumstances.She was the most loyal devoted daughter who enjoyed spending time with her family especially her brothers and sisters Ibraham, Assil and Amir. She excelled in her studies both at Blackburn Central High School and at Salford University where she was in her second year and dreamed of becoming a solicitor. She had just completed her exams and was learning to drive.

A study of , adults revealed almost three-quarters enjoy the mental boost they get from completing home improvements. One in  are left feeling less stressed, while % are aposcalmerapos after nailing a DIY task in their home. And two in five feel apossatisfiedapos after a spot of DIY, with almost a fth going as far as to say they feel aposrelaxedapos. It also emerged the lockdown has been a driver for many to tackle jobs around the home, as being there more than ever means they now notice what needs doing. But % admitted they had no idea just how much work there was to do. The research, commissioned by Ronseal, found doing DIY has helped more than two thirds combat boredom, while another one in three said it means they will have something to show for their time. Painting has been the most popular task over the last few weeks, with % giving their walls a fresh lick of paint, % sprucing their fences up and % getting their brushes out on the garden furniture. A further one in six have filled in wall cracks and one in  have upcycled furniture. Rob Green, from Ronseal, said: A lack of time and knowledge can make DIY a daunting prospect, and as a result, many simply put off the little jobs that need doing, even though most will be a simple fix. But after a while, you become so used to seeing the problems around the home that you donapost even notice them anymore - especially when you are busy going in and out all of the time. This is changing now we are all spending so much more time at home. When you are at home  , it becomes much harder to turn a blind eye to that bit of scuffed paintwork or the cracks in the walls you are now spending so much time looking at.  The study also found more than halfhave cracked on with DIY during lockdown, with an average of four jobs being completed - although they also have four tasks outstanding. Usually, DIY jobs are ignored for an average of eight weeks before finally being tackled, with a quarter admitting they caused more damage by leaving it untouched. Before lockdown, a lack of motivation , timeand confidencewere among the biggest barriers to completing home improvements. But % of those polled, via OnePoll, admitted they now have aposno excuseapos not to crack on with the jobs.  The study, by Ronseal which is partnered with the UK Menaposs Sheds Association, found that as well as being able to tick it off their to-do list, % said staying on top of DIY is good for their wellbeing. The UK Menaposs Sheds Association provides safe spaces across the country for many, including socially isolated people, to meet, share good times, learn and refine DIY and other practical skills together. Charlie Bethel, chief officer at the UK Menaposs Sheds Association, said: It has long been recognised that DIY can be good for your well-being. Our sheds are inclusive, welcoming spaces where anyone can get involved in practicing their skills and our movement continues to make a huge dference to the lives of our members and the communities that they support.

Kempsey Primary School in Worecstershire has been looking after  or so children of key workers during the lockdown. Some of the steps pupils are taking for their safety is a apostraffic lightapos system, which sees the children stand on spots while waiting to wash their hands. Other measures the school have taken include directional arrows on the floor to create a one-way system. Children also sit in segregated sections at lunchtime, with hot meals also prepared carefully for the local community. The tables are marked to show where pupils can sit at lunchtime and during classes. Bryony Barnes, head teacher, said the school is taking all precautionary measures to keep its pupils and staff safe when it reopens.She told Worcester News : Obviously this all depends on the governmentaposs five tests being met, but we are looking at what we can do to make sure the school is as safe as possible. It is a tricky one, but we are doing what we can to make it as safe as possible while also making the children and staff comfortable. We want them to be at ease as the school will obviously look and feel dferent when theyso we need to look at what we can do to reassure them and their parents and make them feel comfortable.Letters are being sent out to the parents, which will allow them to make their own decision about sending their children back to school. Staff are being trained on how to deal with pupils moving around the school while maintaining social distancing. Schools across England are preparing to open on June , despite concerns from parents and staff. But councils like Liverpool, Hartlepool and Bury have stated schools there will not reopen. Teaching unions warned the government’s evidence that reopening schools was safe from June  was “flimsy at best”. Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon said: The national advice telling us the lockdown is over is frankly madness. Opening schools was meant to happen as part of the second phase of easing the lockdown, at the same pace across the UK.  But Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all broken ranks and refused to reopen schools as soon as June . Meanwhile, the government has shown signs that dferent regions of England could end up taking dferent approaches. The plan is for primary schools to start reopening in a phased way as early as June . They would begin with years R,  and  ing in the first week of June, followed by years , ,  and  before the beginning of July.  Schools are being told to halve class sizes to , prevent those mini-classes mixing with any other classes, and implement one-way corridors, staggered break and start times and extra cleaning. Secondary schools are largely not expected back before the summer break. The exception is Years  and , who would get some face-to-face time to help transition to the next year. Exams are cancelled. Ministers have said there are no plans to keep schools open during the summer holidays.Yesterday top Tory Michael Gove claimed he could guarantee teachers will be safe - but then immediately admitted they might catch coronavirus.Askedhe could guarantee teachers will be safe when classrooms reopen, Mr Gove told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: Yes. I talked to the chief scientic advisor yesterday for the government, Patrick Vallance, and running through the figures - the R number, the rate of infection in the community overall - we’re confident that children and teachers will be safe.” Yet grilled over his claim, Mr Gove then admitted he could not guarantee all teachers would be safe. He said you can never eliminate risk and added: There is always, always, always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching the coronavirus.

The -year-old, who dreams of one day being a nurse, said: Being a carer is dficult, but Iaposm absolutely loving it. The residents are all so lonely because they canapost have visitors and they miss their families, so itaposs nice to be the one bit of joy in their day. A lot are pining for company but you have to keep your distance so you canapost give them a pat on the shoulder or a hug. Erin has been playing football since she was four years old and previously played for West Brom and Coventry United, before she took time off to recover from an injury. But the centre back, who has played as part of the England Colleges squad at an under- level, was forced to temporarily hang up her boots when all professional football was temporarily suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak. And Erin admitted parents Mo, , and Tony, , who she lives with, were initially worried about her working on the frontline instead.  She said: My friends said I was crazy when I signed up. Mum and dad were worried because they didnapost want me catching anything but we donapost have anyone vulnerable in our family. They are really proud of me because of the things I have to do, a lot of people couldnapost do them. I never thought Iaposd be able to do the gruesome parts of caring but itaposs shown me that I can be a nurse. Erin said her PPE is a bit dferent to her usual pageant attire as she sports a face mask, gloves, apron and face shield covering her stunning looks during regular shts. She has only told one resident about her modelling career, who thought it was aposamazingapos.  Erin said: Some think the PPE is funny and over the top but obviously you canapost risk giving them anything. The only lady I told about the competition really encourages me. She thinks itaposs amazing. Erin submitted videos and images of herself to the Miss England YouTube channel catwalking in her garden and showing off her keepy-uppy skills to earn her place in the beauty contest. The Miss England Midlands semi-final was due to take place last month at Resorts World in Birmingham, but due to lockdown restrictions the contest is being held virtually instead, with the public and judges selecting winners who will go through to the final. Organisers are currently unsure whether the grand final, due to be held on July , will go ahead physically as this may also be held virtually too.  Erin, who is sponsored by organic beauty company ST Essentials, said: The reason I entered the competition is because I thought it would build my confidence, but I understand why we canapost do it on stage with an audience. Doing it virtually is a bit dferent, but I donapost mind. I canapost wait to get back into football though. My dad loves that Iaposm into it and supports me so much, but Iaposve had to do a lot of Joe Wicks PE lessons instead to keep fit. Erin, who lost her other part-time job at a coffee shop when the pandemic became more serious, says the hardest part of her new career is seeing how lonely the elderly she cares for are.

The couple, who married in Ireland in March, had booked a stunning trip to South Africa, where they were due to go on safari. The newlyweds were then due to fly for a luxury sunshine beach break to an idyllic resort in Mauritius.But just after they said aposI doapos coronavirus put pay to their romantic plans and Monica and Matt had just ed to their home in Edinburgh, Scotland when the lockdown was introduced.Undeterred the loved-up couple were determined to make the most of the time they had together - and came up with a truly epic solution for their honeymoon woes. With three weeks already booked off work, they were determined to make the most of it - especially as their jobs often keep them apart. Monica is a nurse, so is often working shts, while Matt is a geologist and spends huge chunks of the year away travelling. Matt explained: Instead of being worried about the trip we had just lost, we thought letaposs make the most of the time and have our honeymoon here - so thataposs what we did. Every morning the -year-old made his we breakfast in bed and then made sure they went on a romantic walk. He said: We pretended to see African wildle, ate alfresco outside, got dressed up, and had candlelit dinners. We even got sunburnt in our garden, just like we would have done on our honeymoon. Even the lockdown couldnapost ruin their fun with -year-old Matt making sure they went on strolls to the stunning Arthuraposs Seat in Edinburgh, which is close to where they live. Matt said: When we saw a deer in Hunteraposs Bog we pretended it was an antelope, and when we saw birds we messed about pretending they were lesser spotted whatevers... it was fun. We played cards outside in our garden with a cold beer and glass of wine, just as we would have done on our trip. We focussed on each other and reminisced about our wedding. Monica grew up in Kilkenny in south east Ireland, so the couple decided thataposs where they wanted to marry. Scot Matt was born in Dunfermline before his family moved to Dumfries and Galloway. And, by lucky chance, just before Monica and Matt got married, he had tried a Vietnamese cooking course, which meant he could rustle up gourmet meals, just like those they would have had in their lavish honeymoon hotels.  He said: We upped our game and cooked nice meals for each other and tried to make them as presentable as possible, asthe meals were at our hotel on the trip. They celebrated every night with bubbles - to make it seem even more special for three weeks. The only disaster came when Matt tried to make sangria but used out-of-date lemonade - a definite no, no according to the new groom. And while their at home honeymoon wasnapost what Monica and Matt had been planning - he says he wouldnapost have changed a thing.

Tezra Finn-Johnston, , and girlfriend Emily Derrick, , first noticed their daughteraposs strength when they left hospital. They say at that early stage she was able to support her own head. She was born on January  and weighed just lbs oz and was on the th percentile - weighing less than five per cent of other babies her age. Now -weeks-old, Lula is able to stand unassisted, supporting her own weight. Tezra and Lula have been watching strongman clips on Youtube and think she might have been inspired. The first-time dad from Kingswood, Bristol said: When she was about a month old, she was having a tantrum and I tried to sit her on my knee to calm her. Instead of sitting down, she just stood on my knee and wouldnapost bend her legs. She did it a few more times later on in the weeks - eventually I thought wellshe can do it while sheaposs annoyed, maybe she can do it when sheaposs happy. I tried to hold her and supported her, and she managed to take her own weight. Everyone seems to think that itaposs unusual that she can hold herself up, even just sitting, let alone standing. I asked my mum - Iaposm one of four, and none of my siblings could hold their weight at her age. From everything Iaposm reading, it should be about nine months to a year that they should be able to support their own weight. The pair first noticed this when they brought Lula home from the hospital, five days after she was born. Tezra said: Pretty much from the day we left hospital she was able to support her head a little bit more than we thought she should be able to. She was holding it up for a few seconds and that shouldnapost be for a few weeks, but pretty much straight away she was able to do that.  Then we watched this Babies documentary on Netflix and on there they said babies are inherently programmed to crawl from birth.So I put her down on the mat and she was trying to crawl a bit. Then I put my arm behind her and she was able to push herself up the mat - propelling herself from my hand with her legs. She can also do it lying on her front as well. We noticed that and she was able to do that first time, so that was impressive. Iaposm just assisting her in doing what she likes doing - the first time we did it, she smiled at me. Itaposs like sheaposs showing off - she looks at you and smiles, itaposs like sheaposs trying to be a big girl! Tezra is a big fan of strongman competitions, regularly watching videos on Youtube. He claims Lula looks engaged when they watch the videos together - he jokes she might have been inspired by these to train herself. Tezra thinks another reason for her strength might be a good muscle-to-weight ratio, based on the fact she was a small baby at birth. One more might be her genes - Tezra stated that heaposs always been able to build muscle quickly.Tezra said: I donapost advise other people to try this with their baby, but I watched Babies on Netflix and in there I just got a few ideas from that really.Iaposve just always enjoyed being strong.When I was about , I started doing weight training and arm-wrestling - I was able to beat adults. Since then I just took up the weights. I just really enjoy being strong - not so much fit, but more the strength side of it. Iaposve always been interested in lting as heavy as I can. Only recently, since theyaposve had Youtube, Iaposve started watching some of the strong men on their private channels. Eddie Hall, they call him The Beast - he was the Worldaposs strongest man  and heaposs got his own Youtube channel, so Iaposve been watching that. Lula sits on my knee and we both watch that, so I like to think she is training herself.

But it will take more than  years for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to clear the sum. The cash was spent renovating Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage to the pair’s high standards after they married in . Meghan, , is understood to have chosen eco-friendly, toxin-free, vegan paint for the walls. Five apartments were knocked together to re-form the cottage, while beams, floors and the water and gas systems were replaced. But in the past six months the couple have spent just two weeks in what was meant to have become their family home. That is unlikely to change after they moved into a £.million, -bed Hollywood villa, loaned to them by actor Tyler Perry. And when they quit being full-time royals earlier this year, Harry vowed to repay the cash. Now it is believed the couple have agreed a “rental-plus” deal, above market rate, to keep Frogmore as their official UK base. The Queen has made it clear they can use it indefinitely. This year Buckingham Palace said they “will no longer receive public funds for royal duties”. But Graham Smith, from anti-monarchy group, Republic, said the couple are still more than rich enough to repay the money, “plus interest”, in one lump sum. He said: “Taxpayers need their money back, particularly now we’ve been hit by the huge costs of the coronavirus. “The couple, with their vast amount of millions in the bank, should explain why they aren’t paying it back immediately.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with everything you need in one placeThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Ministers have told schools to get ready for reception, year one and six toon June  - but only when all the tests are met as it will be safe to do so. Officials have issued advice to headteachers on ensuring classrooms and playgrounds are as safe as possible with class sizes capped at  pupils and desks kept two metres apart. However teaching unions and the government have locked horns over whether itaposs safe for kids to go back to school on June . Furious union bosses have ordered their members to refuse to engage with the government and have a string of conditions that must be met before theyaposllto their classrooms. Liverpool, Bury, Hartlepool and Gateshead councils have all said they will not be reopening schools on June . Downing Street suggested that a final approval could come as early as this week. A spokesman didnapost challenge claims that the final decision could come this week as next week is half-term He said: You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can. Officials are adamant that nothing will happen before June  while the Government will publish its scientic advice and SAGE minutes on safety in schools as soon as possible.  Union leader Geoff Barton claimed today that the government will make the final decision next Thursday which coincides with the next three-week review into the lockdown. He said: It is also important to understand that the government will only make the final decision on whether to press ahead with the reopening of schools when it reviews the latest science on May , and thatthe evidence does not support this decision at that time, it will be delayed.Yesterday Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government was aposconfident children and teachers will be safeapos when schools reopen.Speaking on the BBCaposs Andrew Marr show, he said: “The clear scientic and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen, accompanied with social distancing.  The Governmentaposs roadmap gives no specic date on when a decision will be made on any changed but they will be announced at least  hours in advance.The five tests set out by Boris Johnson must be met before any relaxing of the rules.The Prime Minister said at the weekend that three of those five have now been met with work being done on the other two. Parents have been promised they will not be punishedthey decide not to send their children to school.  Liverpool city council became the first local authority to announced it would not be reopening its schools on June . It said the earliest date for lessons to resume in the classroom will be June  and only year six, the oldest children, would be allowed back. Until then it will continue to allow only the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils to attend school. Hartlepool council and Gateshead council have announced they also plan to delay the reopening of their schools.  Last night policing minister Kit Malthouse hinted that some schools in some areas may reopen depending on their infection rates. He was asked on Radio aposs Westminster Hour last nightthat could lead to dferentrates for schools in dferent parts of the country, is that something that could happen  To which he replied: In theory it could. It’s certainly the reason for us setting up this new bio security centre, as I think was outlined when it was announced, so we can monitor the progress of the virus across the country. Andlocalised action is required, it can be taken,there’s a localised outbreak.

Come Monday afternoon temperatures will be around the C mark in the south east, the high teens in the south west and the east, and around C in Wales and the north east. As those living there know to expect, Scotland and Northern Ireland will have the worst of it with temperatures between C and C. This will be caused by two weather fronts which may bring showers and dark clouds overhead. The high pressure in the east and south means the inclement weather will be kept at bay. Then things will really start to warm up on Tuesday. Large swathes of England will bask in hours of uninterrupted sunshine and thermometer readings in the low to mid s. The further north and west you are, the higher the likelihood clouds will gather overhead and take the edge off the heat. In Wales, the north west, Northern Ireland and Scotland temperatures will peak in the mid-teens at around pm.  Wednesday will be really warm. As with Monday and Tuesday, the south and east are expected to have the best of the weather. In Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex the mercury will sit in the mid twenties for most of the afternoon. In Wales and the south west, C or C can be expected, while Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool are likely to see highs of C. Yorkshire and the north east, which are not always known for their balminess, may even hit the C mark. In Scotland the western coast will be slightly warmer than the east, where the pm sun may break through patchy clouds to take things to C or C. The hottest spot across the isles will be in London, where temperatures are creeping up into the high twenties.Bonnie Diamond, a Met Office forecaster, said: By Wednesday there will be low cloud to start the day, but this will lt quickly.It is expected to be the hottest day of the year so far with possibly C in London. The highest temps will be in eastern parts of England. York down to the east midlands could be C or higher.

I’ve not had anyone on to me about it all, there’s very little online about this week’s vote – I don’t think anyone really cares now.”Rangers vehemently led the call for a vote on an independent inquiry into the SPFL’s conduct during the coronavirus shutdown, as well as Dundee’s actions in changing their vote.That led to Gers fans bombarding online posts from the club and DSA social media, but Ross believes the reaction from fellow Dundee supporters is telling.He added: “Anytime the DSA are posting stuff on social media, we have to go through and delete loads of stuff.“It’s almost amusing now – Dundee fans responding generally laugh at them. Dundee have been getting hammered but they are not rising to it all and that, I think, shows the general feeling of the support.“It is bizarre because Dundee’s vote hasn’t affected Rangers really – our club has been affected more because there’s now no play-offs.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50444091-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50444091-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50444091-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.50444091-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee organisations team up to support students during ramadan","story":"A Dundee University society has teamed up with a local charity to deliver meals to anyone across the city who needs help breaking their fast during Ramadan.Dundee University Islamic Society is working in collaboration with Changemakers Yusuf Youth Initiative to help deliver meals to anyone in the community that might need help.Due to the coronavirus outbreak, Ramadan has been challenging for many as it has meant people cannot visit their local mosque or be with friends and family.Every year the Dundee Central Mosque offers free dinners for students and the local community to break their fasts, also known as Iftars.The partnership#s aim now is to deliver free -day Iftar packs with the makings of a home cooked meal as well as hot food.The project hopes to help build a community for students that aren’t local to Dundee and help get them through Ramadan.Shabana Stanikzai, president of Dundee University Islamic Society, said: “The blessed month of Ramadan is normally is a time of large gatherings in the mosques and community meals.“However, this year Ramadan is completely dferent as mosques are closed and social distancing measure are in place.

It’s about who we are as a club, at the heart of our city region, supporting our fans and the wider community. We know that many supporters are experiencing hardship and it’s therefore important that a partial refund is made available.#Having said that, the club continues to invest in  full-time staff who form part of our critical community outreach call centre. We could have furloughed this group of staff but feel we are doing the right thing continuing these wellbeing calls and food deliveries to the vulnerable.#I do hope supporters will have seen the widespread positive impact the club and trust is demonstrating in our city region. The reality is that we are facing a financial crisis entirely outwith our control. As such my appeal to season ticket members and seasonal corporate hospitality clients who are in a position to help the club financially and, in turn, the wider community, would be to leave any partial refund in the club to help ensure we stay a viable concern.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of other things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.This week we discuss the effect of the Corona virus  on the tours, Steevie#s discovery of old golf clubs which he hopes might make him his fortune, Rangefinders and other golf tech and we take a quick visit to the old course in St. AndrewsAn entertaining listen which you can download for freePlay or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rallyers in inverness action","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe opening round of the  KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championships took place in and around Inverness last weekend with a good entry of  cars.The event, on Saturday March , was three weeks later than usual to try and avoid the worst of the weather. There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall.

have been tested and could be opened immediately to host tourists, Friedrich Joussen, TUI Group CEO said.Several other European holiday spots could also be among the list of destinations, including Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Bulgaria, all of which Joussen described as ldquowell prepared for summer tourism.Austria and Denmark were named as possible destinations as well, being among a number of EU countries that are starting to reopen their borders.However, the roll out of flights to Europe will have to be done gradually, and in line with both government guidance on travel and the lting of EU borders.Holidays to Europe are also likely to be hindered by the  day quarantine period being enforced by many countries, with tourists faced with spending two weeks in quarantine in Spain before being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity.

The Scottish Government message remains simple and the same: stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives.The only signicant change in policy in Scotland currently is that you can exercise more than once a day, providing it is close to home, and done alone or with your household members.At this point it is crucial that we remain clear in our message, and do not lt restrictions before the evidence tells us it is safe to do so. Although nobody wants to be in lockdown, the Scottish Government are keeping this measure because it is what we need to do to stop the spread of the virus and stop people dying.A few weeks ago, the Scottish Government produced the lsquoFramework for Decision Makingrsquo which outlines the circumstances where easing the lockdown may be safe.This can be accessed on the Scottish Government website.

The population occupies breeding grounds eastwards from Scandinavia towards Siberia.The dotterel is unusual in that it turns the tables on traditional gender roles. The brightly-coloured females lead in courtship before leaving the smaller, drabber males to incubate the eggs and raise the young, and for this reason the species has been counted by the number of breeding males rather than pairs. There are only about - breeding males in the Uk.A new study published by Global Change Biology explores the potential ways that changing environmental conditions may be driving the decline and has found limited evidence that the decline in breeding is driven by climate change of dotterels.It research focuses on snow cover and nitrogen deposition. The amount of snow-cover is important for cold-adapted species of plants and animals.Fewer snow patches, around which dotterel feed, may lead to a reduction in peak insect abundance for chicks and cause unsuitable higher vegetation.Higher deposition of nitrogen tends to result in a reduction of alpine specialist plants, including species of mosses that form key breeding habitats for dotterel.Population declines and site abandonment by dotterel in Scotland during the last three decades have largely occurred at lower elevations, suggesting climate change may be the cause.However, the new study found relatively limited evidence that the decline in the breeding population is being driven by climatic factors on the breeding grounds, despite it previously being mooted as the primary reason.\"Climate change and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are widely regarded as important drivers of environmental change in alpine habitats. However, due to the dficulties working in high-elevation mountain systems, the impacts of these drivers on alpine breeding species have rarely been investigated,\" the study said.\"The Eurasian dotterelis a migratory wader, which has been the subject of uniquely long-term and spatially widespread monitoring effort in Scotland, where it breeds in alpine areas in dwindling numbers.\"Here we analyse data sets spanning three decades, to investigate whether key potential drivers of environmental change in Scottish mountainshave contributed to the population decline of dotterel.\"We also consider the role of rainfall on the species wintering grounds in North Africa.The study said: \"We found dotterel declines in both density and site occupancy of breeding males primarily occurred on low and intermediate elevation sites.\"High-elevation sites mostly continued to be occupied, but males occurred at lower densities in years following snow-rich winters, suggesting high-elevation snow cover displaced dotterel to lower sites.\"Wintering ground rainfall was positively associated with densities of breeding males two springs later.\"Dotterel densities were reduced at low and intermediate sites where nitrogen deposition was greatest, but not at high-elevation sites.\"While climatic factors explained iation in breeding density between years, they did not seem to explain the species uphill retreat and decline.ldquoWe cannot rule out the possibility that dotterel have increasingly settled on higher sites previously unavailable due to extensive snow cover, while changes associated with nitrogen deposition may also have rendered lower lying sites less suitable for breeding."},{"url":null,"title":"hs2-highlands-amazing-story-scots-railway-never","story":"Loch Broom, either dark and brooding or postcard pretty depending on your luck, provides a perfect view for visitors to relish as they wait for the red and black colours of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry to appear in the distance.Most will have arrived in one of Scotlandrsquos most treasured northwest coast spots by travelling the  miles of the A from Garve.The twisting road will have swept them up and down hills, past Ben Dearg and Ben Wyvis, alongside the Black Water river, Loch Droma and past the Glascarnoch Dam.Some might have stopped at Corrieshalloch Gorge,  miles east of Ullapool, parking just off the edge of the A-road to walk to the spectacular Falls of Measach.Of those who make that extra effort, most will almost certainly have stood on the ft suspension bridge that spans the gorge and provides a perfect view of the waterfall.Constructed by pioneering engineer Sir John Fowler, joint designer of the Forth Bridge and who created the worldrsquos first underground railway, the bridge sways gently as just six pedestrians at a time look over the ft drop.:Glasgow rail disruption as Highland cow blocks line between Busby and Pollokshaws WestAn ingenious construction of wire-rope cables, pylons and suspension rods, Fowlers bridge has stood the test of time ndash yet another symbol of good old Victorian engineering prowess.It is a skill for engineering which could, had history taken its own brief off-road detour, have completely transformed that far distant corner of Scotland.For had Fowler and a group of visionary colleagues had their way, it would not have been just that busy, winding road crammed with caravans, motor homes, trucks and cars that would have brought visitors and business to Ullapool.Instead, the route to that prized northwest corner, where tourists now flock to see glorious coastal scenery, dark lochs overlooked by dramatic hills and rolling moorland, might well have been via one of the most spectacular rail journeys in the world.It is  years ago this year since an Act of Parliament paved the way for the construction of an ambitious but achievable rail link that could have transformed Ullapool and brought a host of potential economic and social benefits.Devised by Fowler, his son Arthur and a group of well-heeled companions including Lady Mary Matheson of the Lews, widow of James Matheson, co-founder of Hong Kong-based conglomerate Jardine Matheson  Co and owner of the Isle of Lewis and much of Ullapool, the railway could have solved a longstanding problem: how to transport massive quantities of herring being landed by local fishermen to market as fast as possible.Steamships took too long. Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and .

In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

As I shovel, I am kept company by the old male pheasant that flits between our garden and those on either side, leaving gleaming feathers in the shrubbery, and shrieking like a klaxon, lest any of us ignore him. He has a limp, which might be the result of a run-in with the fox that snatched his partner. Certainly, he seems to enjoy company, as he struts among bluebells and tulips, before ducking under the chicken wire into the field, to view the newly arrived and still timid flock of sheep.The tools Irsquom using would have been familiar to the first settlers: a spade, fork, hand fork and trowel. Therersquos nothing mechanical in our shed. This is not for idealistic reasons but because, as absolute beginners, we are more neanderthal than digital. Only when we have some idea of what wersquore doing will it be safe to let high-powered tools loose around the place.Thanks to lockdown, parts of the back garden have been gone over more minutely than the dig at Pompeii. Every quarter of an hour I tip out another bucket of stones on to the cairn behind the woodshed. What began as a pimple is now half way to Ben Nevis. Some of the stones can be classied as boulders, which is where Alan comes in.I never thought of myself as having anything in common with Robert Burns, but discovering the ratio of stone to soil on your patch makes you realise what he and his brother had to contend with on Mossgiel farm, which was famously rocky and unyielding. As Irsquove worked over the earth, square foot at a time, the ground level has been gradually dropping, so that soon wersquoll have a sunken garden.Digging is good for letting the mind roam, but it leaves little energy for anything . While you can see how Burns might compose poetry during his rural drudgery, it is obvious why Seamus Heaney did not follow his family on to the farm. Among his most famous poems, and one of my favourites, is Digging, where he recalls watching his late father in the potato drills ndash ldquoBy God, the old man could handle a spade. The loss he still felt is palpable. Yet while he chose not to till the earth, like his brothers, he would instead use his pen as a spade, digging up ideas and his countryrsquos past.One of our neighbours spent years clearing their garden of rocks and detritus, more of which would surface whenever it rained. Among the tell-tale trophies they unearthed was a childrsquos school slate. I remember the weekend when I was a young girl when my father, digging, came upon a curved brick, and then another, eventually revealing a neat circle above the village spring, that had been filled in long ago. ldquoWell, well, well, he said. I still hope for such a find, but perhaps wersquove not been delving deep enough. All that has come to light so far has been fragments of china and pottery.The other evening, though, something interesting did turn up. I thought it was just a small animal bone but, after tossing it aside, retrieved it for a second look. Brushing off the earth, I found a hollowed-out flattish tube, with a pinhole opening at one end, stamped with neat letters. It was the stem of a clay pipe, the sort Silas Marner would have clamped between his teeth. Later, I found out it was from the Victorian pipe-making firm of William Christie, which operated in the Calton in Glasgow, from . A few years ago, the remains of the factory were excavated, including the kiln in which this pipe was very likely fired. Given that Christiersquos produced around , pipes a week, many of us probably have one under our feet.Irsquove always been fascinated by the things produced by metal detectorists or those with inquisitive dogs. Last week, I told Alan about the discovery of a ,-year-old Parthian warrior in Iran, whose teeth were in such good condition that a dentist who examined the skeleton said they were like implants. Alan was unimpressed, saying the real story was that theyrsquod been able to get hold of a dentist who, these days, are as rare as hensrsquo teeth.The clipping, mowing and shearing in Hoolet seems set to continue. While we all grow thatch, no weed or wild grass is allowed to rear its head. Only the village green has been letting the side down, turning into a meadow where the tip of squirrelsrsquo tails give away their position. Last weekend, a socially distanced posse resembling the Magnicent Seven set to work after a couple of hours of mowing, strimming, grass-gathering and edging, the green now looks fit for a game of bowls.Usually this is the councilrsquos job, a man with a sit-on mower and face mask whirling around the trees asdoing a cycling proficiency test. This year, however, an email sent to the council, asking when we could expect a mower, was met with a swt and polite reply. There would be no grass-cutting for a while, an official explained, because the men who normally do it are too busy digging graves."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-chef-paul-tamburrini-brings-latest-family-lockdown-feasts-table","story":"Cooking for his family has seen him develop new creations.Last year, Paul left his role at the Macdonald Holyrood Hotel in Edinburgh to embark on a culinary tour.Chicken and noodle broth, olive oil Serves Chicken stock - ingredients.K Chicken wings small white onion, finely diced  celery stock finely dicedSprig of thymeMethod - put the wings into a large pot and cover with cold water, drain and refresh with cold water - place over a medium heat and simmer, skim and discard any impurities that rise to the surface, add the onions, celery  thyme to the stock and turn the heat to a low settingContinue to simmer the stock carefully for around six hours - strain the stock through a fine sieve and refrigerateBroth ingredientsg fine noodles or you can also easily substitute with vermicelli  - litre Chicken stockml extra virgin olive oilCracked black pepperSoy sauce to tasteTo serveHeat up the chicken stock and pout over the fine noodles for  minutes  gently season.

Some % said they had been kept up to date with the latest news and developments.It comes as the Princes Trust called on government, businesses and charities to come together to prevent a youth jobs crisis and to ensure a generation doesnrsquot lose hope.Their research conducted during lockdown found over a quarterof  to -year olds in Scotland say their future career prospects have already been damaged and  per cent say it will be harder than ever to get a job.Last week, Richard Lochhead, the minister for further education, higher education and science in a message circulated to university and college students last week that there would be \"fair assessment\" principal.\"I recognise this will be an uncertain and dficult time for you all and I understand there has been a lot of concern about your exams and outstanding course work,\" he said.\"I have had the opportunity in recent weeks to discuss with Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the National Union of Studentshow qualications will be assessed in a fair way, based on internal assessments and graded units where possible. Across both sectors it is clear that the approach is underpinned by three important principles: fairness to all learners, safe and secure assessment whilst ensuring current public health advice is followed, and maintaining the integrity and credibility of our qualications. We must ensure that these standards are maintained over time, in the interests of learners.\"For university students, each university has adapted its approach to assessment in light of the pandemic, and has sought to reassure students that a principle of fairness will be applied across the board.\"NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: \"Students are facing unprecedented disruption to their studies as a result of the lockdown, with our research showing that seven in ten students are concerned about the effect of Covid- on their final qualication.\"We welcome the statement from the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science committing to fair assessment and expect all institutions to ensure students are treated fairly. NUS Scotland believes institutions should adopt a no-detriment approach to assessment, so no student is academically disadvantaged as a result of this pandemic.\"The newly released NUS Scotland survey of over  students between March  and April  covering a range of responses to the coronavirus crisis found that seven in ten students wanted further information or guidance from governments about how their course or degree will be graded or awarded and two in three said they needed more clarity over how this years work will be assessed.Some % were extremely or very concerned over the impact of coronavirus on their exams while a further % were concerned.Two in three either disagreed, strongly disagreed or were neutral about whether their institution was managing the crisis well.Nearly  signed a petition over the past month calling for the University of the West of Scotland to implement a a no-detriment policy for end of year exams due the Covid- outbreak.It said: \"This means that any work submitted towards their final grade will only improve it and not bring down degree classications due to circumstances that are out-with our control.\"During this time it is unreasonable for the university to expect students to carry on as normal and risk the current situation impact four years or hard work. We want to work with the university to ensure that exam are implemented fairly and that no student is disadvantaged.\"UWS has since put out a statement saying that it \"seeks to ensure no detriment\" due to the pandemic whilst \"maintaining the integrity of their higher education journey\".Some students have continued to questioned whether this is no-detriment, saying they are losing out.The university was asked whether their policy ensures that all students affected will automatically have their degree grade frozen, meaning they can only improve on it - but did not directly respond, preferring to direct a prepared statement.Terri Henderson, a fourth year Honours events management student at UWS raised concerns about the university policy with the institutions management saying she felt there had been no progression on implementing the policy from the university other than an email saying that the university was aware that students were anxious and that the they were working on a fair approach.She was concerned that the university were using the \"no-detriment\" in its statement - but in reality did not have a policy that any new work submitted could only raise the degree classication and would not bring it down.\"I am angry about it. I have sent multiple emails and getting no thing back.\"They say no-detriment but it is not no-detriment, as is not standardised with the rest of the educational institutions.\"I was at my grandmothers funeral today , horrible, and I was still being expected to submit work that is going to go to my degree last week, while dealing with all this.\"Glasgow universities managed to bring out their no detriment policies between March  and April  - ours was not released till April .\"Some students are not passing through no fault of their own. Grades absolutely are being affected.\"The NUS Scotland analysis revealed that three in four students had a vocation element to their course, and of those, three quarters believed the Covid- outbreak would have a negative impact on that element of their studies.And of those who received learning support from their institution, just over half feel they have received adequate support to enable them to continue their work to the best of their ability throughout the Covid- pandemic.The analysis also revealed financial concerns during the pandemic.Four in five students were concerned about their ability to manage financially during the Covid- outbreak while one in four were \"very\" or \"extremely\" concerned. Three in four were concerned to some extent about their ability to pay their bills.Two in five have cut back on food spending to make ends meet.Three in five felt that the UK government had adequately considered the dficulties students faces as a result of the crisis while almost half agreed the Scottish Government were acting in their best interests.A Universities Scotland said spokesman said: ldquoIn recent weeks principals have been in close touch with NUS Scotland and their own student associations to understand studentsrsquo worries about the pandemicrsquos impact on end of year assessment.\"Wersquore in agreement that a principle of fairness for students should underpin all decisions universities take when adapting academic regulations around assessment because of coronavirus.\"Universities will each set their own policy on assessment, as was the case before the pandemic, and they are also mindful of the need for academic thresholds and the integrity of the qualications they offer, but students should be reassured that fairness will apply across the board. The best advice is for students to check the policy at their institution.A UWS spokesman said: ldquoWe are committed to ensuring a fair and reasonable approach to assessment, progression and degree classication for all students, and take a compassionate approach to the current circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic. Our priority remains to support students and seek to ensure no detriment due to the pandemic whilst maintaining the integrity of their higher education journey.Meanwhile in response to the the Princes Trust and YouGov report, Young People in Lockdown Kate Still, director of The Princersquos Trust in Scotland said: ldquoThis paints a truly stark picture of how the coronavirus crisis is impacting young people. An alarming proportion of young people are feeling increased levels of anxiety, and fears are building about their future.ldquoWe cannot allow this crisis to cripple the aspirations and prospects of our nationrsquos young people.

For a long time, most Scotstook the constitution for granted. Independence was a minority interest and many Scotswould casually vote SNP for ious local or strategic reasons without any sense of independence being a threat ndash in fact, wersquod vote SNP without independence really crossing our minds.In retrospect, that seems remarkable, but thatrsquos how it was. I once asked the former Scottish secretary Malcolm Rkind why the constitution wasnrsquot a bigger issue  or  years ago and why devolutionists like him werenrsquot pushing harder for change and his answer made sense. It just wasnrsquot dominating Scottish politics, said Sir Malcolm, andit was, why werenrsquot , people marching down the street demanding reform Of course, they are marching nowand a lot of Scots have found the whole thing stressful. I suspect many unionists are, by nature, cautious people and instinctively prefer the status quo, so change or constant agitation for change is uncomfortable for them. Theyrsquove been trapped in the back of the car while their parents bicker and squabble in the front ndash and we never reach our destination.Which is why, politically, the last few weeks have been a relief for many unionists. Broadly, the Scottish and UK governments have followed the same policy on coronavirusand Nicola Sturgeon has struck a collegiate tone. Shersquos also appeared to pull back from her usual approach of emphasising dferences with Westminster, which, I suspect, is one reason her coronavirus approval rating is high among Tory and Labour voters as well as nationalists.:Scots trust Holyrood to stop new virus wave, but not WestminsterThere are some Tories and unionists, however, who seem to want the alignment between Holyrood and Westminster to continue at all times. For example, the Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw questioned why Ms Sturgeon did not move from the ldquostay at home slogan at the same time as the Prime Minster, the implication being she was up to her old tricks of looking for dferences with Westminster for the sake of it.But firstly, the First Minister was right to be dubious about ldquostay alert: itrsquos a rubbish slogan. Secondly, she has worked closely with the UK Government ndash the SNPrsquos Mike Russell pointed out how extraordinary the co-operation is on coronavirus given the stand-off on everything . And thirdly, to expect Scotland to align with the UK at all times is a bad idea, not only because the virus ies regionally but because total alignment misunderstands devolution. The SNP may have been guilty of seeking dference for the sake of it, but some unionists have been guilty of the opposite offence: seeking sameness for the sake of it.What devolution shows is that the reality is in the middle and that dference within the UK is a necessary and desirable part of the system. Indeed, it was part of the case for a Scottish Parliament in the first place that it would be dferent from Westminster. It was said, for instance, that a less adversarial approach would be fostered by the U-shaped chamber and a high number of female MSPs. Then along came a female MSP from Irvine who was inspired to enter politics by a female MP from Grantham. Bang goes that theory.But in other ways, Holyroodrsquos dference to Westminster has been critical to its development. When he was first minister, Labourrsquos Henry McLeish pursued policies irrespective of whether they were dferent from the rest of the UK, on free personal care for the elderly for instance. But part of the reason for Labourrsquos decline in Scotland was that his successor Jack McConnell avoided policies that might create dferences with the leadership in London. It also explains the success of the SNP. Most people donrsquot value dference for the sake of it, but dference when necessary became a way to judge Scotlandrsquos politicians.At least initially, Alex Salmond seemed to understand this when he succeeded Mr McConnell. The emphasis of the SNPrsquos first administration in particular was on being responsible and competent in government, although Mr Salmond was not scared of taking off his jacket and having a fight with London when he thought he needed to.But somewhere along the line, mainly because of the  referendum, this balance between dference and responsibility was lost. The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon knew being dferent to London was popular with a large swathe of voters and in that sense reversed what Henry McLeish did. Mr McLeish pursued policies irrespective of dferences with the rest of the UK, whereas it often felt like the SNP pursued dferences with the rest of the UK irrespective of the policies.:Coronavirus: Politicians and facility bosses say Scottish Government must follow rest of the UK in care home testingTo some extent, coronavirus has re-tuned the parameters again. Nicola Sturgeon has been competent and responsible during the crisis and it was only when the PM, not the FM, changed tack in England that dferences emerged. Not only is this how devolution is meant to be ndash regional dferences when judged necessary by the dferent leaders ndash I suspect itrsquos how most voters would like it to be. We donrsquot want to be the same as England for the sake of it, and we donrsquot want to be dferent for the sake of it, we want to be dferent to England when itrsquos right for Scotland.In that sense, dference is a good thing and nothing to be scared of, even for unionists. The problem is that a few of the most committed unionists, and Tories in particular, seem to view any dference as bad or an SNP plot rather than part of the process. Earlier, I summed up the s with one word ndash chaos ndash but chaos and dference are not necessarily the same thing. Dference done the right way ndash the way itrsquos been done under coronavirus ndash is part of devolution. The aim is dference thatrsquos dynamic but respectful. Itrsquos dference when needed but not for the sake of it. Itrsquos devolution done properly.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Edinburgh IJB, which was unable to set a balanced budget last year until October due to the financial constraints it found itself in, was drawing up pound.m of saving plans for this year. In Glasgow, officials identied a pound million funding gap and almost pound million of ldquopressures.In March, Renfrewshire IJB agreed to hold back pound, of money set to be used for drug and alcohol services ldquofor the health and social care partnership to draw down in support of its transformation programme.But the financial situation across Scotland was thrown into more turmoil as health and social care became the front line for dealing with the Covid- pandemic.Aberdeenshire IJB warned there was now ldquoless focus on financial management due to the situation ndash while East Ayrshire IJB stressed that ldquoextraordinary costs are being incurred and will continue to be incurred for the foreseeable future. Officials also say they ldquomay require to consider emergency budget measures as the impact, financially and operationally of mobilisation and response to Covid- are better understood.Many boards are working on the ldquoassumption that the Scottish Government will step in and cover the additional costs.Scottish Conservative health spokesperson, Miles Briggs, said: ldquoIJBs will be more important than ever in the coming months for delivering social care in each local authority and implementing measures to keep care home residents safe.ldquoAcross Scotland, IJBs have been forced to make cuts to their budgets because of decisions made by SNP ministers and now it is unclear what is happening with money made available to the Scottish Government, through Barnett consequentials, that was meant for councils.He added: ldquoSNP ministers must urgently review the funding deal that they have with local authorities and health boards, so that they are in a position to effectively deal with Covid- and its aftermath.ldquoCuts to local authority funding have a knock on effect to funding available for third sector organisations who provide invaluable care for vulnerable people in the community, which will be so vital in the coming months.Liberal Democrats have also called for more support to be offered from the Scottish Government.Lib Dem health spokesperson, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said: ldquoJoint boards are in a very tough position. The Scottish Government promised they would have a groundbreaking impact on health and social care but they have consistently faced challenges over finances and the flow of patients through the health service even before Covid- arrived.ldquoThe last thing we need is a further budgetary crisis in the midst of the virus crisis. The Scottish Government must ensure that joint boards have the support and resources they need to do their jobs.Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that healthcare will continue to be a priority of the Scottish Government once the country emerges from the emergency situation.She said: ldquoThe financial implications of this virus are going to be felt in almost every area of our lives. We have a duty and a responsibility to manage this and to protect what matters most. As we found out with this pandemic, it has been reinforced, there are few things that matter more than health and caring for the health of the population.ldquoWe will work with health boards, we will work with IJBs. We have been very clear with health boards and local authorities that financial constraints should not be affecting how we deal with this crisis right now.Ms Sturgeon added: ldquoAs we go into a recovery phase, as we start to resume more routine healthcare, these discussions will continue ndash so that we can ensure that we have the ability and the capacity to deal with this virus, which we are going to have to continue to do for quite some time to come, but also the day-to-day health needs of all people across the country.ldquoNone of these issues are going to be straightforward or easy for any government anywhere in the world to deal with but we have a good foundation here in Scotland and will continue to make sure that we work in a responsible way that is about protectiing the things that matter most to us.COSLA, the umbrella organisation for Scottish local authorities, has warned that frontline care, waiting times and peoplersquos mental health are being put on the line when officials are not handed enough money to provide services.A COSLA spokesperson said: ldquoAs we said in our essential services document for the recent spending review, the risks of not investing in local government include increased costs in acute care and hospital waiting times, social isolation and depression when older people canrsquot continue to live in their own community.ldquoWell-being is about much more than investment in the NHS ndash itrsquos about investing in the social determinants of health and wider public health ndash the everyday services that enhance the lives of iniduals, families and communities.

The community will hopefully then be able to engage with it and get involved with its long-term legacy.ldquoSadly for the public, itrsquos not accessible at the moment, but these proposals change this.He added: ldquoFrom our point of view,it was a unique opportunity to get involved and assist the current family owners to safeguard a piece of local history for future generations that was very important to them.ldquoOur proposals use the castle as the main focal point of our proposed development, where we have createda bouled of  houses leadingto the castle that frames the castlersquos north elevation.ldquoThis proposal re-engages the castle with its surroundings and, more importantly, allows the public the opportunity to visit and view the castle up close.Gilbertfield, which once formed part of the barony of Drumsargard, was bought in  by Sir John Cunningham of Easter Moffat. He built an imposing residence at the foot of Dechmont Hillrsquos northern slope, carving the date  above one of the windows on the eastern wall.Despite its impressive original appearance, the buildingrsquos condition deteriorated steadily after the arable Westburn and Gilbertfield estate was sold in  to trustees of the deceased Adam Graham of Craigallan. By the middle of the th century, it had become dilapidated, with swallowsand starlings making their nests in empty rooms.At the time it was inhabited by gamekeeper Joseph Kirby who, in , was shot and killed on the lands by Andrew Forrest, a young blacksmith from Glasgow.During his murder trial, Forrest maintained he was set upon by a dog Kirby had trained to attack trespassers. The bullet that killed the gamekeeper, he claimed, was meant for the animal.A sympathetic jury ed a not proven verdict and Forrest walked free.Local youths also contributed to Gilbertfieldrsquos sorry state. In May , four men from the Cambuslang area were charged with having maliciously destroyed and pulled down itssouth bastion.In their defence the accused claimed to have spotted a stone sticking out from the buildingrsquos turret. Considering it hazardous, they obtained a rope and removed the object, pulling to the ground a mass of surrounding material. They were each fined pound.Mr Johnston said highlighting Gilbertfieldrsquos rich past would be a key element within the project.ldquoAs well as restoring it as a monument to safeguard it for future generations, we have proposed information boards around grounds of the castle and conveying its history, he said.ldquoThis is important because there are lots of people in the Cambuslang Gilbertfield area who recall it from their childhood, or playing in the surrounding fields.Mr Johnston also said extensive work would be required to stabilise the existing stonework.ldquoThere are large cracks in certain gables that need attention soonerrather than later, he said.ldquoProposed works include stone repair, mortar reinstatement, tidyingup of debris within the monumentarea itself and, as previously mentioned, installation of new interpretation boards for visitors within thecastlersquos grounds.ldquoThe main aspect of our proposal is about making the castle accessible again to the public so they canwalk freely up to it and engagewith it.ldquoPre-application discussions [with South Lanarkshire Council] havegone very well so far and wersquore hopeful of a positive outcome

But it will be a journey to a better balance, I hope, than the one we have today.#As we take each step, we must make sure the ground beneath us is as solid as possible.#And that’s why, between now and then, sticking with the lockdown restrictions a bit longer, to suppress the virus more, is so important.#Because that will mean we can start to take these steps with confidence that we have alternative means of effectively keeping it under control.#So for that reason, our key advice now remains unchanged, and it remains as important as ever.#Please stay at home right now except for essential purposes — such as essential work that can’t be done at home, exercise, or accessing essential items like food and medicine.#By sticking with these restrictions now, we make it all the more likely we can start that journey back to normality within the timescale I talked about a moment.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It ends free movement. It takes back control of our borders.ldquoIt gives the Government the powers needed to deliver an immigration system that is firm, fair and fit for the future, the points-based system the public voted for, a system that will support our economic recovery by prioritising jobs for people here in the UK while continuing to attract the brightest and the best in terms of global talent. vw,vw,px, px\"Home Secretary Priti Patel But Mr Thomas-Symonds said: ldquoIn the midst of this crisis the Government is putting forward an immigration system containing a salary threshold of pound, ndash it sends a signal and tells people that anyone earning less than that is unskilled and unwelcome in our country.Mr Thomas-Symonds said the earnings of frontline workers do not reflect their contribution to society, adding: ldquoThose who clappedon Thursday are only too happy to vote through a Bill today that will send a powerful message to those same people ndash that they are not considered by this Government to be skilled workers.ldquoAre shop workers unskilled  Are refuse collectors  Are local government workers  Are NHS staff  Are care workers  Of course they are not.SNP immigration spokesman Stuart McDonald criticised the ldquodreadful Bill, saying: ldquoItrsquos a Bill that will result in many thousands of EU nationals losing their rights in this country overnight and which will extend the reach of the hostile environment still further.Yvette Cooper, Labour chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, said she believes the Bill is ldquoflawed, but that immigration legislation is needed and she will put forward amendments which she hopes will receive cross-party support.She went on: ldquoIn that cross-party spirit I will not vote against the Bill tonight, althoughthe Governmentrsquos approach does not change, I would expect to oppose it when it s to the House. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour MP Diane Abbott Labourrsquos Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, said the Bill is ldquobad in principle, bad in practice and described it as a ldquoslap in the face for the thousands of migrants, including EU migrants, working so hard for the NHS and care sector in this time of Covid crisis.In February, the Government announced proposals for the new system, with points awarded for specic requirements such as being able to speak English to a certain level, having a job offer from an approved employer and meeting a salary threshold of pound,.Other points could be awarded for certain qualications andthere is a shortage in a particular occupation.A visa allowing doctors, nurses and health professionals from overseas to work in the NHS was introduced in March.copy -.

I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place.

The Faroes is effectively covid free, whereas the UK has the highest death rate in Europe. Set up a phone line or web page where people who are symptomatic can register. Depending on numbers follow up with testing and contact tracing. It will also show distribution throughout the isles and clusters. Inter-island ferries as well as those to mainland Scotland are essential travel only. The NHS tracking app will not work in remote areas with poor mobile coverage in addition to its multiple other failings. The NHS video conferencing software will not work in areas with poor broadband and is unstable. The proposed quarantine for international arrivals is only  days. People have been under mandatory house arrest for nearly  months, and some of the smaller isles may not have been infected in the first place.I fully agree with taking a geographical approach to lting the lock up. If an area is clear and the R rate is zero then civil liberties should be reinstated.Maybe the Scottish government is frightened to takeresponsibility tolt the lock up because then they won#t be able topoint the finger at the UK government for making mistakes .Looking on the bright side, this could be the start of the downfall of the SNP and their anti democratic way of governance. #Freedom# shouted the Aussie.We seem to have a politics driven Headless-Chiken approach in Scotland.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

One of Northern Ireland#s top GPs explained that community pharmacists could also be used during the flu season, while help may be needed from the Department of Health to administer the jabs.Dr George O#Neill said the flu season is just months away and plans must be in place to deliver flu jabs sooner rather than later.Outlining the looming danger that could be realised this winter, Dr O#Neill compared Covid- to the Spanish flu pandemic in .The second wave of that virus hit during the winter months and claimed more lives than the first.If you combine the normal natural flu -you can call it normal - plus Covid-, a double whammy will hit us towards the end of this year so the flu jab is going to be crucially important, he said.Towards the beginning of the winter we#re going to have to administer the flu jabs andthere#s still ongoing problems, which I#m sure there will be, we#re going to have to think of a new way of doing this.We#re throwing ideas around about the flu jabs. Drive-thrus could be a possibility and maybe working with community pharmacists. We have to think of dferent ways of doing this.Rather than putting it off, it should be faced up to now and we should have some idea about where we#re going to be.We#re halfway through May and it#s in September and October when we start to consider giving flu jabs.GPs have already recommenced baby vaccinations and immunisations but the lack of personal protective equipment- mainly face masks - is an ongoing concern.Dr O#Neill, who is the joint chair of the West Belfast GP Federation, believes that the mother of the child should also be wearing face masks.We need so many face masks becauseyou have maybe  babies a week coming in with the mother, the mother should, in my view, wear a face mask, he said.Everybody should be treated as a suspected Covid- carrier.These are things GPs are thinking about at the moment and certainly in both the North and West Belfast GP Federations, we have set up a small sub-group to look at how we can start moving back into the normal world again.Dr O#Neill said changes in the healthcare system that have occurred since the outbreak of the virus would normally have taken years.One of the main positives to have come from the crisis is the increased use of video and telephone consultations with patients. Dr O#Neill has called this development a major game changer.He explained that in some areas, hospitals can carry out % of their post-operation consultations through telephone calls or online video conferencing with a patient.As part of that effort, patients have been encouraged to buy their own blood pressure monitors and pulse oximeters so they can pass on the results to their GP.With video and telephone consultations there is no going back, said Dr O#Neill. This is here to stay and patients like it because it#s quicker.If you ring up you#ll have a response with you within a day.It saves the patient a visit to the hospital, it means we can deal with patients quicker and it#s better all round for everybody concerned.It#s a win-win situation and it#s a major game changer.There#s a positive that will come out this and also new ways of working.What has happened in the last seven to eight weeks has been incredible.The changes that have occurred would have taken years but things have happened quickly and rapidly.Everybody has been working together and towards the same aim. Everyone is looking for the same outcome.There are positives to this, it#s not all doom and gloom.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It all became possible after The Church Mouse shop in Enniskillen received a consignment of defective shirts prior to the lockdown.The manager of the East Bridge Street store, which is run by Enniskillen Presbyterian Church, then thought it might be possible to use them in the quest for PPE.And that is when Eleanor Harpur enlisted an army of volunteers to turn the sub-standard shirts into scrubs for two Northern Ireland hospitals and care homes in the Republic.Quite some time ago we received a large boxed up consignment of white shirts with minor defects that you wouldn#t have noticed, she said.A large number of boxes had been sent to Operation Rescue in Ethiopia and we were able to sell some in the shop, but we still had a lot left over when we had to close in March because of the lockdown.Watching the news one night I wondered whether they would be of any use to the NHS at this anxious time.Eleanor asked two church members, Alison and Gordon Annan, for guidance as the latter had already helped to distribute PPE across Ireland with the help of fellow bikers known as #Bikers Coming Through#.Gordon told me the shirts, almost , of them, could be altered and made into scrubs, which was great news, she said.As a result Gordon delivered  shirts to Margaret Houston of NI Scrubs, a seamstress in Dromore, Co Tyrone, whose team of  home-working machinists removed the collars and cuffs.They sewed a V-shaped neckline cut into the front and made other alternations, which included sewing on pockets, to produce scrubs for the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen.Eleanor told how another  shirts went to Co Kildare by van, where Gordon met up with fellow bikers for the onward journey to Co Kerry and machinists there to make more scrubs for care homes in the area.She added that the final  shirts went to the machinists in Dromore again, where they were altered for use in the new Nightingale hospital in Belfast.Eleanor said the delivery of the defective shirts was an example of God working in mysterious ways.Little did we know, when we received this large consignment of shirts, how useful they would actually become, she said.We are so grateful that we have been able to play a small part in helping those who are doing so much for us all.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ards and North Down Borough Council will furlough about .Derry City and Strabane and Fermanagh and Omagh District Councils will each furlough about . Mid and East Antrim Borough Council will temporarily lay off , and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council . Of those councils, some are still negotiating with unions whether to top up workers# wages.Alison Millar, Nipsa#s general secretary, said one was proposing to furlough staff on % of their normal salary.She added: While Nipsa obviously welcomes the decision by the Communities Minister [Deirdre Hargey] to ensure that councils could furlough workers under the scheme, we have concerns that some jobs may be at risk in the short to medium-term. It#s imperative that all councils are proposing to furlough their workers must do so on the basis that they will fund the additional %. This is signicant issue as some of these workers are on the national minimum wage.Antrim and Newtownabbey councillors voted on May  to furlough  workers on full pay until May , when they will be paid at the Government rate of %. The council said it was losing £, each month and faced a £.m shortfall this financial year. Of the  staff the council had considered making redundant,  will now be furloughed.SDLP councillor Ryan Wilson said the decision had spared the council from making hundreds of redundancies, but he was disappointed staff wouldn#t have their pay topped up, as other councils had done.He added: The council is clearly under financial pressure and the Minister for Communities must make additional funding available to ensure ratepayers do not bear this burden, either by a large increase of rates or a depletion of services.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council said it expected to lose about £m this financial year, but had no plans to cut back services. It added: To be in a position to sustain service levels into the future and emerge with a feasible long-term plan for economic recovery, greater financial assistance from central government will be required.Meanwhile, Mid Ulster District Council said furloughing just over a third of its workforce would reduce April losses from £, to just over £,.Solace NI, the body of council chief executives, warned last week that local authorities here could run out of cash for staff and suppliers within monthsthey did not get the support they needed.Belfast Most ReadOfficer draws his gun in confrontation with man during Belfast house searchKieran Wylie shot dead in front of two daughters in Belfast home, police revealGrieving Ryan Smyth says focus now on little Hannah after death of we Clare and daughter Bethany Community gathers to remember Clare and Bethany Smyth after quad bike tragedy Seven struggling Northern Ireland councils furlough nearly , staff,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tuesday saw the ninth edition of the County Derry Post without a match report, without an athletics update and without any kind of preview. Getting bogged down in feature and nostalgia pieces gives sports journalists the opportunity to chat with characters and legends from yesteryear. It is the perfect therapy. Living and working in isolation, is just how le is at the moment. You appreciate a daily run and the chirping birds all the more. Every day seems the same, but some things are dotted in to keep the week structured. googletag.cmd.push Joe McCloskey hosts a zoom quiz for our circle of friends, so that means it is Saturday at .pm. Fr Doherty delivers mass via the webcam, so that means it is Sunday morning at . and proofing pages means it is Monday and deadline time. Our daughter Erins school, St Brigids   Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted in Tirkane, have been excellent at rolling out enough work to keep her engaged. I play Muacuteinteoir Daidaiacute and set out a few tasks. Not a lot, but just enough to maintain some sort of structure. There is so much out there that is learning, the practical stuff. My we Pauline took her on a nature walk to pick wild flowers for a May altar. Granny Sally is teaching her how to grow tomatoes and the treehouse, crafted by Granda Mickey, is getting well tested. And all the teddies made an appearance in the garden to make a zoo, as shown in the picture above. googletag.cmd.push It is just great to be able to spend time with your family. Then one evening came a statement that just stopped me in my tracks. “Daddy, when this is all over, can we go to that Kitchen place in Magherafelt for a chocolate milkshake,” Erin asked. Her this is the coronavirus and she is talking about Shorty McNallyscafe, a hub of chat. Erin always get a milkshake and I get the half and half with chicken curry that always hits the spot. Erin follows up: “Daddy...when will this all be over ” “I dont know pet,” comes my answer. And I dont. I feel tiny and helpless. At this stage, the penny drops. What must be going on in their wee heads  The schoolwork is irrelevant. They will all catch-up sometime. A cuddle and some reassurance that you are there for them is more important. Every Thursday night, a round of applause is dedicated to those working in the NHS and on front line. But me, my thoughts are also dedicated to the children out there. They have also been thrust into a whole world of uncertainty. God love them. One thing is certain though...Shortys next serving of milkshake and curry will never taste better.

As revealed by the Derry News earlier this month, the proposed bridge would span an intake of water near the Fort George site, expanding the Quay Trail into Bay Road park. The planning application was received by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Service on March  and is in the early stages of consideration. The proposed bridge will provide a link from the city centre to Muff in County Donegal. It is part of the wider North West Greenway Network project which aims to develop .km of cross-border greenway, including: Derry-Buncrana, Derry-Muff, and Lford-Strabane. googletag.cmd.push  Funding for the project has been provided through the EU’s INTERREG VA programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body . Match-funding has been provided by the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport in Ireland. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, welcomed the submission of the planning application. She said: “I am delighted this key infrastructure project, which will complement the emerging City Deal riverfront regeneration plans, has reached this important milestone. Subject to planning approval, it will play a signicant role in connecting people through our infrastructure, facilitating more people to get outdoors and choose sustainable travel options, whilst benefitting peoples’ health and wellbeing.” googletag.cmd.push Paying tribute to everyone involved for advancing project development during this emergency period, Mayor Boyle continued: “Now, more than ever, there is a real need for investment in projects which encourage a more active, healthy lestyle. Once completed, the proposed new bridge will further enhance the City and District’s growing greenway network.” Gina McIntyre, Chief Executive of SEUPB said: “This bridge is an integral section of the North West Greenway Network’s route , which will link Derry to Muff. It will encourage more people to choose an eco-friendly form of travel, one of the core objectives of the EU’s INTERREG VA Programme, which has been designed to support more sustainable forms of transport, on both sides of the border.” She continued: ”It is also important, as we emerge from COVID- restrictions in the coming weeks and months, that we rebuild our society and the economy in a more environmentally-conscious way. This greenway will help support a more socially distanced recovery process, an approach that will pay real and tangible idends for us all in the future.” Further details on the project can be found at www.nwgreenway.

It will allow the first student intake of  in September , she explained, this is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. Speaking after todays Executive announcement where it agreed to establish medical school in Derry and the first student intake of  students in September, MLA for Foyle Karen Mullan said:Todays announcement by the Executive that it plans to establish the graduate medical school at Magee is a major boost for Ulster University and for Derry. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of this investment to the economic regeneration of Derry and to the North West cannot be overstated. I warmly welcome the decision which adds quite signicantly to the City Deals and Inclusive Future Fund commitment announced in recent weeks too. “There is widespread support for the medical school and the expansion of Magee. There is a united voice in the city at political and community levels and todays announcement represents a huge step forward towards the goal of delivering the medical school at Magee in the fastest time possible. Sinn Feacutein is committed to working with Ulster University, local business leaders and all other parties to see the project delivered without any delay. googletag.cmd.push While welcoming the Executive recommitting itself to a medical school as part of the expansion of Magee, SDLP Leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood called for further detail and guarantees on a September  intake. Mr Eastwood said that what’s needed now is more than warm words but a detailed plan and the resource needed to lt the project off the ground. Colum Eastwood MP said: “During the negotiations to restore power sharing, I made it a personal priority to secure not just a political commitment to the expansion of Magee but resource for developing the medical school. That was critical to SDLP support for the Executive. I welcome the statement from the First Ministers recommitting to university expansion in Derry today. “What people here need is more than warm words or restated promises. We need a guarantee from the Executive and from Ulster University that the first students will enrol starting in September  and we need to see a plan for university expansion beyond that. The medical school is the first step, not the end product. “I will work constructively with all parties to deliver on the potential of our university. Providing young people with the opportunity to study, work and make a le for themselves here is a priority for me. Today’s news must be something genuinely new, rehashing previous commitments or announcements will not be enough. Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said all parties have worked hard to secure the medical school. Mr Middleton said: “Enhanced commitment from the Executive for the graduate medical school is very welcome. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. During the Confidence and Supply Agreement, Gregory Campbell was able to bring the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to the City to show him the potential. Indeed, with support across the British Isles, this key project has been able to be moved in the right direction. It is a symbol of what can be done when people work together. I hope in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” The British Government backed a medical school in Derry in the New Decade, New Approach document. Former Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal also welcomed the news saying: Great news for Derry - such great community commitment to this project - well done to all involved in the campaign. A new decade and a new approach to ALL parts of Northern Ireland being delivered.

It will allow the first student intake of  in September , she explained, this is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. Speaking after todays Executive announcement where it agreed to establish medical school in Derry and the first student intake of  students in September, MLA for Foyle Karen Mullan said:Todays announcement by the Executive that it plans to establish the graduate medical school at Magee is a major boost for Ulster University and for Derry. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of this investment to the economic regeneration of Derry and to the North West cannot be overstated. I warmly welcome the decision which adds quite signicantly to the City Deals and Inclusive Future Fund commitment announced in recent weeks too. “There is widespread support for the medical school and the expansion of Magee. There is a united voice in the city at political and community levels and todays announcement represents a huge step forward towards the goal of delivering the medical school at Magee in the fastest time possible. Sinn Feacutein is committed to working with Ulster University, local business leaders and all other parties to see the project delivered without any delay. googletag.cmd.push While welcoming the Executive recommitting itself to a medical school as part of the expansion of Magee, SDLP Leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood called for further detail and guarantees on a September  intake. Mr Eastwood said that what’s needed now is more than warm words but a detailed plan and the resource needed to lt the project off the ground. Colum Eastwood MP said: “During the negotiations to restore power sharing, I made it a personal priority to secure not just a political commitment to the expansion of Magee but resource for developing the medical school. That was critical to SDLP support for the Executive. I welcome the statement from the First Ministers recommitting to university expansion in Derry today. “What people here need is more than warm words or restated promises. We need a guarantee from the Executive and from Ulster University that the first students will enrol starting in September  and we need to see a plan for university expansion beyond that. The medical school is the first step, not the end product. “I will work constructively with all parties to deliver on the potential of our university. Providing young people with the opportunity to study, work and make a le for themselves here is a priority for me. Today’s news must be something genuinely new, rehashing previous commitments or announcements will not be enough. Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said all parties have worked hard to secure the medical school. Mr Middleton said: “Enhanced commitment from the Executive for the graduate medical school is very welcome. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. During the Confidence and Supply Agreement, Gregory Campbell was able to bring the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond to the City to show him the potential. Indeed, with support across the British Isles, this key project has been able to be moved in the right direction. It is a symbol of what can be done when people work together. I hope in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” The British Government backed a medical school in Derry in the New Decade, New Approach document. Former Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal also welcomed the news saying: Great news for Derry - such great community commitment to this project - well done to all involved in the campaign. A new decade and a new approach to ALL parts of Northern Ireland being delivered.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation. Are the GPA going to be able to pay himhe stays at home  I wouldnt think so and Derry will not be able to pay him to stay in separate accommodation between games.As regards testing. A GAA player could be tested on a Monday to seehe is able to train and pick up the virus after that. His test could come back clear and he could infect the rest of the  and the opposition come the following Sunday.It just isnt feasible. If it is not safe for supporters to attend games, then players are the same.Watching the Bundesliga this weekend should be a reminder to decision makers of how a country can benefit from acting early and in a calculated manner.Us sporting addicts, we will just have to keep watching it on television. When the time comes to , it needs to be the right time...not just a rushed job. We deserve as much. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Irish rugby tour postponed. More...

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

With thousands more claimants now trying to access welfare support – many for the first time – the pressure on local advice services has never been higher. Applications have sky rocketed, as employers struggle to source support for employees as well as secure the long-term future of their business, and families seek aid as they face the sudden stark reality of le without a regular income. googletag.cmd.push The community and voluntary sector in Derry has mobilised to provide a network of support, and one vital component in that resilience effort are the local advice service organisations who are providing round the clock guidance and information for those in most dficulty. They have seen a surge in demand for information on support mechanisms such as the Job Retention Scheme, Self-employment Income Support, Statutory Sick Pay, Universal Credit and mortgage advice. Jacqueline Gallagher is manager of the newly branded Advice North West – formerly Citizens Advice Bureau. Used to dealing face to face with their customers, they have been adjusting to the challenge of working remotely assisting people by email and phone and the limitations that brings. googletag.cmd.push Weve been so busy since we entered lockdown, it is a time of great uncertainty for many in our communities with a large volume of iniduals and families worried about their security of income, housing and employment, she explains. We have dealt with a large influx of people who have had to access the benefit system for the first time. “This can be a time-consuming process at any time but with the inability to provide face to face advice services we have had to be inventive in our approach to surmount the current social constraints and limitations. Its very tough for people who have never before had to navigate the benefit system and are now having to do so in such unexpected and upsetting circumstances. “They are afraid of not being able to pay back debts, losing their homes, not being able to feed their families – its an unbelievably anxious time. “The dficulty is that everyones situation is dferent, so each person needs a specially tailored approach. Our team dedicates themselves to ensuring the wellbeing of those who access our services. Jude McKinney is the Welfare Rights Manager of the Resource Centre Derry where the team has also been adjusting to new ways of working introduced to fast track services that are under increasing pressure. It really has been a challenge for our team, he admits. We definitely saw a major spike in demand for services at the start as we had a lot of new issues to deal with. We received advance funding from Council and we have been allocated additional money through the Community Fund which helped us to meet this initial demand for services. We anticipated having to cover a lot of additional hours to allow for the extra filling out of forms. “When we first entered lockdown we saw a huge surge in claims for things like employment benefit, self-employment support and the self-isolation job retention scheme. “Then when the furloughing scheme was announced – something which no one was familiar with – it was another challenge helping both employers and employees understand how the scheme works to benefit them. We can no longer facilitate face to face appointments which is in itself challenging and we anticipated it would mean a lot of extra out of hours work for our staff. But thankfully there have been some fantastic measures introduced by the Department for Communities in terms of easement. They stepped in to introduce a number of easement mechanisms including a six-month extension of payments for existing claims, which has meant we havent had to process a huge volume of renewal forms like for example Work Capability Assessments. “We can also now sign on a claimants behalf so they no longer have to come in to the centre to sign forms, which has been a big help. While this has given us a bit more breathing space we now anticipate there will be a spike in form filling come September and October. So there are definitely more pressures waiting down the line. Its hard to imagine how we will ever resume normal ways of working. I think this will all lead to a review of how we deliver advice services which will see it transformed in the long-term and I think we have a long way to go before we thingsto any kind of normality.

Welfare Advice Coordinator Donna Burke and the team of eight advisors based there have been inundated by calls from new claimants, but are buoyed up by the strength of the community resilience efforts in the area. I can see how it can be so frustrating for anyone trying to access benefits when there is so much uncertainty and change at the moment, weve had to adapt as best we can, she admits. The biggest concern is quite simply ensuring that people have enough money to live on. Its as basic as that. “With so many new claimants, they have to get registered which can be a complicated process in itself, but then we have to explain to them that they will have to wait until that support comes through which leaves people extremely anxious. “There can be no room for error. Thats upsetting for our advisors as well.

Its a cycling pandemic, joked Brian Cassidy of Claudy Cycles, who hasnt seen demand like this during his  years in business. First it was toilet roll and now its bicycles. I have had people queuing right out to the gate and people haveactually texted me thinking there was a wake going on because they saw all the cars parked on the road. Groups of cyclists have become a familiar sight across the city as people take advantage of their daily exercise allowance to get out and about on two wheels. googletag.cmd.push The country is going mad for bikes, said Mr Cassidy, who is working from am until pm at night delivering and repairing them. Everybody is on furlough and once they got their new fences built and painted they all wanted a bike. With manufacturing halted in China due to the globalpandemic, bike supplies have dried up and Mr Cassidy estimates it could be up to two weeks beforehe has them in stock again. Theres not a bike to be got at the minute, he said. I was selling bikes to people as far away as Sligo and people were buying them after only seeing a picture on WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push Mr Cassidy has also seen a huge upsurge in repairs as people across Derry pull their neglectedbikes out of attics and garden sheds. People are digging up these old relics to be fixed, he laughed. Ive been surprised with some of the things people are bringing to me and of course they all want them done today. Will Ennett from the Northland Road has been getting out and about on his new bike during lockdown, which has a specially built trailer for his two kids Rose, , and Johnny, . The children love the novelty of it and wehave been discovering lots of new places like Ebrington Square and the old railway line at the Foyle Road, he said. Its a new hobby and something I plan to keep up once lockdown is over. Halfords has also seen a surge in bike orders at itsCrescent Link store which is currently closedto the public, but is offering a click and collect service. If you were looking for a bike today you would struggle to find one that is in stock, said storemanager, Colm Shiels. We get three deliveries a week and they come in the back door and we build them and then they are going out the front door to customers. We have been flat out, its been like Christmas. So what is the appeal of cycling during lockdown  People love the freedom to get out and about, Mr Shiels explained. The gyms and swimming pools are closed so people who are used to daily exercise are having to think of dferent ways to do it. For some people cycling is a way to justy some bad habits they might have taken up duringlockdown. Businesshas also gone through the roof for Bee Cycles repair service. A spokesperson for Bees Cycles said they were strugglingto cope with demand. It feels like we are busy  , there had never been anything like it before. It has been hard to keep up with demand but its great to see. News of the massive increase in the sale of bikes in Derry comes just days after plans were announced to create a new Cycling Champion role in the city. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said earlier this month that she wants to appoint a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support our new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better. “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government.

Its a cycling pandemic, joked Brian Cassidy of Claudy Cycles, who hasnt seen demand like this during his  years in business. First it was toilet roll and now its bicycles. I have had people queuing right out to the gate and people haveactually texted me thinking there was a wake going on because they saw all the cars parked on the road. Groups of cyclists have become a familiar sight across the city as people take advantage of their daily exercise allowance to get out and about on two wheels. googletag.cmd.push The country is going mad for bikes, said Mr Cassidy, who is working from am until pm at night delivering and repairing them. Everybody is on furlough and once they got their new fences built and painted they all wanted a bike. With manufacturing halted in China due to the globalpandemic, bike supplies have dried up and Mr Cassidy estimates it could be up to two weeks beforehe has them in stock again. Theres not a bike to be got at the minute, he said. I was selling bikes to people as far away as Sligo and people were buying them after only seeing a picture on WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push Mr Cassidy has also seen a huge upsurge in repairs as people across Derry pull their neglectedbikes out of attics and garden sheds. People are digging up these old relics to be fixed, he laughed. Ive been surprised with some of the things people are bringing to me and of course they all want them done today. Will Ennett from the Northland Road has been getting out and about on his new bike during lockdown, which has a specially built trailer for his two kids Rose, , and Johnny, . The children love the novelty of it and wehave been discovering lots of new places like Ebrington Square and the old railway line at the Foyle Road, he said. Its a new hobby and something I plan to keep up once lockdown is over. Halfords has also seen a surge in bike orders at itsCrescent Link store which is currently closedto the public, but is offering a click and collect service. If you were looking for a bike today you would struggle to find one that is in stock, said storemanager, Colm Shiels. We get three deliveries a week and they come in the back door and we build them and then they are going out the front door to customers. We have been flat out, its been like Christmas. So what is the appeal of cycling during lockdown  People love the freedom to get out and about, Mr Shiels explained. The gyms and swimming pools are closed so people who are used to daily exercise are having to think of dferent ways to do it. For some people cycling is a way to justy some bad habits they might have taken up duringlockdown. Businesshas also gone through the roof for Bee Cycles repair service. A spokesperson for Bees Cycles said they were strugglingto cope with demand. It feels like we are busy  , there had never been anything like it before. It has been hard to keep up with demand but its great to see. News of the massive increase in the sale of bikes in Derry comes just days after plans were announced to create a new Cycling Champion role in the city. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said earlier this month that she wants to appoint a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support our new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better. “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

Thatrsquos all considered part of your exercise and itrsquos to be able to enjoy that.He said people were still not allowed to sunbathe but that being able to go out to the beach made up for the lack of other social access and activity.ldquoWe have a lot of friends here, particularly other people like ourselves who are all from the same area, and we are missing out being able to meet up with them in bars and restaurants, ldquo said Gareth.ldquoWe are very fortunate that we have been able to go out to the beach on an evening after work, so it doesnrsquot feel like we are so cooped up and we both really love the outdoors le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Tribute.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Bears’ chairman who loved sport  ","story":"TOLLYMORE United FC chairman John McIlvenny passed away peacefully at his home last week after a long battle against a very debilitating illness.John was involved in the Tollymore club since its formation in  and was chairman for  of its  years. He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

I would totally agree the use of cones on this hard shoulderis fundamental and has made a dference previously.”Alderman Jim Speers said it “is only a matter of time before tragedy happens on that road” and called for a “permanent solution” to be found for this issue.“I must say, as members will be aware, I have raised this point on many occasions,” said the Ulster Unionist Party’s Cusher Councillor.“I have seen the cars parked on the main road but yesterdaythere were  to  cars parked down at the chapel crossroads as well.“It is only a matter of time before some tragedy happens on that road.“I have seen kids getting out of cars and kids running around and I have seen it on many occasions. There needs to be some permanent solution to this issue.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
