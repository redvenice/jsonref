After travelling through Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and Italy, he reached Holland where his asylum claim was rejected, and in April last year, The Dutch authorities gave him a ticket to go back to Romania.Terrified he might be forcibly deported, he took a train to Calais. He knew other Iranians were living near the port in charity tents, planning to take boats illegally across the Channel to England.It was there, last autumn, he met Hadi, a former Tehran taxi-driver who had also fallen foul of the strictly religious Iranian regime for having a relationship with a married woman.The scandal blew up (the woman\u0027s husband had found out about the affair and reported him to the regime) just days after flying into Paris for a tour of Europe. His family immediately \u0027disowned\u0027 him for this \u0027cardinal sin\u0027 and, by now on the authorities\u0027 \u0027black list\u0027, he applied for asylum in Germany.But his claim was rejected and he, too, ended up at the Calais shanty camp, from where he claimed asylum in France.Hadi tells me that conditions in the camp were horrific. He claims four Sudanese people-traffickers attacked an Algerian friend in the neck and chest with carpet cutters. The man nearly died, but recovered in hospital.It was at this point that he and Masoud plotted their escape.A few days later, on August 8, they walked to the Decathlon sports store in Calais. They had a little over €400 (£360) between them, saved by Hadi from an allowance given each week to him as an asylum-seeker by the French government.         Graphic shows the men\u0027s journeys. Both are claiming asylum and hope to stay in BritainExplains Masoud: \u0027We had to choose the cheapest two-seat polyester kayak and bendy plastic paddles. We bought the most basic pump to blow up the kayak.\u0027The boat cost €250 (£220) and we only had money left for one life-jacket, for Hadi who does not swim. The label said it was for a young teenager.\u0027It took them more than an hour to carry the equipment to the beach and they hid in the dunes, waiting to prepare their crossing.Masoud says they checked the Channel weather, including wind speed, on the internet before setting out. It showed a low wind and no storm brewing. They did not check the tides.Masoud explained that French police use drones to hunt down would-be migrants, adding that there were officers hiding in the sand dunes with torches.When they felt safe, they quickly pumped up the kayak — which had a warning label saying it was suitable only for the beach and inland waters.They jettisoned their shoes to reduce the weight but even then the craft was eight stone over the recommended safety limit. Undeterred by the dangers ahead, they discarded their mobile phones to avoid GPS tracking by the French and British authorities.As the police continued to patrol nearby, the two Iranians threw stones several yards along the sand dunes as a ersionary tactic to make officers believe migrants were hiding there.This allowed them to sprint 700 metres into the sea without being seen. However, non-swimmer Hadi fell in and swallowed water.Masoud recalled: \u0027I had to save his life, pulling him into the kayak. I had to teach him how to paddle, too. It\u0027s a good thing he was a quick learner.\u0027They had only the compass on Masoud\u0027s Casio G-shock watch, a present from his sister, to guide them. \u0027We also followed the lights of the big ferries sailing from Calais to England.\u0027He says they had to paddle fast for at least half an hour to get out of inshore waters away from French police patrols looking for migrant boats.\u0027At one point, we got six metres from a ferry, which turned off its engines to stop us being sucked in by the propellers.\u0027This is thought to be common practice by ferry captains who see a constant stream of migrant boats leaving Calais and cannot halt their journey to rescue every one.Astonishingly, he claims they were spotted by a French police launch which then backed off once it saw the danger of the ferry propellers to its own boat. Masoud and Hadi believe this is why it suddenly returned to shore.After this scare, all went well and the Channel was calm.But then, Hadi, a former amateur boxer, began vomiting the sea-water that he\u0027d swallowed on the beach.\u0027I was paddling alone,\u0027 says Masoud. \u0027Hadi was almost unconscious. I pulled his head back on my knees, distributing his weight evenly. He was breathing shallowly. For two hours he was silent.\u0027Then a huge storm started.Amid 7ft high waves, the 11-ft kayak was tossed like a piece of flotsam.Masoud struggled to stop it overturning. \u0027If a wave had hit us sideways, we would have left this life.\u0027On they went, relentlessly, through the night.Hadi recovered to share the paddling. The kayak was fast shipping water, which they scooped out with their bare hands. By now, it was 5.30am and nearing daylight, six long hours after leaving the French beach, the storm subsided.They paddled on for two more hours and then finally spotted Dover\u0027s town lights.Masoud said: \u0027We had five miles to go and I was sure we were going to make it. We were excited. Then we heard a helicopter from the British Coastguard. It was the most beautiful noise. It hovered over us for an hour, watching us paddling, then went away, before coming back.\u0027Within minutes, a British Border Force cutter, alerted by the helicopter crew, was at their side.After their epic journey, they were safe.The Mail cannot verify every detail of what the men have told about their life in Iran, the reasons they entered Europe or for fleeing Calais to Britain.However, in Masoud\u0027s case we have photos of him competing for Iran in kayaking and other water-sporting competitions, and a dated photo of him in the controversial USA T-shirt with his team-mates in Indonesia.As for Hadi, we have seen Home Office letters to him which confirm that he arrived in Europe on a holiday visa allowing him to travel throughout the EU, and last year claimed asylum in Germany and France.I first heard of the two kayakers from an Iranian living in Germany whom I have known for nearly two years. He mentioned that two friends had recently paddled on a kayak to the UK from France and offered to put me in touch with them.I checked with Border Force reports which confirmed that two Iranian kayakers had, indeed, been found in the sea near Dover the previous Friday. They were among at least 40 migrants who had sailed to Britain overnight, the others in small boats unconnected to the kayakers.Tragically, an Iranian woman fell from a boat and was drowned.Such are the huge risks that migrants are taking to cross on tiny boats to Britain that the MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke this week warned: \u0027It\u0027s rapidly heading to a summer of chaos.\u0027On Thursday, more than 60 migrants were rescued on small boats off the coast of Kent and Sussex after they had sailed from the French coast.Sussex Police said it was \u0027very concerned\u0027 for another group, which it described as \u0027possibly a family including children\u0027, who may have escaped from the beach to avoid the British authorities.More than 1,000 boat migrants have reached Britain from France since last October.Yesterday by midday, another eleven had arrived at Dover on a small boat.All this makes a mockery of the Government\u0027s pledge to halt the flow of illegal boat arrivals.No wonder Home Secretary Priti Patel is to hold urgent talks with her French counterpart and her officials have said the criminal people-trafficking gangs who perpetuate this \u0027are ruthless and do not care about loss of life\u0027.Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned illegal boat migrants that they face being returned.So as the two Iranian kayakers now recover at their hostel, what are their plans?Both are claiming asylum and hope to stay in Britain.Masoud nonetheless dreams of eventually being able to return to \u0027beautiful\u0027 Iran and his career in water-sports.For his part, Hadi wants to make his life in the UK and \u0027contribute to society\u0027.Whether they get their wishes is now up to the Home Office.But whatever the men\u0027s future, their remarkable tale leaves no doubt about the astonishing lengths that migrants continue to go in order to come to Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"South African safari guide stops giant wild elephant tracks click fingers","story":"Share this article          Almost instantly, the driver clicks his fingers a few times and flicks his hand in a way to shoo the elephant (pictured)\u0027The children were being very playful with the car and were trying to be mischievous when a larger elephant came out and looked to charge onward at the car.\u0027The guide told us there had been a similar incident with the same elephant a few weeks prior.\u0027Luckily, the elephant was obedient this time and listened to the commands of the veteran safari guide and moved away from the front of the car.\u0027         Amazingly, the elephant stops dead in its tracks before turning and walking to the other side of the road (pictured)In emergency cases tour guides have been known to use similar techniques to deter elephants.The beasts can weigh up to 6000kg and stand up to 11ft tall.They have destroyed cars and safari vehicles when angered and kill up to 500 people a year worldwide.Elephant attacks mostly occur when the young males are in musth, where their testosterone levels are highly increased and they can become very aggressive.In South Africa, however, there is more threat to the elephant - as up to 55 elephants are killed every day by poachers."},{"url":null,"title":"NASA investigates claims astronaut accessed spouses bank account space","story":"Share this article McClain claimed that she was using the same password that she had always used during their relationship and that she had not been told to stop accessing Worden\u0027s bank account. McClain and Worden married in 2014, with Worden filing for orce in 2018 after McClain accused her of assault, a claim which Worden denies and said was part of McClain\u0027s efforts at gaining custody of her son.

We all have them from time to time. When I’m experiencing a reading rut, what I most want is a great story, beautifully told, and to be reminded of the transformative power of language. For this, I always turn to The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox by Maggie O’Farrell, My Name Is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout or Life After Life by Kate Atkinson.Another good tactic is to immerse yourself in epic, multi-generational tales: try Jane Smiley’s Last Hundred Years Trilogy, which follows the trials and tribulations of five generations of a family from 1920s Iowa to present-day New York. Or for single-volume stories of epic lives, take a look at William Boyd’s Any Human Heart or John Boyne’s The Heart’s Invisible Furies: both modern classics.If you’re looking for similarly exquisite storytelling but in bite-size chunks, try The Collected Stories of Grace Paley: quietly devastating tales of postwar American life.For many people, a love of reading was ignited in childhood, so returning to childhood favourites can be an excellent route out of reading ruts. In her recent book, Why You Should Read Children’s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise (itself a great read), Katherine Rundell convincingly argues that children’s books can speak to us throughout our lives. There are few reading slumps that won’t be cured by Roald Dahl’s Matilda, AA Milne’s Winnie the Pooh, Noel Streatfeild’s Ballet Shoes or Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy.Finally, since reading provokes empathy, narrative nonfiction and memoir can help nourish the soul. Adam Kay’s This Is Going to Hurt is both hilarious and moving and will remind you that books, at their best, can run the gamut of emotion from one page to the next. Meanwhile, the case studies of psychotherapist Irvin D Yalom, in books such as Love’s Executioner, Momma and the Meaning of Life or Creatures of a Day, will, I guarantee, make you fall back in love not only with reading but with humanity too.If Only I Could Tell You by Hannah Beckerman is out now in paperback (Orion, £7.99).Submit your question to book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3babb4d6659b79c74d5408cd63ff5e3756ec4bd0/0_397_5952_3571/master/5952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e118ec649bb277de57a0ad7d39a8e8e9","title":"etgar keret interview fly already","story":"Etgar Keret is one of Israel’s leading writers, known best for his short stories, graphic novels and screenplays in 2016, he also published an acclaimed memoir, The Seven Good Years. His new collection, Fly Already, features a father who turns into a rabbit and an array of other surreal and apocalyptic scenarios. He lives in Tel Aviv with his wife and son.Like your other books, Fly Already is a wild ride. Can you tell me a bit about what you’re trying to do with short fiction?For the past 33 years, I’ve been writing short stories, I would say, almost constantly. It’s really more like an uncontrollable reflex, you know, than a career decision. It’s my way of coping with reality.My stories come from a very unconscious place. I don’t premeditate them, I don’t know what’s going to happen in them. Something about this transformation from writing short stories into a collection is almost like a therapy process in which I understand where I am at that time, what is bothering me, what is my experience.It wasn’t Technicolor enough!I always saw it in American movies and it always had greater production value, a nicer musical score… I felt this overwhelming experience, like a candle that we know will go out in a second and everything will go dark and at the same time this kind of understanding that on a global scale, you know, nothing happened. Those cars will keep driving by and the McDonald’s will switch from breakfast to lunch at 11:30, and this idea of the title that came up to my mind was the Hebrew title of the collection, which is A Glitch at the Edge of the Galaxy.Many of the stories take place in a recognisable present day, but others are highly speculative and create a parallel reality. Why is that?I think the stories that I write about, say, cloning, or about AI, when I read them, I feel for sure that it’s a fable‑like way to talk about racism and about xenophobia, and about the human instinct to try to find entities that have less rights than you and exploit them. You know, maybe in some ways, it’s easier to write a story about a clone than to write a story about a refugee arriving in a European country.Politics run through your work. What do you feel about what’s happening?The kind of crap that Johnson and Trump are doing now in the US and UK, Netanyahu’s been doing for the past 20 years I think he understood a long time ago that you don’t have to control the country, you have to control the discourse. If in the past the role of the leader was of this kind of selfless person who puts the country in front of him, now it’s the kind of guy that could win a Big Brother reality show. Everybody knows his name, a total asshole, but never boring this is what you really demand from this guy, to be kind of visible and to be above the noise.Back to the stories, I notice a lot of strange, shape-shifting animals…Well, as I speak to you, my rabbit also listens.You really have a rabbit?Yes, I’ll send you a photo of him! He’s really into storytelling. It’s funny because when I sit next to my computer and I write emails or surf, he never comes, but the moment I start writing a story he comes and sits next to my feet and doesn’t get up until I finish it.What’s the last really great book that you read?I’m usually honest in my writing and less honest in interviews, but I can tell you that for the past year, I didn’t read any book, which is the first time since I went to first grade.Why was that?My wife and I were working on a very demanding TV series, a project that demanded relocation and that we direct in French, when we don’t speak French, so all in all it was a very overwhelming experience. It took a lot of my inner space.This year, I’ve been doing something that – if we talk about changes in humanity – all humanity’s been doing, but I guess I gave myself a very good alibi. Whenever I wanted to delve into a book, I would go and watch a Netflix series instead I must say for pure laziness, because I think the big difference between a TV or film and reading a book is that reading a book demands creativity from you, because you need to imagine things and you need to create them in your mind. And I felt so drained at the end of the day that I wanted somebody else to think out how the characters look.As a child, were you a keen reader?From the moment I started writing, I read less. I think reading was a way of widening the world in which I lived, and that the moment I started writing I found a different way to widen it. So I would alternate between writing such a reality or reading such a reality.I grew up in a family where this traditional transformation between being a child and being an adult was much more blurred. My parents were both children of war, with my mum being orphaned from both her parents at a young age and growing up in a hostile environment when she was in the orphanage, grownups were the people who were trying to steal food, not the people who took her aside and protected her. Then the idea was that reality was what you wanted it to be.Was there one specific writer you loved?When I was my son’s age, 13, Douglas Adams’s books revolutionised the way that I thought. Not as an artist, because I was not an artist, but as a human being. When I was young, being exposed to Douglas Adams’s books, or to Monty Python, or Blackadder, it’s not that they affected my taste but they affected my attitude to the interaction of this thing called life.• Fly Already by Etgar Keret is published by Granta (£12.99).

It betrays its troubled origins – the unpicked remnants of an autobiographical novel – in the thinness of the material, which is all the more scandalous when you think how rich and full Amis’s other long novels are. This fiction about feminism via a 1970s Italian holiday is cheerfully vulgar but – the worst horror of all for comic writing – fundamentally boring.Typical line “How was it that he had never taken due note of this –the beauty, power, wisdom and justice of women’s thighs?”Amis tropes Authorial intrusion, height, men called Keith, sex, timeAmis’s second novel sought to shock with its drugs, violence and (mostly “cancelled”) sex among a group of repellent hedonists who reject humane values as “dead babies”. Inside there’s an attempt at murder mystery and a Menippean satire on society’s progress and the limits of liberation, but it’s drowned out by a chaotic structure and the stink of the male characters’ misogyny.Typical line “Keith Whitehead lay on sandpaper blankets farting like a wizard.”Amis tropes Height, Keith, sex, teethThe best to be said about this book is that Amis clearly had fun writing it. But his style now is harder than it used to be, with less give, and this blunt comedy about a lottery-winning yob, vindaloo-eating dogs (“you never give them the Tabasco!”), 25-year-old grannies and a cast from a Channel 5 shockumentary feels sour, especially as written by a man in a Brooklyn brownstone and subtitled (yes!) State of England.Typical line “Cilla and Lionel were known in the family as ‘the twins’, because they were the only children who had the same father.”Amis tropes Porn, Special Brew, yobsWe are now as far from Amis’s debut as it was from Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, so it shouldn’t surprise that the attitudes creak, but the grotesque descriptions of women are hard to take. Amis said anyone would have published his debut purely through curiosity, which is true. (Recall the New Statesman competition for the unlikeliest book title: winner, Martin Amis – My Struggle.) This story of a young man’s seduction plans has a handful of funny set pieces but is crude and immature.Typical line “Having Kleenex on the bedside chair was tantamount to a poster reading ‘The big thing about me is that I wank a devil of a lot.’”Amis tropes Sex, teethWhat a mess! Nobody reads Amis for his plots – it’s the page-pleasure and the pungent atmospheres we want – and this one has chaos baked into its febrile structure. But for all its weaknesses (Xan Meo’s resurgent male violence, the baffling coffin-on-a-plane strand) there are full-blooded, funny Amis grotesques in tabloid journalist Clint Smoker and King Henry IX. The softening of vision (or sentimentality), in his writing about children is notable too.Typical line “His orce had been so vicious that even the lawyers had panicked.”Amis tropes Apocalypse, sex, yobsAmis’s third novel brought much needed structure to his antic early style. It’s told in neatly paired narratives by adoptive brothers Gregory and Terry Riding, whose respective fortunes vary wildly. It also shows a new interest in characterisation, though oddly for a self-professed “gynocrat” (“the world would be better if women ruled it”), this was Amis’s third book in a row where women are little more than sexual objects.Typical line “I want to shout with pain and pull the world apart, but I just vaguely peek in the direction of the girl’s breasts.”Amis tropes Height, sex, teeth, twinsAmis’s best novels this century have been those that don’t offer diminishing returns on his 80s and 90s comic peak. You can feel under the page the effort he put into this novel, a love triangle in a Soviet gulag. Outside the loose plot, it’s mostly research left over from his Stalin book Koba the Dread, but the highly controlled narrative voice, with just echoes of the usual Amis repetitions and neologisms, makes it work.Typical line “Something strange was happening in the Soviet Union, after the war against fascism: fascism.”Amis tropes History, sex, time, twinsIf Success was Amis’s first interesting novel, his next book Other People (subtitled A Mystery Story: geddit?) was his first good one. It even has a female protagonist, albeit one who looks in the mirror in order to admire her breasts. Mary Lamb’s amnesia enables Amis to employ defamiliarising descriptions borrowed from Craig Raine’s Martian poetry, and a conceit from William Golding’s Pincher Martin.Typical line “Limp hardly did justice to the spectacular unevenness of Mrs Botham’s gait: she walked like a clockwork hurdler.”Amis tropes Authorial intrusion, sexThe technique for Amis’s best novel of the 21st century – and his second about Auschwitz – is similar to that of House of Meetings: it’s research-driven, but the strong narrative voices (two Nazis and one Jew) put character in the foreground. What happens when the unstoppable force of Amis’s style meets the immovable object of the Holocaust? More than you might expect.Typical line “Who are you? You don’t know. Then you come to the Zone of Interest, and it tells you who you are.”Amis tropes History, sexAmis’s most London novel (“the streets like a terrible carpet”) is also his longest and most ambitious. It’s relentlessly quotable and memorable, but multiple focal points (sexy “murderee” Nicola Six, darts-playing lowlife Keith Talent, third wheel Guy Clinch and tricky narrator Samson Young) and a complicated structure give the narrative a clotted, staccato feel. And even by Amis’s standards, its misanthropy is off the scale.Typical line “Keith didn’t look like a murderer. He looked like a murderer’s dog.”Amis tropes Apocalypse, authorial intrusion, Keith, sex, time, twins, yobs (jackpot!)Amis once accepted that his metier is “banalities delivered with tremendous force”. That summarises this book’s high concept: the Holocaust could make sense only in an inverted world, so let’s tell the life story of a Nazi doctor backwards. The execution is perfectly achieved: at first somewhat comic, then devastating. It won Amis his only Booker shortlisting and deserved it.Typical line “When is the world going to start making sense? Yet the answer is out there. It is rushing toward me over the uneven ground.”Amis tropes History, timeHis shortest novel has Amis’s only female narrator, and is written as a police mystery about a young woman’s suicide. But it cuts deep, with an understated (for Amis) style and his most humane protagonist: he finally wrote, after all these years, a good person. This book is one of his greatest achievements. Don’t believe me? Seek out Janis Freedman Bellow’s essay Second Thoughts on Night Train.Typical line “Here’s what happened. A woman fell out of a clear blue sky.”Amis tropes Addiction, twinsAnother big book about London (“the streets looked like the insides of an old plug”), centred on a struggling writer whose only friend has become the thing he fears most: a bestselling novelist. The comedy is unsparing but affectionate and the existential angst more acute than ever, even if the connected plot featuring minor criminals (Amis’s usual obsession) is less successful.Typical line: “The information is telling me – the information is telling me to stop saying hi and to start saying bye.”Amis tropes Apocalypse, authorial intrusion, height, tennis, time, yobsMoney was a leap ahead of Amis’s previous books, an expansion of talent nudging genius, a helplessly funny voice, a 400-page monologue about addiction, failure, despair and lack of self-awareness. So appalling is his narrator John Self (I had to keep faith with my namesake) that Amis appears as a character in the book to show distance. Money shows that style is not something tacked on to a story: the style is the story.Typical line “Look at my life. I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking: It’s terrific! It’s great! You’re thinking: Some guys have all the luck!”Amis tropes Addiction, authorial intrusion, sex, teeth, tennis, twins"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4b3e2dae9509a92b21f05c5152270bb776c10b/0_340_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a158dd6fce08942495a1a27f2d1b42","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

We are getting in touch with all those customers this afternoon to clarify that their flight will go ahead as planned. We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused.”He said anyone who went on to spend money on alternative arrangements should contact British Airways “and we will deal with each case on an inidual basis”.The spokesman clarified that some flights on non-strike days will be affected, but that the bulk of those cancelled are on the three strike days.Numerous passengers on flights that will be grounded tried in vain to contact the airline to make alternative arrangements on Saturday. One told the PA news agency his 10-year wedding anniversary “trip of a lifetime” was in doubt after more than 100 calls to BA to get a refund went unanswered.The airline’s customer service lines were jammed on Saturday morning after passengers booked on flights received emails overnight warning “a large number of delays and cancellations” were likely during the action.Scott Kishere, a filmmaker and police community officer, told PA: “My wife and I have been told that our flight to Toronto has been cancelled. This was a full package we booked through BA for our 10-year wedding anniversary. I have made over 100 attempts to contact them for a refund and they’re not answering.“Until we get a refund we do not have the money to rebook our trip of a lifetime. With the days counting down it now looks unlikely we will be able to celebrate our 10-year anniversary as expected.”Mr Kishere, from Dorset, is one of hundreds of passengers who have tried desperately to contact BA on social media and its phone lines. He said he also plans to travel to Chicago for the city’s marathon with his partner one week after the final day of strikes, but fears that could also be impacted.“We have worked so hard for these trips and BA do not have the decency or customer care to support us. For them this has been on the cards for a long time and I cannot believe they didn’t have a contingency in place.”Others have also tweeted at BA telling them their wedding plans have been threatened by the action.﻿BA has said its proposed pay deal has been accepted by members of the Unite and GMB unions, which represent engineers, cabin crew and ground staff.Balpa said more strike dates could yet be announced, adding they are “a last resort and with enormous frustration at the way the business is now being run”.﻿The airline said it will offer refunds and rebookings, adding: “We will do everything we can to get as many people away on their journeys as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab28a105e7e5ba0aa0d9cd9bdb6c2494bc9bc137/0_276_2383_1430/master/2383.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c35f40e2f3ca110a077e4744c1f9f36","title":"prince andrew appalled epstein royal wedding","story":"Perhaps a royal wedding for Princess Beatrice might offer a welcome distraction for a man-of-the-world under unfair scrutinyWaa waa waa. What could be a more effective heartstring-tugger than “other European princes have it better than me”? It’s right up there with Chandler’s line from Friends: “My wallet’s too small for my 50s, and my diamond shoes are too tight!”The scene is recalled in an email revealed by Brockman’s soon-to-be former client, the tech author Evgeny Morozov. He is one of many esting themselves of even tenuous Epstein association in the wake of the billionaire financier’s suicide in a Manhattan jail earlier this month, as he awaited trial for sex trafficking, underage and otherwise.But what of Andy? Under some scrutiny, he and ex-wife Duchess Fergie private-jetted away from Balmoral last week, then on to the luxury bit of Sotogrande, where they are said to be gracing private barbecues. Briefings suggest, distractingly, that they might be getting back together. Andrew has been snapped on an exclusive golf course. His daughter Princess Beatrice might be getting engaged to her boyfriend. “They’re going to get married,” royal expert Ingrid Seward declared this week, ertingly. “I was told by a member of the family.” So, on go the Yorks. It really is the full fairytale. By which I mean: fairly Grimm.Back to the foot massage scene, then, where the chaps seem to have got on to Prince Albert’s night-time freedom via the subject of Julian Assange. Brockman reports Andy saying: “We think they’re liberal in Sweden, but it’s more like northern England as opposed to southern Europe.” Is the implication that Swedish authorities investigating sexual assault allegations are being illiberal?Either way, you don’t get all that nanny state stuff on Epstein’s private Virgin Islands property, reportedly known locally as “Paedophile Island”. Or as Buckingham Palace finally put it in a statement denying any impropriety on behalf of the prince: “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes.”I’m slightly sorry for the royal flunkies who had to issue this line, given that most of us are suffering eyeball strain from all the rolling we’re doing. Even so, I do feel we need further clarification on what precisely the Duke is appalled by. Is it just the “recent reports”? Because if we’re meant to believe that Prince Andrew is appalled by ALL of the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein – both the ones alleged and the ones he served actual jail time for – then allow me to treat this statement with all the dignity it deserves. To wit: BULL. SHIT. Bullshit Prince Andrew didn’t know what sort of guy his friend was when he was snapped walking with the Tier 1 sex offender, after he got out of jail, in a photo the New York Post headlined “PRINCE \u0026amp PERV”. Bullshit he didn’t know why his close friend WENT TO PRISON FOR A YEAR, but kept hanging out with him anyway. Bullshit if, as Brockman recounts, he lay on his back in that guy’s house, with a Russian attending to his feet, talking over her head to men of the world about the nocturnal licence afforded to minor European royals, and he didn’t know roughly what he was swimming in. Bullshit. I get we have to pay for Andrew’s lifetime of jollies but we don’t have to have our intelligence insulted by him.I’m not even going to wheel out that old writing device where one says that either Prince Andrew is stupid or deeply compromised, and wonder archly which it is. Guys, he can be both! In fact, the one feeds the other.The plain fact is that Andrew continued to be friends with Epstein even after he pleaded guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution. I guess it was the old she-said, he-said thing. Or as the then-Palm Beach police chief put it: “This was 50-something ‘shes’ and one ‘he’ – and the shes all basically told the same story.” Obviously, Epstein got away lightly with his grotesque plea deal, because 50-something:1 isn’t the ratio you need. Even last year, they still needed 60 accusers to stop Bill Cosby. Donald Trump’s 17:1 she-he ratio is nowhere near enough to keep him from the highest office on the planet.As for where we go from here, perhaps a multimillion-pound royal wedding would indeed be helpful. It should be quite the opposite. Where Princess Anne pointedly didn’t, Prince Andrew demanded all the titles and trappings for his two daughters – security details, civil list money, full royal weddings – and was furious when denied some of them. Yet Beatrice and Eugenie still live like … well, princesses.So instead of distracting from the miserable stories of the female attendees of various Epstein mansions, these gilded lives should throw them into even more shameful relief. They suggest the kind of man – and we’ve all met them – who has a two-tier view of the female sex. There is a world for their daughters, hopefully insulated from men like their friend Jeffrey, and then there is another world for the girls who service their friend Jeffrey.Yet decent, humane people know there aren’t two kinds of women and girls – there are just women and girls. I’m reminded of the climactic line in All My Sons, where the wartime profiteer Joe Keller has been finally made – by his own son’s suicide note – to see how his actions were responsible for the fate of so many other young men. “I think to him they were all my sons,” Keller reflects. “And I guess they were. I guess they were.”And so with the girls in the stories that swirl around Epstein and his circle, which includes the Duke: either broken, or yet-to-be-broken. But ultimately, breakable. They are all daughters, too, your Royal Highness. The Russian masseuse on your feet, the 17-year-old runaway on whose bare hip you have your hand in that fateful picture in London, the terrified 14-year-old who ran screaming from your great friend’s house in her underwear, who you must have read about at the time, because I did, and I didn’t even know the guy. And all the others. They are each someone’s daughter, or they were once. They all once played at princesses and castles and imagined their own fairytale weddings. Funny how dreams die, isn’t it – and who helps to crush them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cab89e843a44df8400e5f95b2e3c5915fb3a6d4/0_281_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43d9da9674b763d9e79592285c70be43","title":"age shall not weary her wisdom or her sharp tongue","story":"Soulful laments for the passing of a golden age of broadcasting freedom, for a time when news editors and documentary-makers were kings, are fairly standard at the Edinburgh television festival. Back then, the newsrooms were full of smoke and dynamism. Decisions were made on the hoof, with no recourse to compliance rules nor balance guidelines.So Dorothy Byrne’s startling MacTaggart lecture last week was a true tonic. This accomplished messenger from the past, a woman who, unusually, still has a top job in television, reminded us it was really not such fun in those frontier days. Yet she was very funny about it.Self-styled as the first “wee old lady” at the MacTaggart lectern, Byrne, who is actually only 66 and runs Channel 4’s news and current affairs programming, bewitched her audience with memories of the male-dominated agendas that once held sway and of working atmospheres she has previously likened to a men’s lavatory.While Byrne made other key points about today’s climate of political ision and about handling the distrust of “mass media”, her best zingers were rooted in TV history and came out with all the pent-up force of an oil gusher. After all, Byrne, who started her 40-year career at Granada in Manchester, has had to watch a succession of men delivering the annual MacTaggart lecture, with a few exceptions. Most of these men were illustrious enough, but others not so much, and one, according to Byrne, was downright sordid, although he remains as yet unnamed. Even her audience came under fire: “Tonight, there’ll be no shortage of sexist bastards, possibly among you in the audience.”The real power behind Byrne’s amusing and score-settling speech was its account of how hard it has always been to tell important stories. At Granada, an early suggestion that World in Action tackle the issue of marital rape was initially dismissed as the stuff of morning TV chitchat, recalled this wannabe “methuselah” of telly.Byrne would have to concede that the Irish writer Edna O’Brien, at the grand age of 88, is much closer than her to methuselah status. But O’Brien also knows how it feels to have stories suppressed. Celebrated in New Review, O’Brien is publishing a 19th novel, Girl. It is set in Nigeria and tackles a story of the abuse and terrorising of young women that Channel 4 has also chronicled.But in 1960, O’Brien’s beloved coming-of-age novel, her gentle and sensitive tale The Country Girls was banned in Ireland, as was Girl With Green Eyes in 1962, and two years later again, Girls in Their Married Bliss. These fictional stories of sexual yearning, misadventure and female defiance were regarded as beyond the pale in Catholic Ireland. What is more, in O’Brien’s tiny hometown in County Clare, her mother was warned that if her errant daughter ever returned she would be “kicked naked around the town”.This weekend, O’Brien said she is not yet “throwing in the towel” and still regards herself as capable of real anger, “but I am not old and bitter”.Her Scottish junior, Dorothy Byrne, another indomitable phenomenon, although a whippersnapper in comparison, is also promising more. In Edinburgh, she urged her fellow news and documentary programme-makers, both men and the women, to stand up together to tell braver stories.Although, Byrne wryly admitted, it is harder to find women among her senior peers: “What happened to them? Were they all murdered?”History, we often hear, gets to be told by the victors. Surely by now these two arch-survivors can be counted as winners? If so, perhaps the rest of us have less to fear.• Vanessa Thorpe is the Observer’s arts and media correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d0986704de256da31e51ef04b8aaad2bca76011/84_93_1884_1131/master/1884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de39b8aa25edc778175a106e28870f27","title":"douglas adams was right knowledge without understanding is meaningless","story":"Using supercomputers to explain life, the universe and everything takes us into territory previously only laughed atFans of Douglas Adams’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy treasure the bit where a group of hyper-dimensional beings demand that a supercomputer tells them the secret to life, the universe and everything.

They are, says one expert, “the most spectacular machines ever created for moving atoms at the nanoscale and often do chemistry orders of magnitude more efficiently than anything that we’ve built”.But these vital biomachines are also inscrutable because they assemble themselves into structures of astonishing complexity and beauty. (Illustrations of them make one think of what can go wrong when trying to wrap Christmas presents with those nice ribbons that only shop assistants can manage.) Understanding this “folding” process is one of the key challenges in biochemistry, partly because proteins are necessary for virtually every cell in a body and partly because it’s suspected that mis-folding may help to explain diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.So the question “How do proteins fold?” is definitely worth asking. The traditional way of answering it was by lab-based x-ray crystallography, which is expensive and slow. So researchers have turned to building computer models that simulate the folding process and predict protein structures. For some years, specialists in the field have run a biennial competition in critical assessment of protein structure prediction (CASP), where teams are challenged to design computer programs that predict protein structures from amino sequences.Two years ago, DeepMind, having conquered the board game Go, decided to take on the challenge, using the deep-learning technology it had developed for Go. The resulting machine was, predictably, named AlphaFold. At the CASP meeting last December, it unveiled the results. Its machine was, on average, more accurate than the other teams and by some criteria it was significantly ahead of the others. For protein sequences modelled from scratch – 43 of the 90 – AlphaFold made the most accurate prediction for 25 proteins. Its nearest rival only managed three.On the other hand, AlQuraishi also discussed the existential angst generated by AlphaFold in the young scientists present at the event. Their underlying concern, he says, was “whether protein structure prediction as an academic field has a future, or whether… the best research will from here on out get done in industrial labs, with mere breadcrumbs left for academic groups”. Young biochemists will have to decide whether it’s good for their careers to continue working on structure prediction. For some (many?) of them, it may make sense to go into industrial labs, while for others it will mean staying in academia but shifting to entirely new problems that avoid head-on competition with DeepMind.Underpinning all this, though, is a deeper question. Reaching a scientific explanation of how protein folding works will be a gigantic intellectual task. (In 1969, the molecular biologist Cyrus Levinthal formulated a famous paradox: as any protein can fold in an astronomically large number of ways it would take longer than the universe has existed for every configuration to be tested, yet most small proteins fold spontaneously in milliseconds. Nobody knows how.)It’s conceivable that a machine-learning approach will soon enable us to make accurate predictions of how a protein will fold and this may be very useful to know. But it won’t be scientific knowledge. After all, AlphaFold knows nothing about biochemistry. We’re heading into uncharted territory.Sale of the century Machine learning used to be an exotic technology. Now Timothy B Lee argues in Vox that it’s being commoditised. That may not be as good as it sounds.What’s your poison? If some algorithms can have harmful psychological effects on users, shouldn’t they be regulated like pharmacological drugs? There’s an interesting argument about it in Wired’s opinion section.Progressive learning Should “progress” be an academic subject?

Ten years after The L Word’s run ended, I expected to be cynical about its 2019 incarnation. Right now, in the world of entertainment, there are more planned comebacks than Fleetwood Mac have managed in their entire career. With mooted revivals of everything from The Matrix to Home Alone to Beverly Hills, 90210, you could read an issue of Empire magazine from the 1990s and assume it had come out last week.Generation Q (I’m trying to get on board, but it still sounds breathlessly perky, like a kids’ cartoon or a supermarket clothing line) is all about the young people, as the title suggests, and appears to be far less glossy and polished than its elite older sibling. Of the three original characters returning to LA’s lesbian scene, every fan will have their favourite. Shane is back, as is her haircut, and Alice, too, but Jennifer Beals’s Bette promises to make the biggest splash.Beals is an executive producer, but vitally will also reprise her role as alpha female Bette Porter, California’s answer to Swiss art curator and critic Hans Ulrich Obrist, who couldn’t resist booting the impressionists out of her gallery in favour of something modern, shocking and blasphemous, particularly if that enabled a flashback to a sexy, art-based hook-up from the past. In the new world, Bette is going straight to the top and is running to be mayor of Los Angeles.The original L Word was campy and crass, as over the top as it was revolutionary. But I loved it for everything it was. It gave viewers six seasons that put mostly queer women front and centre. For the first time, those characters were not the subplot, but the main event. Even so, at first I wondered if Generation Q was necessary. Times have changed beyond comprehension in a decade some of the storylines that seemed less worthy of remark then, such as Alice’s out-of-character transphobia, or Lisa the Lesbian Man, would incite an opinion mob in an instant.The growth of streaming television has opened up a world of queer storylines on all sorts of shows. If there isn’t a same-sex kiss on a Netflix series you start to wonder if you’ve accidentally skipped an episode. And then the Generation Q trailer brought it all back, gave me butterflies and of course, as if it was ever in doubt, I will be glued to the whole thing.In his new book Perfect Sound Whatever, comedian James Acaster makes a claim that may horrify the paternal gatekeepers of music history as much as it will delight dissenters: he argues that 2016 was the greatest ever year for music. Take that, dad rock. One-nil, 1970s. Following a breakdown, he set himself the task of listening only to music from 2016 (“the year before everything went wrong”) and bought more than 500 albums, including Beyoncé’s Lemonade and David Bowie’s Blackstar. (For younger readers, buying music is a bit like cassettes, which were a bit like smartphones, which were a bit like the chips soon to be implanted in our eyeballs.)The 2016 argument, which is about far more than just Acaster’s record collection, is deliberately provocative. “I’m trying to convince people to find their own greatest year for music,” he told the BBC. In a flash poll of my own opinions, I suspect I land somewhere between 1993 and 1994, because of Debut, Live Through This, Rid of Me and In Utero damaging my hearing at a critical point during my adolescence. Really, though, my choice can only ever be vaguely nostalgic nonsense. It’s fixed there because it’s easiest to pin down you’d be a fool to argue that music peaked in the early 1990s. In choosing 2016, Acaster makes a crucial point: that innovation still happens and at a pace.Already, 2019 has been a fantastic year. Every week, there’s a new album to get excited about, something odd and explosive and different and new. To recognise that is a welcome relief from the endless chokehold of prizing the past, the idea that older is always better, that something recorded in a shed on a guitar that Jimi Hendrix once looked at will have instant superiority to, say, Ariana Grande’s Into You. I have listened to that roughly several hundred times and never tired of it, and it came out in 2016, thus proving Acaster entirely right.Billie Eilish, whose minimal goth-pop is surely the oddest sound to break big in quite some time, has become the first artist born this millennium to have a US Billboard Top 100 number one. The brilliant creeping loop of Bad Guy has knocked Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road off the top spot, where it had been sitting for an astonishing 19 weeks. Finally, that horse can have a well-earned rest.It’s been quite the week for Eilish, who, at 17, seems to be made up entirely of long shorts, neon and world-weary wisdom. In a conversation with Pharrell Williams, for V magazine, Williams asked Eilish if there were any big misconceptions about her.She talked about being praised for her baggy clothes, for her “not necessarily feminine, or girly” style and how that comes with an element of shaming other young women who choose not to dress as she does.“I have always supported and fucked with and just loved when a woman or a man or anyone in the world feels comfortable in their skin, their body, to show just whatever they want,” she said. To quote the inimitable Bad Guy: “Duh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92ecd17105b0f6589516d16c5ce5870780690854/0_71_4852_2912/master/4852.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4f5156699dffcce0ff9e7dd96bdc24b","title":"no deal brexit the fourth horseman of the apocalypse cartoon","story":"Look who’s trotting up to join climate change, global recession and war…• You can buy your own print of this cartoon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a21a1caeacb5822cafaaf2101e450a3219032bd/111_190_3384_2031/master/3384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8591c7f4ee44b6d6fdd482f6431c077e","title":"game of thrones star kit harington joins marvels the eternals","story":"Actor to enter MCU franchise as part of 2020 superhero film alongside Angelina Jolie Game of Thrones star Kit Harington will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of superhero group The Eternals, Disney has announced.

Everyone should have the chance to climb the education ladder, without unfair advantage to those in private schools.”Responding to FoIs requests from Powell, only Cambridge University among the 24 Russell Group universities said it did not take exam results at key stage 4 (14-16 years) into account when deciding which students to admit. The other 23 said they did take them into account and made no distinction between the two.Powell, a former shadow education secretary, called on the government to act to ensure state school pupils were no longer disadvantaged in the race for places at top universities. She said: “It’s an absolute scandal that it is easier to get top grades in IGCSEs than in the new GCSEs, yet universities essentially class them as the same. State schools do an excellent job – often in difficult circumstances, and now with reduced funding – to help young people get the best GCSE results they can. There’s been a lot of turmoil with the new system, which private schools, by shirking away from the new GCSEs, have shielded their pupils from.”She called on ministers and Ofqual, the exam regulator, to conduct an urgent review of admissions criteria in order to restore fairness and direct universities to ensure the tough new GCSEs were properly counted.Peter Hyman, founder of School 21, a state-funded school for children aged four-18 in east London, said: “Private schools already have a lot stacked in their favour. To have a two-tier system in which no account is taken of the fact that one system is harder is obviously wrong.”Earlier this year the chair of Ofqual, Roger Taylor, told the education select committee that the current system “is not conducive to public trust in the examination system”. A spokesman for Ofqual said last night: “People should be careful when using GCSE and International GCSEs interchangeably … However, we recognise that such precise comparison might not be an issue for everyone. Universities and employers are used to seeing many different qualifications on applications and deciding what value they place on them.”The Department for Education, which reformed the GCSE system when Michael Gove was education secretary, admits that the new exams are more rigorous than those still widely used in the private sector.When the Observer first raised the issue last December the DfE said: “International GCSEs have not been through the same regulatory approval and quality control as the new gold-standard GCSEs, which is why we no longer recognise international GCSEs in school performance tables. The new GCSE qualifications have been reformed to provide more rigorous content, so young people are taught the knowledge and skills they need for future study and employment.”A DfE spokesperson said this weekend: “Independent schools are by definition independent and make their own decisions about what qualifications to offer. If a school decides to offer international GCSEs instead of reformed 9-to-1 GCSEs, it will not get credit for them in performance tables. This is because we want to ensure pupils benefit from reformed 9-to-1 GCSEs, which are the gold standard qualification at 16, in line with expected standards in countries with high performing education systems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ad51b372b68d19223ea4fb9e078297d238438a5/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab66bd09e0785bcfa742fb165977828e","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Endangered white rhinos, breeding cycads and fires in the Amazon rainforest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/183736d87e7c55223c5118740f57ab8df16edd80/928_342_3727_2236/master/3727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb3935479fa4df327a8a4111b6a1d617","title":"bollywood to depict indian air strikes on pakistan over kashmir bombing","story":"Vivek Oberoi movie will tell ‘true story’ of reprisals after February attack in which 40 Indian troops were killedBollywood is to make a movie based on the “true story” of Indian air strikes on Pakistan this year, its producer said, the latest patriotic film to hit the silver screen.The 26 February attack took place after a suicide bombing claimed by a militant group based in Pakistan killed 40 Indian troops on 14 February in Indian-controlled Kashmir.Pakistan then carried out its own raid over the de-facto border in Kashmir, before the two nuclear-armed countries stepped back from the brink of another conflict.India said that in the raid, its aircraft successfully attacked a training camp at Balakot and killed “a very large number” of “terrorists”, but doubts have been raised about its efficacy.At the time, Imran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, said India’s claim that it had hit the Balakot camp was “a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim”.The new movie is set to be produced by Vivek Oberoi, who starred in a flattering biopic of prime minister Narendra Modi, the release of which was delayed so as not to interfere with this year’s election.It will also tell the story of handlebar-moustached Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian pilot who was shot down in the raid and then handed over by Pakistan, becoming a national hero.“This film is a powerful tool to underline the achievements of brave officers like Wing Commander Abhinandan, who went behind the enemy lines and did what makes every Indian proud of them,” Oberoi was quoted as saying by Indian media.Kashmir has been ided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947.

Founded in 2013, the group claim to “refine” satanism “as a weapon in the ongoing culture wars”, positioning themselves as a counterbalancing force against evangelical Christianity and the pernicious conflation of church and state.“I used to be a zesty little atheist,” smirks a new believer. But being an atheist is boring, he insists. There’s no community, no code of ethics. Indeed, the community Lane zeroes in on is one of charming, articulate oddballs with his glass eye and reasonable baritone, co-founder Lucien Greaves, in particular, is a charismatic antihero.Though she takes her subjects seriously, Lane allows herself to be led by her sense of humour. A statue of a 10ft goat-headed demon – a monument to Satan, set to reside next to the Ten Commandments monument in Little Rock, Arkansas – is a provocative middle finger to the widespread acceptance of religious iconography. An anti-anti-abortion rally that sees the satanists dress as fetish-inspired adult babies is even funnier. “The meaning is a bit lost on us,” says an innocent passer-by. It’s no accident that Lane titles her film Hail Satan?, opting for a curious question mark rather than an ecstatic exclamation point.

Better yet is sweetcorn so fresh, it needn’t be cooked at all.Tempting as it is to leave sweetcorn to its own devices, I cannot help but push further, creating whole meals that contrast between sweet and savoury, and the delicious space that opens up when they’re considerately paired. Corn husks are like nature’s little foil packets, only better. They allow the kernels to cook in their own steam and not dry out while they’re on the grill and, at the same time, take on the burning husks’ smoky aroma.Make sure you use the freshest corn you can find, because this really makes all the difference when cooking them in this way. If you can’t get corn cobs in their husks, blanch them lightly before grilling them and then spread with the dressing.4 corns on the cob, husks on2 tbsp parsley, roughly choppedFor the dressing2 large egg yolks1 tsp dijon mustard1½ tbsp lemon juice2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 anchovies, roughly chopped35g pecorino, finely grated, plus extra finely grated to serveBlack pepper100ml sunflower oil, plus extra for greasingMake the dressing: add the egg yolks, mustard, lemon, garlic, anchovies, pecorino and a very generous amount of black pepper to a food processor, and pulse a few times until well combined. With the machine running, drizzle in the oil in a slow and steady stream until completely incorporated and the dressing has a mayonnaise-like consistency.Put a well-greased large griddle pan on to a high heat, or light up your barbecue. Prepare the corn on the cob by gently pulling back the husks, leaving them attached at the base discard the silk by pulling at the threads.Rub a heaped tablespoon of the dressing on to each of the cobs, smoothing it out to coat the kernels. Pull up the husks to encase the corn again (don’t worry if some of it is exposed) and, once the grill is smoking, grill the corn, turning from time to time, until the husks are completely charred and the insides are tender – 15-20 minutes.To serve, pull down the husks again, and rub all over with some more of the dressing. Finish with a sprinkling of extra pecorino and the parsley, and serve with any extra dressing alongside.Tamales are little Mexican parcels of joy, made with maize flour (masa harina), wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves and steamed. I use baking paper, because it’s much easier to work with, but do try the husks if you don’t mind the challenge.

Cook for three minutes, stirring a few times, until the corn is cooked through and has the consistency of porridge.Remove from the heat and leave to cool for five minutes, then add the masa harina, oil, baking powder and egg, and mix well it should have the consistency of Play-Doh.Cut six rectangles of baking paper, each 25 x 16cm. With lightly oiled hands, take 110g of the dough and shape into a smooth ball. Put this ball in the middle of one of the paper pieces, and flatten into a 15 x 9cm rectangle.Combine the cheeses in a small bowl with the remaining teaspoon of cumin, then place 20g cheese mixture along the centre of the dough. Use your hands to mould the dough over to enclose the cheese on all sides, pinching and smoothing the dough with your fingers so there are no cracks, to get a 12 x 6cm rectangle. Fold the paper on all sides to enclose the tamale, using the paper to help you shape it, then put the parcel seam-side down on a tray. Repeat with the rest of the dough.Put a large saucepan, for which you have a fitted steaming basket and lid, on a high heat with plenty of water. Once boiling, put the tamales seam-side down in the steaming basket (you may have to pile some on top of each other, which is fine). Cover with the lid, turn the heat to medium and steam for 30 minutes. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then unwrap and discard the paper.Serve the tamales on a platter with the chilli oil drizzled on top and lime wedges to squeeze alongside.The cured egg yolk, which is a cinch to make, adds richness and colour to this meal in a bowl. I urge you to try it in polentas and pastas, even if you’re not going to make this whole dish. The polenta will set quite quickly, so it is best made just before serving. Roast and marinate the peppers up to three days before, if you like.70ml soy sauce4 good-quality, rich-yolk eggs12 small, mixed red, orange and yellow Romano peppers, stalks on (ie 1.1kg)Salt and black pepper1 whole garlic bulb, top trimmed to expose the cloves, plus 2 extra cloves, skin left on and crushed with the side of a knife1 tbsp maple syrup1 tsp apple cider vinegar10g thyme sprigs1 lemon, zest finely grated to get ½ tsp, remaining skin finely shaved, to get 5 strips60ml olive oil, plus extra to serve5g basil, finely shreddedFor the polenta4-6 small fresh corn cobs, kernels shaved off (500g), or 500g frozen corn kernels, defrosted 40g unsalted butter180g Greek-style yoghurt40g parmesan, finely grated, plus extra to serve100g quick-cook polentaPut the soy sauce in a medium bowl. Separate the eggs, carefully adding the yolks to the bowl of soy sauce (save the whites for another recipe) and leave the yolks to cure for two and a half hours, very gently turning them halfway with a spoon. Don’t cure the yolks for any longer you want them to stay soft.Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Put the peppers on a large, paper-lined tray, spreading out as much as possible. Sprinkle the whole garlic bulb with a little salt and pepper , wrap tightly in foil and add to the tray with the peppers. Roast for 20 minutes, then carefully turn the peppers over and roast for another 10 minutes, until cooked through and blackened in places.Put the peppers in a large bowl with the crushed raw garlic, maple syrup, vinegar, thyme, lemon skin, oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Once cool enough to handle, unwrap the cooked garlic and squeeze the cloves out into the bowl with the peppers, discarding the papery skin. Gently mix this into the peppers, keeping the stalks intact, cover with a large plate and leave to marinate for at least an hour, or overnight.While the peppers are marinating, add the corn to a food processor and blitz to a wet paste. Transfer to a large saute pan with the butter, yoghurt, parmesan, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and 500ml water. Cook for seven minutes on a medium heat, then turn the heat to low. Sprinkle in the polenta, stirring constantly for another five minutes to avoid lumps, until cooked.Divide the polenta between four bowls, then top with three peppers each, drizzling some of the marinade over, but avoiding the aromatics. Carefully lift a yolk out of the soy sauce and place on the polenta, next to the peppers. Finish with a good drizzle of oil, along with the basil, lemon zest, a sprinkle of salt, a good grind of pepper and some freshly grated parmesan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/128aa4a50304e8203f8ded3a8ae44c414d885c2a/0_33_5568_3342/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc75cf87290f33525ea00503967f680a","title":"efl bury 5pm tuesday campbell takeover","story":"The English Football League has given Bury until Tuesday for their owner, Steve Dale, to conclude a sale or the club will be expelled from the league after 125 years.Dale received a takeover offer in principle on Friday night from the directors of a sporting data and analytics company, C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk, including Rory Campbell, son of the former Labour party communications director Alastair.In a statement released after the EFL board took time to consider the news yesterday afternoon, the league said it was not prepared to extend the deadline beyond Tuesday at 5pm because of the impact on the season.In a later statement, the EFL also expressed its concern at the continued uncertainty at Bolton, giving the League One club the same deadline. The statement said: “Having been previously advised in writing on the morning of the start of the season that the deal was all but agreed and only awaiting completion signatures, there has been constant contradictory information and no finalisation of the deal.“The current situation cannot continue and the time to resolve the current impasse is now fast running out … If a successful conclusion to a sale is not found or there are no credible plans for the Club to continue the season in administration by the planned Board meeting at 5pm on Tuesday 27 August 2019, then the EFL Board will consider lifting the suspension on the notice of withdrawal of the club’s membership of the League which was issued when the club entered into administration in May 2019.”The EFL has suspended Bury’s first five scheduled matches in League One because of Dale’s failure, since his £1 takeover of the club in December, to provide the evidence required by league rules that he has the funding for the club to meet its commitments.The EFL’s executive chair, Debbie Jevans, emphasised on Thursday that it will already be difficult for those five fixtures to be rescheduled given the crowded calendar of a 24-club ision, hence the board’s refusal to allow any further postponement of matches for extended takeover negotiations.In a statement made on Friday night Campbell, 32, and Henry Newman, 30, the directors of C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk, said they had been in discussions for 10 weeks about buying Bury, but they needed an extension to the midnight deadline because “it is a very complicated scenario and there remain a number of outstanding legal and other issues that have to be addressed”.Having considered that position on Saturday morning, the EFL said in its statement: “The board has fully considered the information that has been made available by C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk and, whilst no formal sale has been completed, despite reports to the contrary, enough credible information was presented to allow the board to agree to work exclusively with the club and C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk over this bank holiday weekend in an attempt to finalise the change of control and achieve a positive outcome for Bury FC.“The EFL board, however, remains firmly of the view that the League cannot be in a position whereby any more of the club’s 2019-20 fixtures will be suspended due to the integrity of the competition and the impact on other clubs in the League and therefore has stated that matters must be concluded by 5pm on Tuesday 27 August 2019.“If in the event a successful outcome is not achieved by this point, then Bury FC’s share in the EFL will be withdrawn and its membership in the League will come to an end.”Jevans described this extension of four days over the bank holiday as “a final effort to allow the club the opportunity to survive”.While the extension was welcomed by Bury supporters who had reacted with increasing alarm and distress at the prospect of their club being thrown out of the league and probably folding, the four-day deadline remains challenging and many questions remain.While Campbell, previously a technical scout and analyst at West Ham United, and Newman, a coach and former joint manager of Barnet, said they had been in discussions for 10 weeks, Dale himself had said that until Friday he has had no detailed negotiations with them. As Campbell and Newman made clear, there are layers of complexity and huge problems at Bury, and they must themselves satisfy the EFL they are “fit and proper” to take over, although they are said to have provided proof of funds to the league – and reassure Bury supporters about their competence, finance and plans.Bury, formed in 1885, are in financial ruins, with a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) needing finance to pay “non-football creditors” 25p in the pound out of £4m they are owed, around £750,000 to current and former players and other football creditors, and expected £1.5m losses for the season. Dale has said that a further £1.75m must be paid under the CVA to a company, RCR Holdings Ltd, which bought an apparent £7m debt owed by Bury for £70,000, and now wants a quarter of the full £7m alongside other creditors.RCR Holdings was formed two days before the club’s 18 July creditors meeting at which it voted to pass the CVA, and the sole owner and director, Kris Richards, 41, is Dale’s daughter’s partner. There is also a £3.7m mortgage on Gigg Lane taken out by the former owner Stewart Day, several of whose property companies were about to collapse when he hastily sold the club to Dale for £1 nine months ago.The Bury North MP James Frith, who has worked intensively to find a solution for the club, criticised the EFL for granting so short a time for a deal to complete: “I fear the extension is not long enough with so much still to be done,” he said.“Technically the EFL have narrowed and shortened the road they might have handed us. For now we must trust that the new owners and current owner work in their best interests and ours to get this over the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0236a036a8337589f877b73dbeb6bdad8d607446/0_117_2936_1761/master/2936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8695594602d1597fc16105355d318fa1","title":"liverpool arsenal premier league match report","story":"In the context of Arsenal’s lamentable record in this stadium this was actually an improved performance, whatever the scoreline might suggest. They were worn down in the end by a Liverpool side that started ponderously but eventually found their rhythm and confidence, with Mohamed Salah enjoying one of his most effective games for a while, though until David Luiz went into malfunction mode in the second half there was little to choose between the two teams at the top of the Premier League table.Liverpool’s overall strategy was clear from the outset: they kept switching the ball from left to right in the hope that either Andy Robertson or Trent Alexander-Arnold could get behind Arsenal’s defence on the flanks. This is a plan that normally works – and Robertson almost found Roberto Firmino in front of goal with a firmly driven cross-shot in the first couple of minutes – but while both full-backs saw plenty of the ball the final delivery was not quite up to the usual standard. Alexander-Arnold in particular was wasteful in the first half, and after surviving the expected pounding in the first 15 minutes Arsenal began to grow in confidence and ask some attacking questions of their own.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could have opened the scoring when a mix-up between Adrián and Virgil van Dijk saw the goalkeeper’s attempted clearance land at his feet, but his looping attempt from the edge of the area drifted narrowly wide of an unguarded net. Then Nicolas Pépé, his first start for Arsenal already decorated by an alert spin to wrongfoot the normally unflappable Van Dijk, brought the first real save of the game from Adrián, albeit a routine one from a shot that lacked venom.This was a much better start than Arsenal usually make at Anfield, with the visitors managing to live up to Jürgen Klopp’s extravagant pre-match billing. Not only did t: he Liverpool manager describe them as one of the best teams in Europe, he said it was silly to brand the Premier League as a two-horse race when a team of such quality is on the rise under a manager as capable as Unai Emery.This might have come as news to many Arsenal supporters, though Klopp was also correct in predicting that Pépé’s pace would cause Liverpool problems. The new signing from Lille shot fractionally wide after getting on the end of a move that saw Joe Willock whisk past Alexander-Arnold on the left as if the defender was not there, and two minutes later his pace left Robertson chasing shadows too, this time the winger putting a tame shot too close to Adrián.So although it was no surprise when Liverpool took the lead from a set-piece five minutes before the interval, it was perhaps against the run of play. Sadio Mané had brought a save from Bernd Leno and Salah had shot the wrong side of an upright, but Liverpool were not exactly pummelling their opponents when Alexander-Arnold swung over a corner from the right that Joël Matip headed in from six yards. Replays supported Mattéo Guendouzi’s argument that Liverpool players had in effect held him in a headlock, yet there was no VAR intervention despite the fact that several minutes had been wasted at the preceding corner in checking whether an alleged Nacho Monreal offence was worthy of a red card.By half-time corners were becoming a problem for Arsenal, with Alexander-Arnold’s crossing of a dead ball as accurate as ever. On the stroke of the interval he picked out an unmarked Mané, who beat the ground in frustration after sending a free header over the bar.Arsenal needed to score first in the second half to make a game of it, or at least keep Liverpool at bay for as long as possible, yet they managed to self-destruct just two minutes after the restart. When Alexander-Arnold slipped a pass through to Salah in the area David Luiz was tugging the striker’s shirt so blatantly that he gave a curt little salute to Anthony Taylor as an admission of guilt. The Brazilian then had the nerve to look aggrieved, along with the rest of the Arsenal defenders, when the referee pointed to the spot. The foul was as clear as it was unnecessary and Salah made Arsenal pay, smacking his spot kick firmly into Leno’s top right corner.If David Luiz thought his afternoon could not get any worse he was badly mistaken. Salah beat him so completely on the right touchline he was left careering off the pitch with his hands raised in surrender, while the Liverpool player scampered gratefully into an empty penalty area to beat Leno with a confident low shot.While David Luiz might have done better, it was risky for Arsenal to play with such a high line against such a fast-breaking side. Lucas Torreira scored a close-range consolation goal to deny Liverpool their first clean sheet of the season, though with Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain getting a run-out before the end, the league leaders had little else to complain about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f1400a744ce75a85afe690ce595a51a66bb50bc/0_920_2798_1678/master/2798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fa6700f648ec7e0b6e6221025976a15","title":"manchester united crystal palace premier league match report","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær said he was “lost for words” regarding the racial abuse directed at Marcus Rashford on Twitter after the Manchester United forward missed a 70th-minute penalty.This was the second spot-kick United had spurned in five days after Paul Pogba had one saved at Wolves on Monday, for which he was also targeted in a similar manner on the social media platform.Rashford failed to convert with the score 1-0 to the visitors. Though United did equalise, a late Patrick van Aanholt strike grabbed Crystal Palace a first league win at Old Trafford since 1989.Solskjær said of the abuse his No 10 received: “It’s the same as we spoke about before the weekend. It’s unheard of, it needs to stop and I’m just lost for the words. If it keeps going, keep having all these campaigns, ‘no to racism’ and they keep hiding behind fake IDs … and it’s crazy we talk about this in 2019.”United dominated throughout but, as at Molineux, lacked a killer touch in front of goal. At half-time they trailed to a Jordan Ayew goal yet, when Daniel James curled home in the 89th minute, Solskjær’s men seemed to have earned a draw.But Pogba then ceded possession and Palace drove upfield, setting up Van Aanholt to beat David de Gea from close range in added time.Here the price was paid for United’s laxity, though they might have had at least one more penalty when Anthony Martial appeared to be brought down by Martin Kelly in the second half and Rashford, in a separate incident, was also felled inside the area.“I think we were unlucky with Martial’s clear and obvious penalty. It’s a nailed-on one and, when the ref sees the game, he’ll know he’s not had his best,” Solskjær said of Paul Tierney. “It’s a nailed-on pen, he won’t slip if he doesn’t have a 100-kilo centre-back on his shoulders.The manager also believed Gary Cahill should have been sent off when Martial, this time just outside the penalty area, was fouled by the Palace debutant as the interval neared. Instead the defender was given a yellow card.For Roy Hodgson there was only enjoyment at being the first Palace manager in the Premier League era to mastermind victory at United. “I was unaware of that nugget,” he said. “We showed a lot of ability in desire, concentration and performance. We are very happy with our victory. It was hard work. The players showed incredible concentration. I was hoping the ball would break on the counter. It was a long, hot afternoon. We always try to go for a winner.”Palace’s goals were their first of the season and they had gone into the game with only one point from their two matches. Hodgson added: “If you judge games on possession or corners then people would say we did not deserve it but we are Crystal Palace and, looking at our team and our performance, of course we deserved to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d12380c0d4bec6c1e864f1d9e579bc82a2b5f8b/0_895_8748_5251/master/8748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcfde6be089faf64378c1a26fa0a476b","title":"my concrete jungle home in london","story":"A rundown old school has become a grand home to plants, birds, two dogs – and one artistWhen photographer Steph Wilson first stepped into the south London school that was to become her home, it was a sometime squat, dark and rundown, the walls black with mould. She shudders at the memory. Three years later she has turned it into a grand church to plantlife, an urban conservatory that appears illuminated by stage lights.Wilson moved in when she was 24, after the death of her father – “a bouncer, a drug dealer, an actor – oh, and he was in the SAS”. It was an investment her family bought the place both as a home for Wilson and her many pets, and for the studio space, which she rents out for fashion shoots. The light is extremely soft, the ceilings extremely high – the other potential buyer was a professional trampolinist.When she moved in she ripped up the lino, got rid of the mould, installed heating and a new kitchen, built an aviary for her 12 canaries and four Gouldian finches, another for the parrot, installed a tank for her goldfish and started to accumulate plants. Some came from Conservatory Archives in east London, some from friends, and some from Gumtree, including the cactus that had grown out of its previous home, and which she had to lop a branch off of in order to get it through the door.It’s beneath the hanging baskets, in her living room – “my colonial-style hotel lobby” – that Wilson sits on the antique three-piece suite (“I got everything from Newark antiques fair – all my furniture came to less than the price of my mattress”) with her two dogs, and watches sunlight stream through the glass ceiling. “The grand finale is when the afternoon sun hits the large canvas of cadmium red I hung over the dining table,” she sighs happily. In the back room beside a deep blue sofa, an antique armoire offers a pedestal for her miniature cacti, and some sprout cheekily from the drawers. Every surface contains a jumble of vintage planters containing the next generation of plantlife, pictures and boxes of birdseed.At the other end of the space is the kitchen, where a lone frond of ivy whispers its way towards the hob. Open shelves display a jumble of teapots and cups. The dark green cabinets, made bespoke by Naked Kitchens, reflect her jungle of plantlife, as do the 1970s tiles in the bathroom, laid in the palest of pink walls. A vast studio to the right of the front door is strewn with her canvases and the props from a recent photoshoot.Yet there is not a great deal of art on Wilson’s walls instead, the focus is on the greenery that, as you walk through the cavernous house, feels less like a collection of pot plants and more like pets, or sculptures, or stragglers from a very good party. Beneath the white staircase stands a well-used piano, and the steps above hang with dried flowers. Upstairs are two bedrooms, where leaves tumble from the ceiling. “My most pathetic pleasure was finding a bedspread that matched the plant.”A tea towel-sized private garden is tended sporadically by her mum, and it opens on to a vast communal lawn, shared by a close collection of neighbours, who live in separate buildings that once made up the school. Though a minute’s walk from the front door, the screech and rush of the high street feels far away. Living here, Wilson says, has taught her she’s “good at keeping things alive”. Including, it turns out, herself. She used to suffer badly from anxiety and panic attacks: there was a period, in a previous home, when she couldn’t leave the house. But here, she says: “I’ve created a pod away from anxiety. It’s rooted in escape. All my friends come round and say they’re cured by lying on my rug. The birds are a living lava lamp.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6337c103d30420317a9943ca7d8c38e80e9f89/464_0_4776_2867/master/4776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d525df878f17d121f8e90492ee43c7c","title":"the best beaches in nice and cote dazur france","story":"From the palm-fringed beaches of Cannes, to the chilled vibe of Plage de la Salis, the Côte d’Azur has beaches to suit every tastePlage de la Bocca, CannesAway from Cannes’ many private beaches is the sandy stretch of Plage de la Bocca, west of the city.

The study concluded that elite athletes had poor oral health despite efforts to care for their teeth.Previous findings have suggested elite athletes may have a higher risk of oral disease because of having a dry mouth during intensive training.Dr Julie Gallagher, from the institute, said: “We found that a majority of the athletes in our survey already have good oral health-related habits in as much as they brush their teeth twice a day, visit the dentist regularly, don’t smoke and have a healthy general diet.“However, they use sports drinks, energy gels and bars frequently during training and competition the sugar in these products increases the risk of tooth decay and the acidity of them increases the risk of erosion. This could be contributing to the high levels of tooth decay and acid erosion we saw during the dental check-ups.”Gallagher said the athletes interviewed for the study were willing to consider behaviour changes, such as additional fluoride use from mouthwash, more frequent dental visits and reducing their intake of sports drinks, to improve oral health.Researchers went on to work with the elite athletes and their support team members to design an oral health intervention study."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d29d0f56568c4a80e046e785e67baa5e2ea4dd5/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b98c76f797762fe517bb8d1ceaf97af","title":"hrt shortage uk women","story":"Doctors say HRT is becoming difficult to prescribe because of supply crisisMedical experts are calling for action to resolve the national shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products used to treat menopausal symptoms.The shortage is causing difficulties for thousands of women in the UK, medical experts have said.In a joint statement, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), the British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) said they were receiving multiple queries from women unable to get HRT products.About half of the most commonly prescribed HRT products, which replace hormones, including oestrogen, that naturally decline during the menopause, are out of stock. The high street pharmacies Boots and Lloyds are among those said to be experiencing shortages.Doctors were also reporting that HRT was becoming difficult to prescribe because of the shortages.Prof Lesley Regan, the president of the RCOG, said: “We are very concerned that thousands of women are struggling to get their HRT prescriptions, or even prescriptions for alternative treatments. HRT is essential for many women to ensure that they are able to continue to lead a high-quality life.”The crisis reportedly started in late 2018 when supply issues that began in China forced some manufacturers to stop producing HRT patches. This resulted in increased demand for other brands, which in turn became scarce.Shortages are expected to continue until next year.Haitham Hamoda, a consultant gynaecologist and chair of the BMS, said women experiencing difficulties needed to be offered support and advice on how to get supplies of their HRT medications.“The British Menopause Society has advised prescribers to find equivalent types by looking at the oestrogen and progestogen component and matching it as closely as possible to another brand,” he said.“Beyond this, we need to understand the reasons behind this and what measures could be taken to resolve this issue and to prevent it happening again in the future.”Dr Asha Kasliwal, the president of the FSRH, said she was treating women every week who had been affected by the shortage. “These women are not being able to receive the treatment that best suits their needs, leaving some women to cope with quite debilitating symptoms that directly impact on their daily lives,” she said.“It is important that the Department of Health and Social Care continues to work with suppliers of HRT medicines. We need to ensure that women are not disadvantaged further because of the shortage, and that they access HRT treatment when they need it.”The DHSC said it was aware of the ongoing supply issues. A spokesperson said: “We are working closely with all suppliers to maintain overall flow of medicines to patients.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

When England were 15 for two in their seventh over with another 344 runs required for victory and 70 overs to be bowled in the day, swift exit possibilities were being explored. Now other possibilities, more unlikely but much more intriguing, have surfaced. In their pursuit of 359 for victory England were 156 for three at the close with Joe Root on home turf attempting to play the innings of his life. At stumps he was unbeaten on 75, which already constitutes his innings of the series.Nagging away at the back of the mind is the thought, “This is Headingley”. Extraordinary things happen here in the fourth innings, which have involved a wide variety of protagonists: Donald Bradman, Bob Willis, Mark Butcher and Shai Hope spring to mind. On Saturday afternoon England looked to their ordinary Joes to join this list. At least Messrs Root and Denly, to borrow some Strine, have been “pretty bloody ordinary” up until now.But in sun-kissed Leeds in front of a packed stadium who seemed to enjoy the occasion despite the absence of sixes or fireworks, there was something out of the ordinary as they battled to keep this match alive. After all, they batted together for 53 overs, almost twice as long as the entire team managed in the first innings, grinding out 136 runs in the process. They received a curious standing ovation when they registered a hundred partnership.The Joes had opted for the hard route out of the rut, the red ball route rather than the white. They grafted they shunned wide deliveries they blocked the straight ones and painstakingly gleaned their runs against an unrelenting Australia attack. After 50 overs, when it is customary to make a note, England’s score was 125 for two, an unusual state of affairs in this World Cup summer.The Joes were separated midway through the final session during another exceptional spell from Josh Hazlewood. Denly had been peppered with short deliveries throughout his innings, especially from Pat Cummins. Sometimes he ducked calmly, at others he fended in some discomfort and, as so often happens now, he was hit on the helmet as well. Throughout he remained resolute, moving into line and deflecting his runs amid the odd wayward drive. He has played many more beautiful innings in county cricket but few gutsier ones and he has never batted in such a tense situation. In the end a bouncer surprised him – partly because Hazlewood does not bowl so many – and he gloved a catch to the keeper.Root, meanwhile, reminded us why he is a class above the rest of England’s batsmen he had a fraction more time to decide how to cope with those shorter deliveries. Once he had avoided his pair – with an early cut shot off his recent tormentor, Hazlewood, he settled in to play an innings of old-style discretion. There were no expansive drives but many soft deflections on either side of the wicket. He let the ball come to him and usually he had enough time to deal with it. Like Denly he was prepared to play the long game, to try to wear down his opponents, not that the Australians at any stage suggested that they were running out of fuel.Their bowlers certainly started at full throttle. Rory Burns soon edged a steep lifter from Hazlewood into the increasingly safe hands of David Warner at slip. Then Jason Roy was bowled by a trimmer from Cummins, which clipped the top of his off-stump.So a fast game was in prospect. Batting still seemed a trial out there even when the Australians were at the crease. They managed to add another 75 in the morning but with enough uncertainty to suggest that the match might be over by the close.Ben Stokes was selected to accompany Stuart Broad at the start and he would bowl throughout the session, which meant that, apart from a four-ball interruption from Jofra Archer on Friday night, he ran in from the Rugby Stand End for 24 consecutive overs. The impression was that Root may have struggled to remove the ball from his hands even if he had wanted a change from that end.England looked grumpy out there, not surprisingly given their situation Marnus Labuschagne, such a familiar figure now, was still calm and measured in between being hit on the head by a cricket ball – he took two more blows in the morning session – and he remained a formidable obstacle. On 60 he gave a tough chance to Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broad that fell to ground. Broad did not quite succeed in hiding his disappointment as he flicked the ball along the ground to his keeper at the end of the over.It looked like another one of those days especially after the donation of four overthrows – fortunately off the bowling of Archer, which meant that there were no volcanic eruptions out there. Then, after starting gingerly, Archer found the edge of James Pattinson’s bat and Root took the catch. Stokes’s sweat was justifiably rewarded with the wicket of Cummins, who was fending off a short delivery.Soon Labuschagne became the first batsman in the series to be run out. A square drive sped out to Denly on the point boundary. There was a misfield, but only a little one, which encouraged Labuschagne back for a second Denly gathered the ball and his throw was swift and straight into the gloves of Bairstow who gathered the ball smoothly. To mild surprise Labuschagne was a couple of inches from home when the bails were removed. Soon Nathan Lyon was bowled off the bottom edge by Archer, the 13th wicket of his brief Test career. The target was set. It is a formidable one. But we are still here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93bd4f662c1e938c1f17aa0613a06824330285d1/100_391_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b856589c0926080200cec67a7146a02b","title":"joe root england inner boycott ashes third test","story":"It was hot in the sunshine at Headingley and by two o’clock a lot of the spectators were sheltering in the shadows under the Western Terrace. There was not a scrap of cover out in the middle then, where Joe Root, horribly exposed, was just starting out on one of the most important innings of his career. Root was playing to prove he is still one of the world’s best batsman, that he can be that even while he is leading the team and, more important still, for a shot at what could be his last, distant chance at winning an Ashes series as captain. He knew it, too, and would have had all that and plenty else running around his head all morning.This is the eighth Test England have played against Australia under Root they have lost five and drawn two of the other seven. With a record like that, Root knows there is no guarantee he will still be England captain by the time the team go back to Australia in 2021. Losing an Ashes series over there is one thing, being beaten back in England another. Right now there is no certainty he will still be in the job this winter, when England will have a new head coach with his own ideas about what has gone wrong with the team in the last few years and whether Root is the right captain to fix it.So one way or another, this was going to be a career-defining innings. It is not the first he has played at Headingley. Back in the spring of 2013 Root made his very first Test century here, 104 against New Zealand. He was 22 then, but so baby-faced that he was asked for ID every time he tried to buy a pint. If he looked young for 22 then, he looks old for 28 now. The England captaincy will do that. Back at the start of the Test summer Root said he would be lying if he denied he was feeling tired, and there was no point trying to kid the press anyway, since the black bags and crows feet gave him away.Root has played a lot of international cricket in the last six years: 320 innings altogether – more than any other player – and he has faced almost 20,000 balls, nearly a quarter as many again as two of the four other great batsmen of this generation, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. Virat Kohli is the only one who gets close. Right now, Root is the only one of the four whose Test average has fallen below the fifty watershed. It falls all the way from 53 to 42 when he has been captain. Root’s game has frayed and worn, Watching his strange field placings in this series, it was beginning to feel as if his leadership was not worth what it costs in runs lost.Right now Root looks as if he needs rest almost as much as he does runs. He surely did not get much sleep on Friday night. He has spoken before about how he often finds himself lying awake at night during games, and what happened on Friday left him plenty to stew on. He has looked as if he has been running on empty since Edgbaston, when he gave all of himself in that first innings of the series, batting three hours for 57 runs. But since then he has made 28, 14, 0 and 0, the first time in his life he has made ducks in back-to-back matches. He is in the thick of the worst year of his career. He was averaging 27 from 13 innings when he came in here.England were reeling at the time, too, at 15 for two. He was on a pair and Josh Hazlewood thought he had him with his second ball, which landed, of course, on a length outside off-stump. Root leaned into it and it whizzed just by the edge of his bat, which had clipped his pad. Hazlewood mistook the one noise for the other, and launched into a long, loud appeal, which umpire Gaffaney refused. Two balls later Root played a jittery little squirt through the slips that skittered away to third man for three runs. He bounded gleefully down the pitch for those first runs.Root set himself, then, for the grim and serious business of batting through the afternoon. He scored two fours in the next 23 overs, both of them off the outside edge, one wide through gully off Hazlewood, the other past slip off James Pattinson, who mistakenly thought he had him lbw later in the innings, too. Otherwise, he blocked a lot, left plenty and picked up singles where he could. There was one loose drive but otherwise it was brilliantly bloody-minded stuff, an innings of Boycottian obstinacy.Finally Root unfurled a fine cover drive off Nathan Lyon to bring up his fifty, next ball, he flicked four more fine behind to leg. After those back-to-back boundaries, he settled again, until, on 64 he played a reverse sweep for four off Lyon, finely calculated to take best advantage of the width the bowler had offered him. He walked off at the end, unbeaten on 75 from 189 balls. Exhausted as he must have been, it is a fair guess he will not have slept much on Saturday night either. There was too much left to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aaa8612799cfb5f4c84f3bc48aa2595509764b0/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29cf21c2743bd2cdb1c465b8db482fbc","title":"manu tuilagi england ireland","story":"The Leicester man turns on the power at Twickenham with an outstanding display in the No 13 shirtIt may seem strange to single out one player after such an imperious England performance across the board but Manu Tuilagi is someone worth making an exception for. There have been countless days over the past five years when a performance such as this seemed beyond the realms of possibility. Just this week he laid bare the extent of his injury struggles and how hiding one of them cost him more than a year of his career. Suffice it to say it is good to see him back and firing like this.Granted, this was his ninth straight appearance for England but we have seen his power, his pace and his poise only in glimpses. That can no longer be considered the case. He was not alone but he typified England’s intensity, their ability to burst over the gainline and such is the obvious joy Tuilagi takes from playing international rugby that it must be infectious.For Tuilagi loves playing for England, all the more so against Ireland, and it was eight years ago that he ran amok in Dublin when winning only his second cap, rubber-stamping his place at the 2011 World Cup aged only 20.In February this year, Tuilagi made his first England start in five years and made a considerable impact after less than two minutes, taking Jamie George’s over-the-top lineout and thundering into the Ireland defence.Yesterday, Ross Byrne acquitted himself well on his first Test start but he may live to regret directing his kick-off at Tuilagi, who fielded it and rampaged into his opponents. Eddie Jones is these days non-committal when asked whether Tuilagi is better suited to playing at No 12 or No 13. He started four of five Six Nations matches at inside-centre but on this evidence it seems hard to argue that he is not better suited to playing one out with that extra yard of space. Not least when he has George Ford and Owen Farrell inside him and surely this will not be the last time Jones deploys this trio in midfield from the start.Ireland were given a warning of Tuilagi’s threat and how Ford and Farrell might combine to release him early on. He could not quite wriggle free the first time but did so the second and from there England embarked on a series of phases that led to Elliot Daly’s try. Just before it, Tuilagi left a huge dent in the Ireland defence, creating the space for Daly to finish on the right. For his own score, he burst through a gap with the kind of acceleration he was showcasing eight years ago.He ended the first half with seven defenders beaten – equalling his best ever for a whole match, which was against Romania in 2011 – and after the break hit Jordan Larmour so hard that the Twickenham groundsman will be picking bits of the Ireland wing off the turf for the next few weeks.Soon after he tracked Jacob Stockdale down the left and bundled him into touch. He was also in the thick of things for Joe Cokanasiga’s second try, running a perfect decoy line after Ford and Farrell had combined. He does not even have to touch the ball to leave his imprint.Ben Youngs knows Tuilagi better than most, having come through the Leicester academy with him. On Friday he said he had never seen Tuilagi in better physical shape but perhaps more significantly, spoke of what a good place he was in mentally and perhaps the best thing that can be said about Tuilagi is that it is no longer necessary to hold one’s breath whenever he gets the ball and sets off towards a wall of defenders, as was the case not so long ago. We often hear about how popular Tuilagi is off the pitch, how he rules the pool table and makes everyone coffee and seeing him in this kind of form is sure to rub off on his team-mates. “He’s in a good place, he’s got a smile on his face, he’s getting fitter,” said Jones.“He’s about 80 per cent fit, when he gets there he will be a handful. One of his best assets is that people like to play with him.”Throughout his tenure, Jones has never liked answering questions about players absent from his squad. The mere utterance of Danny Cipriani has often been met with a quiet fury and more recently it has been Ben Te’o off limits. Over the years he has always had time to talk about Tuilagi, however. Now we know why."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar.

Tracy Ann Oberman tweeted: “Jaw drop. To the floor.”“Speculation builds about how well Olivia Colman will succeed Claire Foy as the Queen in the coming third series of The Crown,” Moore wrote on Monday, in a column that picked up traction on social media throughout the week.“Ms Colman herself has expressed anxiety on this score. There is no doubt that she is one of the best actresses of the age, but I have a doubt, too. She has a distinctly leftwing face. This is hard to describe, but easy to recognise.“It is something to do with looking slightly resentful and ironic at the idea of having to play a public role which satisfies the demands of others. The real live Queen has no such face – allowing almost no difference discernible in public between the role and the person.“I hasten to add that I have no idea what Olivia Colman’s political views are.

There was no information on her current condition.So far in 2019 a total of 16 measles cases have been reported among Los Angeles county residents, and 11 infected people are known to have traveled through the county.The disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission for at least a year. CDC officials say the US risks losing its measles elimination status if the current outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.Symptoms of the virus, which can cause severe complications and even death, include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash which can appear up to three weeks following exposure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2acc02903938e74780ad218781150fd851d5febb/0_427_5104_3065/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71231aef508c2217c094dbd9d59bd04f","title":"civilians idlib syria bashar al assad total victory","story":"Offensive in Idlib threatens entire region as Turkey fears a new influx of refugeesOne family’s endless horror in SyriaSyrian government forces have made fresh military advances towards President Bashar al-Assad’s goal of reclaiming “every inch” of the country in an offensive that has intensified fears of a humanitarian disaster in the northern Idlib province.Opposition fighters withdrew last week from the key town of Khan Sheikhoun, another strategic concession to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers, who have torn up a ceasefire deal protecting the rebels’ last major pocket of territory.As the country’s bloody civil war grinds into its ninth year, Assad is widely acknowledged to have emerged triumphant.But the fighting is far from over, with the terms of victory and the shape of Syria’s future still very much in play on the battlefield.Armed groups are dug in across much of the north, including extremist opposition fighters in Idlib, and beyond them foreign-backed fighters including Turkish proxy militias and US-backed Kurds along sections of the border with Turkey and Iraq.Caught in the middle of the fighting, as brutal as it ever has been during this conflict, are desperate civilians. Around three million are trapped in the opposition-held province of Idlib.The area is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaida affiliate that came to dominate the opposition after infighting and fragmentation destroyed more moderate groups.But the civilians gathered there come from a much broader range of backgrounds, many of them opposition supporters displaced multiple times from areas that have since fallen to Assad, including Aleppo and the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Many have fallen under HTS control without actively supporting them.The latest crisis was set in motion in April, when the Syrian government offensive shredded a truce that was agreed last year between Turkey, Iran and Russia. It had created a buffer zone between the last remaining pockets of rebel-held territory and Assad’s forces.The scale and intensity of the bombardment that followed, including attacks on health facilities and schools, led the United Nations to launch an inquiry. It will investigate government targeting of UN-backed facilities and protected civilian sites that were on a list provided to Syrian authorities.Assad claimed that his troops attacked only because Turkey did not stick to its commitments to keep extremists out of the area, which Turkey rejects.Aid agencies say civilians fleeing the military advance face desperate conditions in makeshift refugee camps without water or sanitation, and with shortages of food. With the Turkish border to the north sealed, however, they have nowhere else to go as the fighting intensifies.The Syrian authorities have opened a “humanitarian corridor” for non-combatants to leave, but it leads to government-controlled areas, and few of those trapped see it as a safe escape route. Returnees with opposition links have faced detention, conscription or worse when arriving in parts of the country ruled by Assad’s forces.Khan Sheikhoun was targeted by Assad because it gives his forces control over part of a key highway linking the central city of Homs to Syria’s battered commercial capital Aleppo, and severs an opposition supply route.But the advance into the town deepened the standoff between Turkish and Syrian forces, by cutting off Turkish troops based at one of 12 “observation points” under the ceasefire deal. Ankara said it would not move the site.“The ninth observation post remains in its place. All the other observation posts foreseen or put in place under the Idlib agreement will continue to operate where they are,” said a Turkish government spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin.The effective siege of the Turkish outpost comes days after Syrian government air strikes targeted a Turkish military convoy that Damascus claimed was trying to reinforce rebel lines, killing three civilians and injuring several others.Syria’s government has made no bones about its intentions to reunify the country, by force if necessary. The foreign minister Walid al-Moallem underlined its commitment in a meeting with the Chinese envoy to Syria, Xie Xiaoyan, in Damascus last week. The government would fight for “every inch” of Syrian territory, “in spite of the blatant Turkish intervention”, he told Xie, according to the state news agency Sana.But Turkey too is under extreme political pressure to keep Idlib free of Assad’s control, both for strategic reasons, and because of fear about the three million people clustering ever closer to its border.It already hosts more than 3.6 million refugees, who have become a political liability authorities are trying to close refugee camps and send some of them home.Turkey would struggle to deal with a fresh influx but it fears increasing pressure to open its borders if Syrian government forces close in further on civilians gathered on the other side.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will host his Russian and Iranian counterparts for a summit on Syria next month, he announced on Thursday. They will discuss Idlib, but also political efforts to end the war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/550f97b3455da9957d92ad93e936a884a871ff4c/81_254_2859_1715/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c5fc4c5f987d32ae86814cece3eb1f7","title":"far right groups infiltrated uk nuclear submarine crew","story":"Member of Identitarian Movement ‘due to start work on Navy’s nuclear Trident sub’Two members of the Royal Navy, including one who is due to start work on a Trident nuclear submarine, are members of a far-right group with links to a banned terrorist organisation, the Observer can reveal.An undercover informant, who infiltrated the UK branch of the pan-European Identitarian Movement and had access to thousands of internal messages, met a Royal Navy sailor who revealed that he was about to take up a posting on a submarine armed with Trident nuclear missiles.The meeting, involving an informant for anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, took place at the annual conference of Generation Identity UK in London on 27 July.The Identitarian Movement, which is fiercely opposed to mass migration, has expanded rapidly in the past two years and has at least 63 “regional branches” of varying sizes across Europe.The “great replacement” theory was cited as motivation by the mass shooters in the Christchurch mosque attacks, which killed 51 people in March, and the massacre in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month, in which 22 people died.There is no suggestion that GI UK endorses or supports violence.Last night the identities of the naval recruit and another GI member serving at the same base were sent to the MoD, which issued a statement saying: “Any extremist ideology is completely at odds with our values.”The infiltration, coordinated by Hope not Hate, was abruptly terminated after the group’s alleged links to Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet were discovered. “When we realised far-right activists from a group whose stated goal is the ethnic cleansing of Europe were in the navy, we decided to sound the alarm,” said the informant, who has shared the entire cache of internal messages and planning documents of the identitarian group.The messages show that Generation Identity UK was expelled by the movement’s pan-European network for inviting an antisemite to its recent conference and is now preparing to merge with far-right party For Britain, run by Anne Marie Waters. Prominent supporters of Waters include jailed anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson.The revelation that the far right has a presence in the armed forces follows the widespread outcry last year when Robinson posed for a photograph alongside a group of military figures.The informant, whose identity is being withheld by the Observer, added that the recruit he met at last month’s second-ever UK conference of Generation Identity, held in south Kensington, alleged that his membership of GI was widely known in the service. “He says the navy knows he is a member of GI. He claims all the officers are racist,” said the informant, who spent five months inside the group and officially left it as the Observer went to press.Simon Murdoch, identitarianism researcher at Hope Not Hate, said: “The idea that iniduals who subscribe to the dangerous far-right ideology that influenced the Christchurch killer are serving members of the Royal Navy, and that one claims to be taking up a job on a nuclear submarine, is completely unacceptable and actually quite terrifying. We simply cannot allow this dangerous ideology to gain any traction within our armed forces.”A YouTuber who had links to National Action before it was proscribed as a terrorist group by the Home Office in 2016, spoke at last month’s London conference, although the speech was not recorded, at the organisers’ request. The informant claimed the speaker had also invited two National Front members who were also former members of National Action and were identified by a GI regional leader.Previously, Jacob Bewick, an activist with GI, had been exposed as a member of National Action and was spotted at an NA march in 2016. At the conference, one GI UK member told the informant that two members of the fascist National Front were also believed to be former National Action recruits.While Generation Identity UK disavows violence and neo-Nazism, internal correspondence, sent on encrypted messaging app Telegram, reveals racism and antisemitism. They show that the UK branch has been expelled from Europe’s large identitarian network after recently inviting antisemitic white supremacist Colin Robertson – aka Millennial Woes – from West Lothian to its conference last month.Martin Sellner, the Austrian leader of Europe’s Generation Identity movement, wrote to fellow leaders, that he would “disavow the English movement publicly and declare that it is no longer part of GI, demanding to change its name and branding” after its unauthorised invite to “alt-right YouTubers, whose positions do not represent us”.Robertson has described himself as “pro-slavery” and called for the torpedoing of refugee boats.In June, Sellner himself was permanently excluded from entering the UK by the Home Office, which assessed that the 30-year-old posed a serious threat to the UK’s interests of preventing social harm and countering extremism.Another speaker at the conference was Waters, who has described Islam as “evil” and has attracted 34,000 Facebook followers to her group.Last night, an MoD spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment specifically on these allegations. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and would always carry out investigations into such matters when they are made against service personnel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cff81d5c74da11c2d10e6cedebdf1b8e79c1ec4/77_206_1774_1064/master/1774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3c4bcf8657c7089aa96f22ec486ba32","title":"kitchener camp sandwich kent german jews haven","story":"Descendants of the Kitchener Camp men rescued from the Nazis will unveil a plaque on war’s 80th anniversaryIt is a near-forgotten chapter in 20th-century history: the rescue of thousands of Jewish men from the Nazis, brought to a camp on the outskirts of the medieval town of Sandwich in Kent as darkness fell across Europe.The Kitchener Camp rescue began in February 1939, and by the time war broke out seven months later about 4,000 men – mainly German and Austrian Jews – had arrived by train and boat. Although the story of the 10,000 Jewish children brought to the UK on the Kindertransport is well known, the Kitchener Camp has received much less attention.On 2 September, a blue plaque will be unveiled in Sandwich in the presence of descendants of the rescued men, as well as the son and daughter of two Jewish philanthropist brothers who ran the camp.Among those present will be Paul Secher, whose father, Otto, arrived in May 1939.“My father didn’t talk about it very much,” said Secher. “I sensed it was a painful subject for him. He managed to escape but his parents and a sister didn’t. The burden must have been immense.”After the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938, when Jews and their property were violently attacked, about 30,000 Jewish men were rounded up and taken to Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps.The Central British Fund (CBF), a Jewish aid organisation in the UK now known as World Jewish Relief, persuaded the British government to admit some refugees. Adult men were brought to the UK on condition they would not be granted UK citizenship, they must not work, and they must emigrate onwards to the US, Australia and elsewhere.The CBF organised transport and rented a derelict army base at Richborough, near Sandwich, to house the men. Their first task was to transform the site into a small town. They built or refurbished 42 accommodation huts, shower and toilet blocks, two synagogues, a medical clinic, a post office and shops. A 1,000-seat cinema was constructed with money donated by Oscar Deutsch, the founder of the Odeon chain.The men were not interned they could request a pass to leave the camp. They played football against local teams, visited nearby beaches, and some illicitly worked for cash on Kent farms. Nine editions of a newsletter, the Kitchener Camp Review, were published.At the time, the population of Sandwich was 3,500. The arrival of 4,000 refugees could have been overwhelming but they were largely welcomed. Hundreds of people attended concerts performed by refugee musicians, and local children visited the camp to play table tennis.The men expected their families – parents, siblings, wives and children – to follow them to the UK. Some women were granted “domestic service visas” enabling them to escape the Nazis, but arrivals abruptly ended with the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.Nearly all Kitchener men were categorised in tribunals as “friendly aliens”, with the words “refugee from Nazi oppression” stamped on their papers. “Enemy aliens” were interned.After the start of the war, 887 Kitchener men enlisted in the Pioneer Corps. But after the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, public opinion turned against German-speaking refugees, who some suspected of being spies or saboteurs. Those not serving in the war effort were interned or deported to Australia and Canada. The Kitchener Camp was closed.An exception was Lothar Nelken, who had been a judge in Germany before being stripped of his position under the Nuremberg Laws and interned in Buchenwald concentration camp. “He wrote a diary throughout the war. I grew up knowing about his experiences in Buchenwald. He never kept secrets, he shared his memories,” said his son, Stephen.On Thursday 13 July 1939, Lothar Nelken wrote: “At around 9pm we arrived in the camp… We were welcomed with jubilation. After supper we were taken to our huts Hut 37II. I chose an upper bunk. One hut sleeps 36 men. The beds are surprisingly good. One sleeps as if in a cradle.”In 1973, Clare Ungerson discovered a plaque in Sandwich, “but the wording was very strange, referring to refugees from Nazi oppression”. The daughter of a German Jewish refugee, Ungerson “realised it must refer to Jews, but I’d never heard of this camp”.After she retired, she researched and wrote a book, Four Thousand Lives, which is being reprinted this month. In terms of the terrible history of the time, the Kitchener Camp may be a small detail she said, “but it’s not small to the many descendants of Kitchener men, who would not exist if those men hadn’t been rescued”.The exhibition, entitled Leave to Land: The Kitchener Camp Rescue 1939, will run until 8 September. Through it, said Ungerson, documents and memorabilia kept safe by families for 80 years “will now see the light of day to tell a story that for too long has been relatively unknown”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ae072931ccc45a05f26afb7ee29bb2bd234999c/61_0_677_406/master/677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b69576b3fccd9a59f8089049a710354","title":"russia today puts japan on the map where new zealand should be","story":"New channel apologises to New Zealanders for map mix-up that also labelled Papua New Guinea as South KoreaRussian news channel RT has apologised for apparently accidentally labelling New Zealand as “Japan”, and Papua New Guinea as “South Korea” in an embarrassing southern hemisphere mix-up.The mistake came in a segment produced by their US bureau about potential new missile bases in “Japan, South Korea and Australia”.

The caption makes clear that “this video includes a corrected map”.In the segment, titled “Manoeuvring missiles”, correspondent Ashlee Banks explained how the US was looking at potential missile bases in Asia.“Another fight between the US and China is heating up, this time it’s over missiles,” she said. “The US has officially withdrawn from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty and now plans to place weapons across the Asia Pacific.“The US is looking to place missiles in Japan, South Korea and Australia,” she said, even as the graphic showed something else.New Zealand, a country of 4.7 million people, is so often forgotten on maps that Tourism New Zealand launched an entire campaign based on the phenomenon.With Ardern and comedian Rhys Darby, it described it as “the next great conspiracy: New Zealand is disappearing off world maps”.A Reddit thread dedicated to recording incidents where New Zealand is left off global maps has more than 74,000 subscribers – among them the infamous map of the world made entirely out of chicken nuggets, but without New Zealand."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3995625.1566590514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland must open up to plan b to backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder fears: “It would be a lot better to have an actual proper conversation now rather than wait until the 11th hour when we are in the worst possible situation.”  Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Government needs to open up and discuss a plan B to the Brexit backstop, according to the chair of the technical group behind proposed alternative arrangements embraced by new British prime minister Boris Johnson. Shanker Singham, an adviser on trade who chairs the technical panel of the non-governmental Alternative Arrangements Commission, said he did not think it “wise” for Dublin not to discuss a possible no-deal exit with London given the heightened risk that this scenario could happen by the next Brexit deadline of October 31st. He said that it was essential for the Irish, British and French customs authorities to have “critical conversations” to avoid the disruption of a no-deal “that are not happening now.” Tánaiste Simon Coveney this week ruled out direct discussions with the UK around preparing for a no-deal. “The best approach from the Irish Government would be to open up and at least have a discussion about these things,” Mr Singham told The , referring to the alternative to the backstop his group had proposed, which includes a proposal to create a new common food safety zone covering Ireland and the UK.‘Proper conversation’“We may be at a point late in October where we have to have discussions. It would be a lot better to have an actual proper conversation now rather than wait until the 11th hour when we are in the worst possible situation.”In meetings with the French and German leaders this week, Mr Johnson referred to the alternative arrangements proposed last month by the group led by former Conservative minister Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, now UK culture secretary, that would avoid the UK entering the backstop.The backstop is the insurance plan within the proposed withdrawal agreement covering the UK’s exit from the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the absence of another solution being found in future. The House of Commons has rejected the withdrawal agreement three times amid fears the backstop could tie the UK to EU economic rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson has demanded that the backstop be scrapped. Backstop supersededTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he would listen to Mr Johnson’s alternative proposals and if he can convince the EU and Ireland, which has ruled out reopening the Brexit agreement, that they could supersede the backstop. Mr Singham said his group had been in discussions with Downing Street about its alternative arrangements.The commission would be publishing suggested changes to the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, the non-binding road map setting out a future EU-UK trade deal, “in the course of the next week or so” that would add more detail to its proposed arrangements around the alternative to the backstop, he said.Mr Singham said he could “sympathise” with Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney if the choice around the UK’s exit was either the alternative arrangements or the backstop, but he added that “the game has changed completely in Westminster” with the election of Mr Johnson as prime minister. “We are now in a world where the choice is alternative arrangements versus no-deal, not alternative arrangements versus backstop. In that world I think you would want to be talking,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

It also suggests that search could be more likely to find life on exoplanets than we had thought.This is a surprising conclusion, said lead researcher Dr Stephanie Olson.\u0026nbspIt shows us that conditions on some exoplanets with favourable ocean circulation patterns could be better suited to support life that is more abundant or more active than life on Earth.In recent years, scientists have found huge numbers of exoplanets, or worlds orbiting around stars that are not our own. But they are all very far away – impossible to reach even with the fastest space probes, and difficult even to see in any detail.Researchers are working on a variety of ways to learn about those worlds, including telescopes that will be able to sniff their atmospheres and learn more about what the planets could be made of. But to understand the information that comes back, scientists need to build detailed and complicated models of how planets form and their climates work.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

The work was presented at the\u0026nbspGoldschmidt\u0026nbspGeochemistry\u0026nbspCongress in\u0026nbspBarcelona.Nasa watching planet for signs of alien life after discoveryNASA\u0027s search for life in the Universe is focused on so-called Habitable Zone planets, which are worlds that have the potential for liquid water oceans, she said.\u0026nbspBut not all oceans are equally hospitable – and some oceans will be better places to live than others due to their global circulation patterns.To conduct the study, the team made models of those planets using Nasa software, which allows them to simulate the conditions on those exoplanets. Using that Nasa technology, they were able to create models of the possible climates and oceans that could be on those exoplanets.They found that many of them seemed like more hospitable and flourishing places for life than even Earth is. They looked at the process in Earth\u0027s oceans that allows life to take root down here – and considered whether that same process could be happening elsewhere in the universe.Our work has been aimed at identifying the exoplanet oceans which have the greatest capacity to host globally abundant and active life, said Dr Olson in a statement.Life in Earth\u0027s oceans depends on upwelling (upward flow) which returns nutrients from the dark depths of the ocean to the sunlit portions of the ocean where photosynthetic life lives. More upwelling means more nutrient resupply, which means more biological activity.These are the conditions we need to look for on exoplanets.By modelling a variety of different exoplanets, the researchers were able to think about which types would be most likely to develop and then sustain life. And they were surprised to find that Earth is not the best kind – and that there may be other worlds out there that are a far better place for life to begin.We have used an ocean circulation model to identify which planets will have the most efficient upwelling and thus offer particularly hospitable oceans, she said.\u0026nbspWe found that higher atmospheric density, slower rotation rates, and the presence of continents all yield higher upwelling rates.A further implication is that Earth might not be optimally habitable – and life elsewhere may enjoy a planet that is even more hospitable than our own.The work is important because our technology means that we are unable to see everything: there is almost certainly more life than we will ever be able to see, even with the most advanced telescopes and other equipment. That means scientists will need to optimise their search by looking at the planets where life will find it easiest to find a home.We expect oceans to be important in regulating some of the most compelling remotely detectable signs of life on habitable worlds, but our understanding of oceans beyond our solar system is currently very rudimentary, said\u0026nbspChris\u0026nbspReinhard, from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who wasn\u0027t involved in the study.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspOlson\u0027s work represents a significant and exciting step forward in our understanding of exoplanet oceanography.The new research could now help inform how new telescopes are built, since we now know what kinds of planets will be best to search for. Now we know what to look for, so we need to start looking, said Dr Olson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened.

On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The first of a number of future Star Wars TV series on Disney+,\u0026nbspThe Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as a lone bounty hunter roaming the wasteland left behind after the downfall of the Empire at the end of Return of the Jedi.Pascal is surrounded by an eclectic cast that includes Carl Weathers, Giancarlo Esposito, Gina Carano, Nick Nolte and the literal Werner Herzog, who is reliably snarling and menacing in the trailer.Following years of speculation, Ewan McGregor is indeed returning to the Star Wars universe and reprising his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi. According to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, the scripts for the series have already been written, with production due to begin in 2020.It was previously reported that the character, played by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy, would be getting his own film, but following the disappointing box office performance of the Han Solo spin-off movie Solo: A Star Wars Story, the studio has decided to proceed with the project on the small screen.Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon KnightWhile we know little about any of these projects\u0026nbspother than the fact that they’re in development, TV series based on comic book characters Ms Marvel, She-Hulk and Moon Knight are in the pipeline. In her current incarnation, Ms Marvel is the first Muslim superhero to headline her own Marvel comic book. Moon Knight is a former US marine who transforms into a costumed vigilante at night, while She-Hulk is historically the cousin of male-Hulk Dr Bruce Banner.According to the Hollywood Reporter, British writer and comedian Bisha K Ali will write the Ms Marvel series.After appearing on stage to perform a rendition of “We’re All In This Together” from the original High School Musical, the cast of the TV series adaptation introduced the show’s first trailer. The new High School Musical is in truth a mockumentary (which explains the convoluted title) that follows a group of high school students auditioning for their school play… which is High School Musical itself.Lady and the TrampThe first trailer for Disney’s live-action remake of the animated classic was also released. The new film finds Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux voicing the dogs of the title, with real-life rescue dogs supplying their form (though with some CGI assistance to make their mouths move). Kiersey Clemons and Thomas Mann are Lady’s live-action owners, while Janelle Monae, Sam Elliott and Ken Jeong are among the supporting voiceover cast.Disney+ launches on 12 November in the US, Canada,\u0026nbspAustralia and the Netherlands, but a UK launch date remains unannounced so far.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening.

The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Terri Minsky, who created the original show, will be the showrunner on the series, which is expected to debut in 2020 on the forthcoming Disney streaming service Disney+.Writing on Instagram, Duff said that she had “been trying to contain this excitement for a loooong time while this has been in the works!” adding: “I am beyond excited to be home again, back with my girl and into her 30’s.” She also hashtagged the message with “#bringbackbutterflyclips”.Everything we know about Disney+Hilary Duff opens up about breastfeeding as a working motherLizzie McGuire ran from 2001 until 2004 on the Disney Channel, with Duff playing a teenage girl muddling through high school and striving for popularity.The show was turned into a film, The Lizzie McGuire Movie, in 2004, before Duff embarked on an acting and musical career outside of Disney.

On Friday, the website still showed the remaining property – a five-bedroom house – as available for sale at a price of £875,000.One HAB investor, who put in several thousand pounds, was quoted as saying: “I’m disappointed that what I saw as an idealistic project seems to be collapsing on a sour note, with the original directors having departed and investors seemingly left to bear the entire financial burden of a failed enterprise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Here’s everything that happened at Disney’s D23 expoStan Lee’s daughter hits out at Marvel over Spider-Man splitThousands of Spider-Man fans pledge to ‘storm’ Sony over Disney feudMarvel fans more familiar with She-Hulk’s history, meanwhile, have rolled their eyes at the outrage and celebrated the TV arrival of a much-loved comics character. “The amount of ignorance in these comments, man,” wrote one Instagram user.

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting. These jellies are incredibly rare and this new South African species is no exception.Palestinian men breathe fire on the beach as entertainment for children during the summer vacation in Gaza City.A woman rows a boat through the lotus plants on the waters of Dal Lake in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir.

guarantees from Boris Johnson that he will not sign a post-Brexit trade deal with Brazil if it fuels the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.In a warning to the prime minister to be wary of a deal with far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who has been accused of encouraging loggers and ranchers to clear the forest, shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner said: “We cannot risk our planet to buy cheap beef.”Mr Johnson has refused to join French president Emmanuel Macron and Irish premier Leo Varadkar in threatening to block a South American trade deal if Mr Bolsonaro fails to live up to his commitments to protect the environment.Stressing his unwillingness to disrupt trade at a time when fears of a global showdown are rising, the PM said that some leaders at the G7 Summit in Biarritz were using the catastrophic wildfires in the Amazon as an “excuse” to interfere with free trade.But Mr Gardiner warned that a deal with Mr Bolsonaro might mean UK consumers eating beef from cows reared in the very areas currently being cleared of their ancient forest by fire.Created with Sketch.Amazon rainforest swept by fires: In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with

sink for the world’s carbon emissions and its destruction has a major impact on the global effort to tackle climate change. In addition the Amazon is home to an estimated 10 per cent of the world’s species.Mr Gardiner said: “While the Amazon rainforest burns to clear space for cattle and crops, the Conservative government is cosying up to Brazil’s far-right president Bolsonaro.“Any post-Brexit trade deal with Brazil must guarantee that the UK is not further contributing to the destruction of the Amazon. We cannot risk our planet to buy cheap beef.“The Amazon is our planet’s great shield against climate change and we are wilfully destroying it. The homes of indigenous people and millions of plant and animal species are under threat.“Boris Johnson’s vision for Britain after No Deal Brexit seems to be that we sell off the NHS to Trump’s America, trash the Amazon with a deal with Mr Bolsonaro and fuel war by selling arms to the Saudi dictatorship.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the UK over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea is hard to avoid for farmers such as Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Sheets says, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Sheets acknowledges\u0026nbspthat he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-08.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), says there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she says. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, says\u0026nbspDonald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he adds\u0026nbsphe hopes\u0026nbspit would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world. I’ve travelled all over the world representing the pork industry.“In the end, I don’t care what culture you go to or you get embedded in, they all just want to feed their families and support their families and have the government leave them alone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The two men were seen walking together a year after Epstein had been convicted.There are allegations — strongly denied by Buckingham Palace — that Andrew was more directly involved in Epstein’s sordid shenanigans.most read in opinion\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-IRA.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentLEO MCKINSTRY The Troubles could come back with a vengeance as New IRA rears its ugly head \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Brendan-ONeill.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentBRENDAN ONEILL Why so glum for those on Planet Remain  Were loving it on Planet Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Daniel-Hannan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentDANIEL HANNAN Dishonest Brussels stand-off with Boris Johnson is bordering on absurd \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS EU leaders know No Deal is bad for them, it would be mad not to mitigate risks \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Be the Duchess of Woke or jet-setter, Meghan, but you cant be both What cannot be denied is Andrew’s close friendship with the vile but powerful man.Remaining Epstein’s bosom buddy after he had been convicted certainly shows bad judgment.But then parts of Andy’s career as a royal have involved bad judgment.He apparently enjoys the retinue of rich and famous tossers who gather around him, no doubt anxious to be associated with the British crown.And he doesn’t seem to care very much how awful some of them are.This is shaping up to be a bad year for the Royal Family.Prince Andrew, never hugely adored by the public, could be a source of grave embarrassment to them.The public is also tiring of Harry and Meghan’s relentless political preaching, whining and hypocrisy. The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant. She went for the maximum allowed in the UK – ml.As you can imagine, they look pretty ridiculous. She has a way to go, though, to beat doolally German model Martina Big whose baps check in at  litres.And indeed Lacey Wildd, whose  breasts weigh more than lbs each and actually glow in the dark.Maybe Aisleyne could next buy some jubblies that do magic tricks or something.IT’S not often this column comes to the defence of Gary Lineker.Truth be told, I’m a little bit weary of the jug-eared, virtue-signalling, overpaid, crisp-flogging dimbo.But he’s in trouble for having made a joke – not a funny joke, obvs – about his co-presenters being bald. That’s Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy.Cue outrage from the follically challenged members of the public.It is now almost impossible to make a joke about anything without someone wetting the bed and writing a letter of ­complaint.How did we get so thin-skinned in this country Lower the tone  Always happy to oblige.Stop bullying people, you third world dog-munching commies.THE Queen’s pharmacist, Ainsworths, is selling homeopathic remedies.These are remedies which do not work.Homeopathy is a charlatan movement in denial of science.One of the remedies sold is “Berlin Wall”. This claims to have the spirit of the Berlin Wall in it.And the homeopaths suggest it might be good for healing relationships.I used to think homeopathy should be banned outright.But now I think – hell,you’re dumb enough to believe that rubbish, good luck to you.BORIS Johnson is stamping around Europe demanding the EU scrap the ridiculous Northern Ireland backstop.He’s absolutely right to do so.If only this had been done three years ago, we’d have a decent deal and be free of the EU by now.But time is short. And the EU knows that Boris still doesn’t have a majority in parliament to push No Deal through, no matter what he says.So they will be less likely to agree to concessions.It just makes you weep at three wasted years.When we were led by a Prime Minister who didn’t think we SHOULD leave the EU.And caved in on every issue.Just two thirds  What kind of drugs are the other third on  Horse tranquillisers and crack Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t make a very good caretaker of a carpet warehouse, never mind PM.THEY’RE trying to improve the look of Sunderland. No easy task, you might think.And so the city’s Business Improvement District has put out a notice politely asking residents to stop pooing in the streets.Apparently it’s all the rage up there.The BID people said: “Disappointingly we’ve seen an increase in people thinking it is absolutely acceptable to defecate or urinate in public in our city centre. This will not be tolerated.”I think they’re being a bit heavy-handed. Maybe as a compromise measure they should just hand out little black poo bags to everybody.Then the locals can go about their business in front of, say, Greggs, and scoop it up immediately and put it in a bin.You Mackems, huh.

And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.From their increasingly isolated planet, the chattering classes rage against No Deal, denounce Boris as “far Right”, and bad-mouth Britain.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet.

Those most in danger are the elderly, people with underlying health conditions and babies and very young children.The level three heatwave  warning is in place for the East of England, where temperatures will likely hit -C between Saturday and Monday amid a number of big events, including Ed Sheeranaposs homecoming gigs in Ipswich, Suffolk.  The rest of England is under level twoor level one status, while no critical weather warnings have been issued for Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales.And with the temperatures reaching record breaking levels this weekend people will be finding it hard to sleep in the heatwave. However, one expert has come up with an unexpected tip to help people nod off when temperatures are soaring. Believe it or not, a hot water bottle could be just the thing you need to kelp you get a good nightaposs sleep. Expert James Wilson, AKA The Sleep Geek,explained: It can take us a bit of time to get used to the warmer weather at bedtime, particularlywe are staying in a place that doesn’t have air conditioning.    It is important that we feel cooler before bed as one of the important parts of the process our body’s go through to sleep is a drop in core temperature. If we are struggling to sleep because of the heat a great tip is to trick your body into thinking its core temperature has dropped. To do this you can either have  a lukewarm shower or alternatively, and this is a particular favourite of mine, fill a hot water bottle with lukewarm water and place your feet on it about half an hour before bed. The lukewarm water raises our core temperature slightly and our body reacts to it by trying to shed the excess heart, which means we then get a drop in core temperature and voila. We have created the right conditions core temperature wise for us to get better sleep.    The change in weather comes after weeks of unseasonable and unsettled weather which led to heavy rain and flooding in parts of the country. The Met Office said: There is a  per cent probability of heat health criteria being met between am on Saturday and am on Monday in parts of England.  High pressure will build across England, bringing very warm or hot conditions to many parts of the country during Saturday and Sunday.  Highest temperatures look to be across the eastern England, with western parts turning less hot Sunday.  "},{"url":null,"title":"flybe flew empty plane 123","story":"NewsEmpty plane flew  miles to pick up Prince William and Kate MiddletonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were not being as environmentally conscious as they thought after an empty plane was redirected especially for them, it is claimedShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsWilliam carried the bags with the kids in tow \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Following on from the criticism surrounding Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs four private jet jaunts in  days, Prince William and Kate Middleton were praised for grabbing the green initiative. Earlier this week a video of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge along with their children boarding a commercial airline to Scotland emerged. The £ a head flight would do signicantly less environmental damage per passenger than a specially chartered private plane. Kate and William were being less green than they thought however.    Unbeknownst to the royals, an Embraer  jet was ordered from Eastern Airwaysaposs Humberside HQ to Norwich, where the royals were flying from, according to the Daily Mail. Kate, Will and their kids then got on this plane rather than the smaller Loganair plane initially intended to make the trip. Flight logs show that the plane flew  miles down to Norfolk early on Thursday morning, with its identication number EZEP reportedly indicating it was empty. The Cambridges slipped onto the plane at the last minute, rather than the smaller Logan Air aircraft earmarked to make the flight up to Aberdeen.    The .am flight is normally operated by Loganair on behalf of Eastern Airways, which is Flybeaposs franchise partner. The two empty flights would be responsible for an extra . tonnes of carbon emissions - just shy of half of one British personaposs annual carbon footprint. A spokesperson for Flybe said: Flybe denies any involvement in the decision over which aircraft to fly on this route, which is fully operated by Eastern Airways. On Saturday morning an Eastern Airways spokesperson said the company took full responsibility for the additional flight. They said: “Eastern Airways can confirm any decision as to which aircraft operated the Norwich-Aberdeen service on Thursday morning was entirely that of Eastern Airways and not that of Flybe as reported.

Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror    “He’d always been fine with the girls. I had no reason to believe that he was capable of doing something like that. “He’d been horrible to me in the past but not against my kids, never.” Tracey, of Walsall, West Midlands, also revealed that Billingham has refused to give up his parental rights to their two surviving girls – even though he is now serving le in jail. He is entitled to regular updates on the other kids and has a say in medical treatment and education. Tracey even needs permission to take them on holiday. He can also bar the girls from changing their surname. Tracey said: “How can the man who murdered my daughter have control over my children  Why should he know about their welfare  He lost all rights when he killed Mylee. “He doesn’t want me to be able to move on and, by having control of the kids, he has control of me. One of my daughters was called a ‘murderer in the making’ because of her surname.” WHAT WE ARE CALLING FOR . A change in the law, which means anyone who has been convicted of violent crime, child abuse or sexual offences can’t have automatic, unsupervised access to their kids. The same rules would apply to those who’d had similar findings made against them in the civil courts. The ban could only be overturned by a judgethe parent had undergone a thorough assessment by an independent expert proving they have been rehabilitated. . Mandatory, standardised training in domestic abuse for judges, social workers and any other professionals involved in child access arrangements. We also want to see domestic abuse training for coroners overseeing domestic homicide inquests. . More State funding to support the hundreds of thousands of children in the UK affected by domestic abuse – including the , kids currently being supported by Refuge. It is only with the right support, such as specialist therapy, that these children can recover from the trauma they have experienced.   Tracey’s world imploded when Mylee was killed on an access visit in January . Billingham was furious because Tracey was in a new relationship, even though they had split up years earlier. Authorities had not checked Mylee was safe with her father even though he had a s conviction for ABH relating to a previous girlfriend, of which Tracey was unaware. His murder trial at Birmingham Crown Court also heard claims he had threatened to jump from a balcony while holding his son from a past relationship. Tracey said thatshe had known about his background she would have taken legal action, even though it might not have succeeded. Our nine-month probe has shown that even when cases reach the family courts, judges often grant unsupervised access to violent criminal parents. The Children Act, introduced in , was designed to ensure the welfare of children comes first. But it does not specically ban anyone convicted of violent crimes, sexual offences or child abuse from unsupervised access.  Tracey said social services did visit her after Billingham was cautioned for assaulting her when Mylee was small. But she claimed they did not make clear how violent he’d been in the past, or how his behaviour put her kids at risk She said: “Nothing was really explained. I wasn’t aware of anything but my own situation.” A serious case review was commissioned in the wake of Mylee’s death, which found authorities failed to record key details about Billingham’s abuse. It also found that professionals failed to make checks to ensure Tracey and her kids were safe. Tracey is now tortured by the thought that her evil ex could have killed all three of their girls. Tracey, who has started her own petition for Myleeaposs Law to remove parental rights from people convicted of serious crimes, said: “He killed Mylee to spite me. That makes me, as Mylee’s mummy, quite grateful to Mylee because in a way, it’s like she died so her sisters didn’t have too. I do believe, as hard as it is for me to admit,it wasn’t Mylee, it would have been all three. If I could change it, I would make it me. I would switch my le for hers. You can sign the petition for Myleeaposs Law here. Our campaign is being backed by a raft of charities and MPs. Shadow home office minister Carolyn Harris said: “The idea children need both parents is admirable but a dangerous parent is a threat.” Refuge chief Sandra Horley said: “We want an end to the presumption that parental contact is always positive.”  Tracey carries on for the sake of her surviving children and is incredibly calm when she speaks about the terrible events of January . “It’s a coping mechanism. I don’t want to get up in the morning. I have too. I don’t have a choice because I’m their mum and I’ve got too look after them, she said. I want to look after them. I don’t want other people to look after them because I’m not in the right frame of mind. In the beginning, that was very dficult. I had a lot of family around me helping me to look after the girls. “I haven’t grieved properly. People say ‘oh this far down the line, you moving on ’ No, I can never move on.   Some days everything is fine. Then I remember Mylee is not there. It’s the little things, like when I buy a pack of three chocolates and have one left and I shouldnapost have and now I can’t help but keep buying that pack of three chocolates. Things like that. I’ve always shouted their names in order and itaposs always on the tip of my tongue to say Myleeaposs name.  Traceyaposs eldest daughter has launched a bid to change her surname because of the cruel aposmurderer in the makingapos taunts. “I just want my kids to grow up and be okay and not carry that stigma of that name because for them, it’s not fair, said Tracey. “My eldest has got her own opinions, she wants to change her name. She knows what happened to her sister. “My daughter is nearly . She has her own mind to think what she would like. Why should she have to carry a name that she doesn’t want ” Tracey refuses to speak negatively about Billingham in front of her children - and has banned others from speaking out. She said: “I’ve never slagged him off in front of her. I don’t think itaposs right. I’m their mum, not their enemy. I don’t want to put thoughts in their head. “My youngest daughter is autistic so doesn’t understand a great deal. But my eldest daughter who is really bright, a clever girl, knows. But no, I’ve not let anyone  say anything.  “Bad words are not said against him. In fact I don’t give him my thoughts because he’s not worth it in that sense. “I don’t talk about him. “That uses my energy and itaposs bad energy. I don’t like it.  “It doesn’t mean I condone what he did. “I hate him for it. But I’m not going to waste my good energy. And Mylee was a good child. “She gave everyone a fair chance and I don’t believe in using my children as a weapon like he did. “So to speak badly of him to my children would make me a terrible person.. That would be me using them as a weapon and that is not who I am. I would never do that. Billingham was sentenced to le with a minimum term of  years at Birmingham Crown Court in October last year. Tracey was forced to recount every minute of the horric incident in court - as the sick dad refused to show remorse and claimed he could not remember the killing. She said:  “It was traumatic to give evidence. I had to do it and I would do the same thing tomorrowit meant he was found guilty. Of course. I looked at it like I was doing my bit for Mylee. “But I had to go to court to give evidence, yet he didn’t have to get on the stand and be cross-examined. That in itself is disgusting to me. “That I had to stand and go through it all again, and tell the story that was in my head constantly anyway. I had to relive it and say it out loud to a jury and people that I didn’t know. And then he gets to say ‘no, I don’t want to get in the box’.  Part of me was like ‘well we know why, because you haven’t got an answer.’ Because you know you’ve done it, even though he said he had memory loss. He knew he did it and there was nothing. Because he said I’ve got memory loss and I can’t remember. He never suffered from memory loss before.  “It was another form of control. People have said to me, aposoh he got le, with a minimum of  yearsapos. Le should mean le actually. And it can’t bring her back. It doesn’t seem long enough. She’d be my age. Mylee would be my agehe’s released then.” Tracey says she doesn’t like to think about the way Mylee died and instead focuses on her wonderful le. She said: “Mylee was perfect. She loved dancing and singing. She would do an after school club every night and then go straight to a dance club. She was really outgoing. She loved scooters, bikes, football. “Mylee was... you know, she’d go out in a tutu with football boots. That was Mylee. “She never cried. She was never upset. She was always smiling. “She never took a side and was popular at school. That’s the type of child Mylee was. “She loved dancing, ballet, ballroom, tap. My laminate floor took the brunt of that with the tap shoes! “She could be mischievous. ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me!’, well it was! “Mylee was very close to her siblings and we celebrate her le by doing lots of things that she would have done. “At Mylee’s school, they’re doing a Mylee garden. As a positive space, not a negative.

The Queen and Prince Philip have been staying at the castle for a few weeks with a rotating cast of the Windsor clan joining them in turn.Scandal hit Prince Andrew has been and gone and this weekend the Cambridges arrived in force to enjoy the wild beauty of the sprawling estate. The family lunched together on Friday. Kate and William were seen clambering in and out of a Range Rover while the Queen drove herself, dressed in classic tartan skirt, woolen jumper and a dark green sleeveless coat.  Mum-of-three Kate was casual in jumper and slacks and carried a rucksack. She looked casual and very relaxed in a setting sure to suit her love of the outdoors. Prince Philip was also seen out and about in the grounds of the castle with his daughter Princess Anne. The Duke of Edinburgh is rarely seen in public ever since his retirement. Peter and Autumn Philips, the latter of whom is the oldest grandchild of the Queen, were also pictured at the estate. The Royals have endured a tough week as questions continue to be asked about Prince Andrewaposs friendship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement today the Duke of York said he never saw or suspected any sex crimes during the time he spent with Epstein.  But the denial hasnapost stopped serious questions being raised about his knowledge of Epsteinaposs crimes. Andrew has repeatedly denied any knowledge of Epsteinaposs alleged behaviour, but questions over his wisdom in continuing the friendship have refused to go away. The Duke was not seen in Scotland today, and was last spotted with his bodyguard at the Real Club Valderrama, one of the most exclusive courses in Europe, in southern Spain.  And another headache is the continued criticism of Prince Harry and we Meghan Markle who used a private jet four times in  days while travelling on holiday to Ibiza and the south of France. Both have previously been outspoken in their concerns about climate change. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expected to join the Royals in Balmoral shortly, though it is not thought they have arrived yet, the Daily Mail reported on Friday.

Jenner Carroll from Dublin has gained fame online for her remarkable weight loss transformation, sharing inspirational posts on her Instagram account, @jens_journey_ie with over , followers. Jenneraposs weight began to spiral when she moved to London to study where she struggled with personal issues, she told RSVP Live . The mother-of-one gained kg as a result - but has since vowed to make a change. She said: I was at a very very low place in my le and was really struggling with everything. When her son was two, Jenner decided enough was enough and took the first steps towards her new le, all to be the best mother she could be. Carter was a typical two-year-old boy. There was no way Iaposd have been able to keep up with him the way Iaposm going. I didnapost want my weight to hold him back, or hold me back from doing stuff with him. If I kept going the way I was going there was no way Iaposd be here with him in  years. Diet and Exercise    After a friend recommended slimming world to her, the mum followed its plan and lost an incredible amount of weight. Jen also explained how the meal plan was really easy to follow mainly because of their food allowances . She did not need to cut out sweets and treats completely, instead opting to eat them in moderation. She did all this on her own from home because the was to self-conscious of her weight to join a group. I didnapost want to go to a group because I was so embarrassed at the time, I bought my own food diary and religiously planned my meals for six weeks. For the first - months I used all of my syns. I lost ten stone in a year! The Slimming World plan worked well for her for a year until she decided she still wasnapost eating as healthy as she could have been. She was still snacking on goodies between meals and syning them. So she decided to join a gym and paid for personal training sessions who changed her mindset to calorie counting. He said I just had to educate myself on food. At the end of the day calories are calories no matter what diet you are following.    The inspirational woman spoke about how she found it dficult to both take her trainers advice, and follow the slimming world. While her gym work concentrated on protein intake, Slimming World focused on foods that pass through your body quickly. When she decided she couldnapost juggle both, Jen left her group and focused on her calories on the My Fitness Pal app. He always remided me that this form of weight loss would be a longer process, so in ten months I think I only lost two stone. So it was definitely a lot slower, but my body-fat was dropping a lot, and my muscle mass was increasing. So he encouraged me to focus on that rather than my weight on the scales. I was happier to do it in a healthier way. The business banker now attends the gym  mornings a week at am before four-year-old Carter wakes up. She now looks back on the times. Surgery  While dieting, Jen knew that excess skin was going to be a problem, and that surgery to remove it was always going to be on the cards for her. The thoughts of posting such a personal pictures of herself on her Instagram was very daunting. Up until this, Jen had only shared meal ideas, and had very few pictures of herself on her page. She also refrained from putting her actual weight up for everyone to see. However she also felt like it was necessary for people to see her journey and what can be achieved even in Ireland when the surgery is not commonly heard of. However when the young mum did share it, she got an amazing response from her followers. I had people messaging me saying that they lost weight maybe ten years ago and didnapost know surgery was available in Ireland because itaposs not really talked about. The response was amazing which made it all worth while for me. I wanted to show everyone that there are struggles even after you lose weight. I was really struggling because my new body was very abnormal looking. It was almost harder to look at myself. My stomach was deformed looking. It was a little bit scary. Being a parent, any kind of surgery like that is dreaded. I never had surgery before that either, but at the same time I was living with the excess skin for about a year. It was quite painful to have, especially when working out. It was seven pounds of excess skin. Recovery was  weeks, but in total it could be up to three months. I had drains in me for  weeks which was tough because I couldnapost leave the house. I thought I was going to be in agony, but recovery wasnapost too bad. Having a four-year-old was a bit dficult but my Mam and Dad really helped with that.

Following news of the private jet jaunts to Ibiza and Elton Johnaposs home in the South of France, Harry and Meghan have kept silent, but a posse of high-profile celebrities have taken to social media to defend the couple.The royal expert also thinks there is a dference in the way Harry, , is acting towards his brother Prince William,  amid rumours there is a rt between the brotheraposs families. These concerns were sparked after the announcement Meghan, , and Harry were to split households with William and Kate, .    Penny thinks it would be nothing short of a tragedythe bond between aposDianaaposs boysapos was to fall apart permanently — and it would be something the public would hate to see. Miss Junor also believes that Harry, Meghan and other Royals need to follow the example of the Queen and that of her parents, because they are fueling those who want to see the abolition of the monarchy. She highlighted the fact that during WW when bombs were falling on London, the King and Queen were advised that it was not safe for them to remain in the capital — but stayed anyway. Miss Junor said the civilians appreciated that loyalty.After Meghan and Harry were criticised for their private jet use Royal sources reportedly told Vanity Fair that the   Duchess of Sussex  is aposnot wasting timeapos on the public row over her private jet use."},{"url":null,"title":"tormented mum blames social media","story":"NewsMums torment over suicide of her Snapchat addict daughter, EXCLUSIVE: Julie Seal thinks that social media was to blame for the tragic death of her teenage daughter in .ShareCommentsByAmy SharpeOlivia Loveridge-Green:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsRuby Seal spent up to eight hours a night on social media sites after she got home from school \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Ruby Seal used the site to send anguished messages to friends saying: “I might as well kill myself in the morning.” Then she committed ­suicide when no one replied. She was found dead by her twin sisters during school half term. Last night devastated mum Julie, , told the Sunday People: “Social media was like a drug to Ruby – she was addicted. “The more obsessed she became the less she engaged with real le.    “She became withdrawn and ­isolated on it – always in her room, looking for likes, ­responses and answers to her problems on her phone from people who could not give them. “It was a place for her to hide from reality while also seeking validation from her peers. “It overrode everything  at a time when she also became ­mentally really unwell. “I tried everything – turning off the wi-fi, confiscating her phone, going through her messages – but she always found a way to access it. “Social media contributed to her death.” Ruby enjoyed skateboarding and Doctor Who before becoming ­obsessed with Snapchat at .

Longer streaks are ­rewarded with special emojis but the tally goes back to zeroa day of messaging is missed. Julie, of Carlisle, Cumbria, is now calling for Ruby’s Law – a ban on ­social media sites for under-s. She said: “I’d like to see the Government and social media s take ­responsibility so we never see another child lose their le due to the virtual world before they’ve lived a le in a real world.” Since Ruby’s death in February , Julie has been piecing together her daughter’s online le by speaking to her friends.  She was horried to realise her daughter posted a string of disturbing messages in the lead-up to her death. On the night before she died, Julie quizzed her daughter about a £ phone bill for mobile data. Ruby sent two messages to friends in Newcastle saying: “I think I might as well kill myself in the morning.” Neither replied, though it is ­unclearanyone saw the messages. Next day she killed herself. A string of teenage suicides have been linked to social media including Molly Russell, , who took her le after viewing self-harm content on Instagram. Jessica Scatterson, , killed herself in Warrington in April  after being emotionally overwhelmed by social media without the skills to cope.  Single mum Julie, who also has twins Kitty and Florry, , and Maisy, , added: “Enough is enough. This stuff is accessible to kids all the time. They are tied into it because everyone  is doing it. They don’t want to be left out. “Ruby would show me a photo of someone, going ‘Why don’t I look like that’ and wishing she didn’t wear glasses. “I told her not everything is like you see on there but she didn’t get it. “She got upset when a photo didn’t get as many likes and asked whether it was because of the way she’d done her ­eyebrows or how she was smiling. She came to my room crying, her bicep ­bleeding. She showed me her arms ­covered in marks, telling me she didn’t feel worthy of love. I felt awful.”  Ruby was referred to Child  Adult Mental Health Services for treatment and began regular counselling. She was signed off in July  and the family moved from Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle for a fresh start. But her addiction to social media was fuelled as she tried to stay in touch with her old friends. Her messages included: “I might pop down to AE and seethey can stitch my le back together.” Another said: “How I sleep at night knowing I’m a disappointment and ­knowing no one cares about me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"womans home raided after potential","story":"NewsWomans home raided after potential buyer spots her illegal collection on ZooplaSusan Tate, , put her house up for sale on Zoopla and one photograph featured a small toy in the shape of a howling wolf, perched on the top of a cabinet in her living roomShareCommentsByJack Longstaff:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsSusan Tate said she was blindly oblivious her hobby was breaking the law \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Susan Tate, , was selling up and one photograph on the home buying website featured a small toy in the shape of a howling wolf, perched on the top of a cabinet in her living room. The seemingly innocent collectible triggered a police raid with officers turning up accompanied by a Crimewatch TV crew. When they realised the fake wolf was a toy they searched the rest of the home and discovered Susanaposs taxidermy collection, including  stuffed animals and bones. Most were perfectly legal but a few items landed Susan in trouble, including a porpoise skull she found on a beach ten years ago. Police also questioned a stuffed Scottish wild cat she inherited from her mother, a blue butterfly bought online and a red squirrel purchased via Ebay for £ years ago.    Retired biology teacher Susan said she had no idea the items were illegal and had no choice but to plead guilty, accepting a £ fine plus £ in costs. Dog sitter Susan, whose parents were police officers, said she had no idea she needed a licence for her collection and has slammed the force for its heavy-handed raid. She said: The police said they received information from someone about the wolf online and checkedI had a certicate to own a stuffed wolf, and obviously I donapost. Itaposs ridiculous thataposs how the got a warrant. It was just a toy. Without the photos online all this would never have happened. The whole thing has done me a lot of harm. How the police handled it was appalling and I was devastated by it. I thought they were going to send me to jail and I was absolutely terried, said Susan. My husband said thereaposs a film crew outside and we could not believe it. I realise that I have done something wrong but that was not justied. It was too far. I was accused on television and made to feel like Iaposd committed a serious crime. It was heavy-handed to have the BBC turn up. We live in a small village and it was turned into a circus.    Susan and security worker Jonathan, , listed their home in Bryn Rhedyn, near Anglesey, Wales, online for sale via Zoopla in mid-. Photographs of inside their house - featuring the -inch tall wolf - were posted with the online listing, and a house buyer reported the toy to police. Susanaposs house was stormed by North Wales Police offers on February  this year, accompanied by BBC Crimewatch cameras.  After initially pleading not guilty at a preliminary hearing, Susan admitted three counts of possessing of a dead animal which had been taken from the wild and one count of possessing a dead wild animal, in Caernarfon magistratesapos court on Friday. She said she was blindly oblivious her hobby was breaking the law. She said she inherited the cat from her mother in , found the porpoise skull on a Dorset beach more than a decade ago, bought the large blue butterfly online as part of a collection years ago, and the red squirrel from Ebay for £ in . The other  or so items - including butterflies, an alligator head, mummied rat, ducklings and Victorian house cat - were ed to Susan as legal items.    I am fascinated by it all and I certainly have never wanted to harm anything, said Susan. I never dreamt I might have been prosecuted for owning them, it never crossed my mind. The police said they received information from someone about the wolf online and checkedI had a certicate to own a stuffed wolf, and obviously I donapost. Itaposs ridiculous thataposs how the got a warrant. It turns out I did have illegal taxidermy but the wolf had nothing to do with it. It was just a toy. Without the photos online all this would never have happened. The whole thing has done me a lot of harm. How the police handled it was appalling and I was devastated by it. The cat has been in our family for years, I donapost even know how old it is. I bought a wooden box of butterflies and it was just one in the whole collection that I was caught out for. The squirrel I just bought on Ebay so never ever thought it was illegal to own it. Why can you buy things like that onlineyou can be prosecuted for it  Itaposs ridiculous.

Christina Anderson,  and from San Diego, US, was in May preparing for her dream wedding to Brandon Jensen when the room began to spin so much she couldnapost stop vomiting and was unable to walk straight. She was immediately taken to hospital where she underwent a CT scan. Christina, a nurse, said she  knew something was up as the doctors took a really, really long time to give her an answer. They eventually went up to her, sat by her side and told her they had found a brain tumour just behind her right ear.  The bride-to-be was told that while it was a hemangioblastoma, a non-cancerous tumour, she would still have to undergo immediate surgery to get the -inch lump removed or it would end up killing her.“At that point, I knew what it meant, but I was kind of in denial because I didn’t really understand the severity of it,” Anderson says, the New York Post reports.Despite her eight-hour surgery looming ahead, Christinaaposs only concern was how she would be able to carry out the preparations for her wedding in August while trying to recover. “I asked Dr. Sharmathey’d have to chop any hair off and he said yes,” Christina said. “That was the part that I was stuck on the most because I was like, ‘I’m getting married in August, I can’t have my hair missing.’ ” While patients would usually have all their heads shaved off for infection control, doctors made an exception for the bride and only removed a small lock of her brunette hair.  Following her highly successful surgery on May  Christina immediately started physiotherapy to learn how to walk again. She had to use a walking aid for months but said she would keep hiding it from herself so she wouldnapost be tempted to use it and could be back on her own two feet in time for the big day.“I was going to crawl down that aisle before I had to use the walker,” Christina Anderson told Today . “It was not an option for me.”Christina managed to fulfill her dream and walked down the aisle - evenin Crocs - for her special day on August .

However, her symptoms worsened after falling pregnant with her second child, Ethan, in . Jessica began experiencing severe headaches, dizziness and nausea and was in so much pain she became bed-ridden. She rushed to the hospital but doctors told her that the symptoms were a result of her pregnancy.    The mother gave birth to her second child six weeks early and her symptoms worsened even more soon after. Doctors initially thought she had a spinal fluid leak and took blood from her to inject into her spinal cord to stop the leak. Two weeks later, she had a CT scan which showed that her symptoms were caused by a condition called acoustic neuroma, a benign tumour growing in her brain. The benign cyst roughly measured . inches the same size as a racquetball her doctor warned her thatthey had left it to grow, it would have been inoperable. It had been pushing on her nerves which is what caused her facial paralysis and partial deafness. She underwent an eight-hour surgery where they removed her right acoustic nerve which was causing deafness in her right ear and they had to leave two millimetres of the tumour on her facial nerve to seethe muscle movement wouldwhich didnapost work. Jessicaaposs facial muscle movement has only come back by  to  per cent since the surgery.  For  years Jessica felt insecure about her appearance and would hide herself away until she joined a makeup team who made her feel beautul again. Throughout the experience of telling them her journey and seeing pictures of herself in a new light, she finally felt ready to face the world and claims that it was le changing. I first started to notice symptoms after the birth of my first child when I was only twenty-two I was having dizzy spells, headaches and once in a while the room would spin when I made a quick or sudden movement, Jessica said. I just attributed my symptoms to childbirth, lack of sleep and crazy first-time mum le. I didnapost think much of it at the time. Things started to get worse when I got pregnant with my second child I had severe headaches, dizziness and nausea and I couldnapost get out of bed most of my pregnancy. They attributed all of my symptoms to my pregnancy. When my son was born six weeks early my symptoms did not improve but worsened.  I had c-sections with both of my children and because of the ongoing headaches they thought maybe I had a spinal fluid leak. After one of the most painful procedures called a blood patch where they take blood from your arm and put it in your spinal cord to stop the leak, is when my symptoms worsened. My worsening symptoms became head and neck pain and numbness from my shoulder blades down through my arms to my fingers. I was in and out of the emergency room four dferent times in a matter of a week. The doctors would give me pain medicine to help with the pain and told me the numbness was due to anxiety and send me home with no additional testing. The fourth time in the emergency room my husband stayed an hour and a half after I was discharged to ask why they werenapost doing any additional testing. The doctor told him, apos there was something wrong with your we we would have found out by now. She just wants drugs.apos I felt helpless. I felt like nobody believed me and my symptoms were all in my head. I went back to my OB for my two-week check-up after my c-section and she took one look at me and immediately admitted me for additional testing. By the time I entered the hospital my vision started changing it looked as though the ground was on a slope and I was walking downhill. Also, every time my heart would beat, I would hear what sounded like ocean waves in my head. The CT scan confirmed that Jessica had a brain tumour of a large size that had been growing on her brain stem for years, putting pressure on her nerves causing facial paralysis and partial deafness. Additional testing showed that the tumour was benign.  The neurologist came to look at me and then went to review the results of my scan. He came back into the room and told me and my mother to sit down, she said. He then told me there was something wrong with my brain I had major swelling and fluid build-up inside my brain which I was hearing slosh around with every heartbeat . He said it was most likely a tumour, but they didnapost know additional MRI testing would tell. Those were the most frightening earth-shattering words Iaposd ever heard. A few thoughts were circling my mind, aposI just had a baby two weeks ago. I have an eighteen month-old child at home and a husband of four years who is my le. Do I have cancer  Am I going to die  What is wrong with my brain  After the MRI they told me I had a very large almost in-operable tumour the size of a racquetball on my brain stem pushing on all my nerves. It ran through my acoustic nerve, on my facial nerve and was pressing against my optic nerve which was causing the vision problems too. They said it was most likely benign which it did end up being. I spent two weeks in the ICU so the swelling and fluid inside my brain could go down enough to operate. When it was time, I was brought back for an eight-hour surgery where they removed my right acoustic nerve causing deafness in my right ear, they also left mm of the tumour on my facial nerve to seemuscle movement wouldbut it still caused major facial paralysis. It took a very long time to get to where I am at today it took me ten years after my surgery to take pictures or even videos of myself. I still have and struggle with facial paralysis even now my muscle movement in my face has come back maybe forty to fty per cent after surgery but has not come back any further as of this day. I canapost fully smile, and I have no muscle movements in my forehead or right eyebrow. I was embarrassed and ashamed of my journey my self confidence in losing the one thing that most people attribute to beautywas gone. I didnapost look like other people. I was broken. I didnapost work right.

Shocking footage shows the man flicking down the visor before being confronted with the huntsman spider — which was lurking just inches from his face. The man was travelling with his dad in New South Wales, Australia when he was confronted the terrying arachnid. He told The Sun: Was traveling home with my father, I had tomato sauce on my face after eating a pie from the service station. I went to wipe my mouth and was already leaning forward to look at the mirror then the spider was there.    It was so close to my face. I then filmed it before it ran away. Huntsman spiders  - which live all around the world - are known for their enormous size and can grow to a leg span size of  to  inches. They often venture into Australian homes in a bid to find prey to eat. The large and hairy huntsman spiders are, despite their appearance, not considered dangerous. They are venomous and can cause pain with their bites, but experts say they are reluctant to attack and would rather scamper away when feeling threatened.

qualifiers","story":"Winger Ryan Hedges hopes his performances for Aberdeen can continue to earn him international recognition.Hedges has once again been called up to Ryan Giggs’s Wales squad for the upcoming Euro  qualier against Azerbaijan and friendly against Belarus, both set to take place in Cardf.The -year-old, who signed for the Dons after leaving Barnsley, has played in all six Europa League preliminary games and both Premiership matches for Derek McInnes’s side.The wide man – who has shown he can deliver quality balls into the area and scored against Hearts – was expected to start on league business at Kilmarnock today.His most recent Wales call-up comes on the back of three caps he has already earned, and Hedges thinks regular game time for the Reds – including in the high-profile Europa League qualiers – has kept him in Manchester United legend Giggs’s thoughts.Hedges said: “I’m delighted to have made the squad for the qualier coming up and can’t wait to get going.“I think playing games has been the main catalyst.“If you’re playing games and performing well you’re giving yourself the opportunity to be seen.“Hopefully I can continue getting in the Welsh squad.”There are two league games – today against Killie and next weekend at home to Ross County – before Hedges meets up with the Wales squad and he says Aberdeen “want to get six points” from those.The optimism about the campaign which followed his winner in the - victory over Hearts has been dampened by the - aggregate loss to Rijeka and - league loss at St Mirren.McInnes’ side struggled to an extra-time Betfred Cup win over second-tier Dundee on Sunday, and Hedges insists they can no longer hide behind excuses like fatigue as they try to rediscover the dynamic, free-flowing football they showed just a few weeks ago.Hedges said: “We were off Monday and Tuesday, so we’ve had a few days.“I think the performancewasn’t to the standard we expect, but the main thing is we’re through and now we’ve got to look forward to the next round in the League Cup and to today.“When the games come thick and fast, there’s a lot of things to overcome and the travelling out to Croatia probably didn’t help as well.“But you want to be playing Thursday and Sunday, because it means you’re still in Europe, obviously that’s not the case anymore, but playing with  men on Thursday probably didn’t help going into Sunday.“I don’t think we can hide behind that – we should’ve done a lot better and hopefully we can put it right today.“On the whole, everyone to a man could’ve given a better performance.“I can’t say there were any stand-out performances.“Cossyis scoring goals, but there’s a lot more the team can give as a whole and hopefully we can do that.”Today was set to be a novelty for Hedges as he’d never played competitive football on an articial pitch.Angelo Alessio’s Kilmarnock, who will also be new to him, have a newly-laid G surface at Rugby Park.Hedges said: “I’ve never been to Kilmarnock and it’ll be a whole new experience playing on G as well.“It’s one I’m looking forward to and something I’ll need to get used to playing in this league.”He added: “They’ve got a new manager in who’s trying to change the way they play this season.“We know it’s going to be a hard game, but we need to go there trying to get three points.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d60db43842192.88271329-752x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen councils 30 garden waste charge brings in 7390001","story":"A scheme to charge Aberdeen residents for garden waste collection has injected almost £, into Town House coffers, the Evening Express can reveal.Aberdeen City Council chiefs announced earlier this year households would have to pay £ annually for its staff to empty brown bins containing garden waste.That sparked a major publicity campaign from Town House bosses ahead of the charge coming in on September . vw, px\"  Now the Evening Express can reveal , have stumped up the cash, meaning the local authority has pocketed £, in a bid to balance its books.The council estimates there are , city households with gardens and , of those have their garden waste collected.That means the take-up rate of the new charge is just over % – slightly ahead of expectations.Around a third of  Scottish local authorities have now introduced the charges.The council’s waste and recycling manager Pam Walker said: “It is quite dficult to assess the likely take-up rate for a charge like this, as it is new.“We consulted with other local authorities which have introduced the charge and anticipated a take-up rate of just under % and we are pleased with the number of people who have signed up.“Promoting it on social media and through the press has been important in trying to inform as many people as possible.”Under the new system, only people who have paid the £ fee will have their garden waste collected as of September .Tamper-proof permit stickers will be placed on bins to show collectors who has paid.Anyone signing up now will have to wait  days before their next collection.The permit expires on August   regardless of when it is bought.“As a result of that, it is more advantageous to buy the permit earlier, as people will get more value from it,” said Mrs Walker.She added: “As one particular part of this project, we have allowed for additional resources which will be available for six weeks to assist people.”That will mean the council deploys extra customer service staff to answer phone calls or emails and two staff will accompany collectors on their rounds.Earlier this week, Aberdeen Central SNP MSP Kevin Stewart wrote to the council asking for some people to be exempt.He called the charge “deeply unpopular” and said it was “simply wrong” for disabled people to have to pay.Introducing a discount has already been dismissed by the ruling Conservative and Labour administration.And Mrs Walker said a discount would bring an additional administration cost to the council.“It is important to remember garden waste collection is not a statutory service,” said Mrs Walker.“We would also encourage people to consider disposing of their garden waste using methods such as composting.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.35588506-240x180.jpg

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire. Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year.

The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop.

Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His object is a rare Slave Bible from , intended for use by slaves in the British West-India Islands.

The bible was among , books donated to the university by insurance broker William Euing in .ldquoBob Marley once sang about mental slavery lsquonone but ourselves can free our mindsrsquo. Pro-slavery lsquoChristiansrsquo were very deliberate in editing the Bible to exclude its most inconvenient truths about freedom, emancipation, liberty justice and mercy. Enslaved Africans and their descendants had these mental chains smelted from a peculiarly Scottish mixture of white-supremacist racial hatred and enlightenment rationalist missionary zeal. This bible was as effective a tool of enslavement as any cast-iron chains.CollectionsPROFESSOR Heather Ferguson, infectious disease ecologist, University of Glasgow. Her object is a Citron Bug . It is part of the collection of the anatomist and physician Dr William Hunter, who bequeathed his collections to the university for research and teaching. It originated from Equinoctial Africa and was collected by Henry Smeathman , an English naturalist who was paid to travel to Sierra Leone to collect and send back specimens to Europe to enrich scientic understanding. He and his insects travelled back to Europe via the West Indies aboard a slave ship.ldquoIn the th century, British entomologists carried out important research on the natural history of tropical insects. However, their methodologies were often exploitative, ignorant and inhumane. Today strict codes of ethics govern our work. Equitable partnerships with African scientists, communities and institutes are essential. It is not widely known that the founders of my discipline were involved in the slave trade in such a direct and disgraceful manner.

Objects in museums have the ability to speak to, or share, lsquohidden historiesrsquo from a multitude of perspectives.

From  to , Gilmorehill House was the family home of prominent West India merchants who traded in tobacco from plantations in the West Indies and the United States. Enslaved people were forced to work on those plantations. They themselves had been traded in West Africa for Scottish products such as cloth.ldquoThis is a deep reminder that we shouldnrsquot shy away from the past and face up to the flaws in our history.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour   s tortuous EU twist won   t halt a No Deal Brexit","story":"Europhiles in the Labour Party can hardly believe it. After three years trying to explain to bemused voters why Labour is backing Brexittheyrsquore now free to say what they always wanted: Labour is the party of Remain. Itrsquos out of the closet.Twitter trolls have been sent packing. The high priestess of Remain, the rsquos Polly Toynbee, has given her blessing. The hyperactive Labour peer, Lord Adonis, and the #FBPE philosopher, SC Grayling, are singing a duet of ldquoOh! Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair has been stunned into silence.However, long-standing Labour Remainers are just a little cautious about this conversion on the road to departure. And with cause. Mr Corbyn remains enigmatic, as always. It is not at all clear the Labour leader is personally planning to back Remain.:Bill for Citizens Assembly consultants nears pound,Moreover, Labour Party policy is still pro-Brexit. Its manesto commits a Labour government to accepting the results of the  referendum and leaving the European Union, ending free movement along the way. A General Election is possibly weeks away, yet an incoming Labour government is committed to negotiating a ldquobetter Brexit deal with Brussels.The new twist is that this new deal would be put to the voters of Britain in a ldquoconfirmatory referendum. But there is no presumption that Labour would campaign in favour of it. Indeed, leading figures like Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell would clearly call for voters to reject Labourrsquos new deal.Letrsquos work this through: Prime Minister Corbynrsquos first act would be to approach Brussels for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement. This would presumably include the things they wanted to tag on to Theresa Mayrsquos deal: Customs Union, regulatory alignment with the single market, job and environmental protections and so on.Now, there is every reason to suppose that Brussels would accept this new deal with alacrity, since it is very largely the arrangement it has with countries like Norway and Switzerland. Michel Barnier, or his successor, would welcome a prodigal Britain back into the fold. There would no longer be an Irish backstop because there would be no hard border.

Labour has always faced both ways on Brexit, but the new policy has turned incoherence into a fine art.How would this policy be framed in Labourrsquos General Election manesto  We will honour the  referendum and negotiate a jobs Brexit, which we will advise the people of Britain to reject. And wersquore not giving the referendum question because that would be ldquospeculative.Some in the Labour Party still believe that the ldquoconfirmatory ballot could be Deal versus Remain, excluding any No Deal Brexit. But this would surely be a non-starter. The Electoral Commission would say that such gerrymandering of the franchise excludes too many voters. According to YouGov, more voters are in favour of No Deal Brexit than are in favour of Mr Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.The last time Labour got into a mess like this was over the Scottish referendum back in . Tony Blair did a U-turn on devolution announcing that,the Scottish Parliament was really the ldquosettled will of the Scottish people, as the late John Smith believed, then it should be tested in a referendum. The wrangling went on for months. The hapless Shadow Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, was left trying to explain why there would be one, two or possibly three referendums before the settled will could be determined.:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideHowever, that constitutional imbroglio was nothing compared to Brexit. Scottish home rule was never going to determine the outcome of the  General Election because it was of marginal interest to the vast majority of UK voters. Brexit is the central question that will dominate the coming General Election, and probably the ones after it. Parliament has proved unable to address the question properly, let alone find a satisfactory resolution.If Labour had really intended to pivot to Remain it should have done it two years ago when Parliament debated Article . That legislation made Brexit legally binding, and a No Deal Brexit the default. It was the height of irresponsibility for MPs, led by Mr Corbyn, to vote by a massive  majority to authorise Brexit, on a hard timetable, irrespective of the terms of departure. It was, as the SNP argued, a Brexit blank cheque.Mr Corbyn now says he will do ldquowhatever it takes to stop No Deal Brexit. But this is like waiting till the bus is tipping over the clf before trying to do a handbrake turn. Labour could belatedly have prevented a deal-less departure from the EU by supporting Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement, most of which Labour actually agreed with. It chose instead to walk through the ision lobbies with the far-right European Research Group of Tory MPs.Indeed, Labour could have halted hard Brexit on a number of occasions. It refused to endorse a Norway option, Mrs Mayrsquos deal, or a compromise in the last-minute negotiations with the Government. Mr Corbyn chose to dance around the question, seeking a narrow party advantage. It was all tactics and no strategy and played into the hands of one Boris Johnson.My own view is that Mr Corbyn would be rather content now to see a hard Brexit. This is partly because he has always been a Eurosceptic, but mainly because he thinks Labour could capitalise on the chaos thereafter. When your opponents are making a mess of things, donrsquot get in the way.Itrsquos an electoral gambit, but a cynical one and voters may not go along with it. When the history is written of how the UK came to this situation, driven by a band of hard-right Brexiters over the clf, Mr Corbyn may find he is cast as Mr Johnsonrsquos little helper."},{"url":null,"title":"feels-like-emergency-vet","story":"I WAS always around animals as a young child.

If I look to the right the croft my mother grew up in, Achnahannet, is visible in the distance and I think of her looking out to this view every day.Pit stop: In the summer months, the four-star Old Pines hotel and restaurant is a five-minute walk from the monument for home-made scones and coffee.Spean Bridge is a mile away, downhill and the Edinburgh Woollen Mill cafe is a safe bet, or enjoy lunch in the atmospheric station restaurant.CAROLINE WILSONFROM THE CATHKIN BRAESOVER GLASGOWWhat makes it so special  A breathtaking sight of a city, laid out before you.There are several ways to travel from my home town into Glasgow, but my favourite has always been the long descent of the A, with its panoramic views over the city to the Campsie Hillsbeyond.Its like a neatly organised model town, sometimes tinged with the pink of an early sunrise, sometimes drenched in driving rain. On a clear day, you can spot landmarks like the football grounds, the Science Centre tower and the giant pink People Make Glasgow sign on City of Glasgow College.I can still remember the thrill of seeing this view from the bus on my way to university and the nerves when I took part of my driving test here. Now it is part of my commute to a job I love in a city I adore.Pit stop: Driving means only the briefest of times to see the view ndash pop in to beautul Cathkin Braes Country Parkyou want to linger longer, and take a picnic.ANN FOTHERINGHAMTHE VIEW FROM THE LODGE VISITOR CENTRE, QUEEN ELIZABETH FOREST PARKWhat makes it so special  A well-earned reward after a hike.Best enjoyed with a tub of Mackies ice cream after finishing a two-hour plus trek through the park.The Lime Craig Trail goes along the Highland Boundary Fault, offering further views over the Carse of Stirling.

Its a moderate hike, but it delivers massive reward, and a sense of being high above it all, while looking down on all the hustle and bustle.Pit stop: Head down the south-east side of the hill for a slap-up pub lunch at The Sheep Heid Inn by Duddingston Loch.VICKY ALLANIONA VIEWED FROM MULLWhat makes it so special  With its famous ancient abbey and its back story as the focal point for the spread of Christianity in Scotland and beyond, nobody needs persuading that the island of Iona is special.The abbey itself is wonderful, of course, but viewing it from Fionnphort, the Mull clachan from where you make the short ferry crossing, is an equally splendid experience.Its partly down to the sense of anticipation ndash as true for ees as it is first-time visitors ndash but its also the sheer drama created by the setting and the endlessly changing Hebridean weather. This traveller has never visited Iona and not seen a rainbow at some point during the visit.Pit stop: Check out The Creel Seafood Bar, a shack in the car park by the ferry slipway which sells delicious crab sandwiches.BARRY DIDCOCKTHE OCHILSWhat makes it so special  Its personal.Summers -. July and August I spent in Northern Ireland, thinking about the girl and willing September on. It came slow. When it did Id jump on a train to Belfast and three morelater, just after Larbert, the land would open out and the Ochils came into view.The sight of them meant I was close to her again. I still get the same thrill when I see them now, more than  years later. And I think of all the constants in my le ndash trains and love and the Ochils ndash and I wish I could have them for  years more.Pit stop: You dont actually have to go the Ochils to enjoy the view butyou do the Cafe des Fleurs, Bridge Street, Dollar, offers great home-made cakes.TEDDY JAMIESONTHE VIEW FROM A MOTORCYCLE HELMET VISORWhat makes it so special  Theres a reason that motorcyclists from all over Europe flock to Scotland ndash and its not for the weather or our sunny dispositions. Its the roads and the views. My favourite is swooping down the A towards Loch Maree in Wester Ross, its dozens of islands sparkling like gems set in the deep blue of the water. A view that is never the same twice, as clouds scud across the sky and cast their shadows like secrets.Pit stop: Its  minutes awaybut The Torridon has a relaxed inn just round the corner from the fancy main hotel, which is ideal for walkers, climbers, cyclists, motorcyclists and other scruffy types. Try the smoked salmon or the steak and ale pie.GARRY SCOTTST ANDREWS FROM THE SCORESWhat makes it so special  Is there a more beautul road than The Scores in St Andrews Starting at the ancient, ruined cathedral, once the headquarters of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland, a walk west along it affords wonderful views of other historical landmarks including St Andrews Castle and the buildings of the countrys oldest university.

The reward is one of the most exhilarating views in Scotland.Standing on ft of granite is always going to give you a good view, but this is one of the best. Bennachie is not highbut what makes the view from the top worth the climb is the fact the countryside all around is so flat and you can see so far.:Scotlands greatest drives: Part :Scotlands greatest drives: Part Look there for the Cairngorms, and there for Lochnagar, and there for Mount Keen and over there is Aberdeen and the cold sea.Pit stop: The Bennachie Visitor Centre ndash which is a good place to start and finish your walk to the top ndash has top coffee and sandwiches.MARK SMITHSOUND OF SLEAT, SKYEWhat makes it so special  The view is ever-changing depending on the weather.Skyes famed Fairy Pools, Quiraing and Old Man of Storr may dazzle, but one of the best views on the island is gazing across the Sound of Sleat towards the mountains of Glenelg, Loch Hourn and the Knoydart peninsula. Ive spent many a happy hour watching golden shards of sunlight dance atop the rippling water or thick veils of dark rain clouds sweep past. Boats flit to-and-fro, fishing vessels and pleasure craft alike, and sometimes you can see the bobbing heads of playful seals.Pit stop: Have a wander round Isleornsay, a village just off the A, where the Hotel Eilean Iarmain serves up hearty bar meals.SUSAN SWARBRICKBINNY CRAIG, NEAR ECCLESMACHAN, WEST LOTHIANWhat makes it so special  If you squint your eyes, it looks like a lions head.I could see Binny Craig from my childhood bedroom and took advantage of its steep slopes for fun-filled afternoons spent sledging on snowy days.It is an impressive example of a \"crag-and-tail\" landform, a legacy from the last ice age, with its \"crag\" of hard rock facing west and sloping \"tail\" of sedimentary rock and fertile farmland to the east. From the top, there are panoramic views across the Firth of Forth to the Ochils as well as surrounding West Lothian and the Pentland Hills.Pit stop: Its less than a -minute drive to the Hideaway Cafe at Beecraigs Country Park.SUSAN SWARBRICKOSSIANS HALL, THE HERMITAGE, PERTHSHIREWhat makes it so special  A thundering waterfall.The woodland trails and riverside walks that form The Hermitage are well-trodden by everyone from Queen Victoria to the poet William Wordsworth and the artistJ M W Turner. Among its gems is Ossians Hall, a folly with sliding , a secret handle and mirrored artwork, that offers dramatic views over the thundering Black Linn Falls. It may not be the highest in Scotland ndash that honour goes to Eas a Chual Aluinn in Assynt, Sutherland ndash but it is certainly photogenic.Pit stop: Pop into nearby Dunkeld where theres a clutch of excellent cafes and bakeries.SUSAN SWARBRICKINEOS REFINERY AT NIGHT, GRANGEMOUTH, FALKIRKWhat makes it so special  It glows like a flaming forest and, one of the biggest refineries of its kind in Europe, is a gigantic, sprawling symbol of our fossil fuel era.There are few views more dazzling than that of the Grangemouth Ineos petrochemical refinery at night, a glaring, savage garden of cooling towers, chimneys and pipes, so luminescent it makes the sky glow red. For lovers of an industrial panorama, its magnicent.Yet in these times of climate emergency, that brilliance is also chilling. Best seen from Polmont ski centre or from across the Forth at Culross, its an icon of our times ndash of industry, the Anthropocene, consumption and need, and also of past optimism.It symbolises jobs, energy, industrial disputes. Its % of the fuel in Scotlands filling stations. But it also feels asit is already, certainly should be in a post-carbon future, something that belongs to the past, even as it belches out its beautul haze of smoke and light.Pit stop: The Abbotsinch pub is the ideal spot for a nearby pint ndash and plate of pub food. Or,youd kill for a square sausage breakfast, try the Rumbling Tum food truck.VICKY ALLANROBIN RIGG WINDFARM FROM SCREEL HILL, DALBEATTIEWhat makes it so special  It was Scotlands first offshore windfarm, those white turbines a symbol of a greener, zero carbon future.The Solway Firth, seen from the ridge of Screel Hill, is a thing of loveliness in itself, and the Cumbrian stretch of the coastline has even been declared an Area Of Outstanding Natural Beauty.Whether you think its enhanced by the elegant flock of  white spindles, that seem posed like tall waders, probably depends on how you feel about wind farms ndash and they are certainly not without controversy.:Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part :Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part Such turbines, however, are now a familiar feature in our Scottish landscape, and set to be still more so. The UK Climate Change committee have said we need to quadruple their number in the UK to help hit emissions targets.Last month saw  turbine Beatrice, an offshore farm twice Robin Riggs size, opened off Caithness. But, as turbine views go, its hard to beat the wonder of Robin Rigg.Pit stop: Refuel on indulgent home-baked cakes down to Treats And Eats tearoom at Colvend.VICKY ALLANGRAVEYARD AT CHURCH OF THE HOLY RUDE, ST JOHN STREET, STIRLINGWhat makes it so special  A walk round Stirlings Old Town is always a pleasant way to while away a couple of hours.Theres the castle, of course, with its long and colourful historyand among the many striking buildings nearby is the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirlings second oldest building after the castle. The infant King James VI was crowned there in .The church has an evocative graveyard, in the middle of which stands a little rise, complete with a bench: and its here, on a clear day particularly, that there are some stunning, uninterrupted views ndash of the castle, rearing up to your right, and below and in front of you, scenic plains and distant hills across Stirlingshire and up to the Trossachs.Its the sort of view you could lose yourself in for ages, and it makes you realise just how visually striking Scotland is. .Pit stop: There are ious cafes and restaurants in the streets nearby.RUSSELL LEADBETTERCULLEN BAY FROM THE OLD RAILWAY BRIDGE.What makes it so special  The view is very deceptive as the road into Cullen offers no clue of the stunning vista below.Driving down the main street, the only view is an old railway bridge until you turn left and the wide sweeping bay opens out before you.The tiled roofs of the brightly-coloured traditional fishing cottages of the sea town roll out ahead of you before the golden sands of the glorious crescent beach. A walk on the beach is a must with a very good chance to spot dolphins along the way.Pit stop: Cullen ice cream shop for arguably the best in Scotland. The Cullen Bay hotel, home of the world famous Cullen skink soup with great views of the bay below.ALAN SIMPSONTHE SMALL ISLES FROM THE SANDS OF MORARWhat makes it so special  Best enjoyed on a seat with something cold.The white sandy beaches along the old coast road towards Mallaig are one of the most stunning parts of Scotland. Offering fabulous views of the nearby small isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck, the view is best appreciated on a long summer day as the sun dips behind the islands and bathes the sea and the beaches in glorious colours. The islands seem like theyre floating on the still azure waters.Pit stop: Arisaig hotel for langoustinesALAN SIMPSONTAKING OFF FROM EDINBURGH AIRPORTWhat makes it so special  Its one of the most famous sights in Scotland andyou are lucky, and its not rainy, or foggy, or you are on the wrong side of the plane, or the pilot takes a dferent flight path, then youll see the Forth Bridge spanning the mighty firth.From up here, thousands of feet in the air, youll get an unforgettable view of an epic chunk of Victorian steampunk which was voted Scotlands greatest man-made wonder in  and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Beats coming in to Glasgow over the Laighpark sewage works any day.Pit stop: A steward will be along in a moment.GARRY SCOTTVICTORIA STREET, EDINBURGHWhat makes it so special  Victoria Street is more typical of Prague, say, than the Scottish capital but for the tens of thousands of tourists who wander up and down its stately, curvedits an Instagram-tastic collection of kooky shops and beguiling, eye-popping perspectives.Although not as old as the Old Town ndash or even the New Town: it was built in the early s and originally named Bow Street ndash its just as venerated. The street itself is best viewed from Victoria Terrace, which overlooks it, or from the Grassmarket, from where you can look up it.:Scotlands  favourite bands: Part :Scotlands  favourite bands: Part Visit on one of Edinburghs Open Street days, during which the city centre is closed to traffic, and you can even avoid the crowded pavement and walk right up the middle without having to dodge taxis.Pit stop: A certain JK Rowling used Victoria Street as the inspiration for Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter novel series.

The UK deficit was just .% of GDP.GERS also showed ldquofiscal transfers within the Union were pound per head to Scotlandrsquos benefit, with public spending pound per head higher than in the UK, despite tax revenue per head lagging pound behind the UK.SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay stressed GERS reflected the current constitutional settlement and did not show how Scotlandrsquos might improve after independence.:Alan Cumming: Scots were duped in However, Prof Gallagher, a former civil servant who advised Better Together in , said GERS did show Scotlandrsquos ldquoinherited expectations and obligations and the service levels voters expected after a Yes vote, even without the taxes to pay for them.He said that, despite the Growth Commission prioritising deficit reduction and prudence, the upshot would be massive government borrowing to fill the hole left by Treasury transfers.Servicing this debt would then lead to spending cuts and austerity, he said, arguing the SNPrsquos case for independence was characterised by ldquodeliberate over-optimism.He also said the Commission failed to offer specic growth policies, failed to cost a new currency arrangement, and failed to cost for trade barriers with the rest of the UK caused by Scotland being in the EU after Brexit.He said: ldquoScotlandrsquos fiscal position, set out in GERS, presents a major challenge for the independence movement.

There is a byelection next Thursday and the SNP are throwing the kitchen sink at it, hoping to inflict a shock defeat on the Liberal Democrats.A third of the SNPrsquos MSPs have visited so far, including Nicola Sturgeonand a good chunk of her cabinet. There have also been MPs, MEPs, councillors and staffers from HQ.Itrsquos a fascinating contest. For this is no ordinary seat. Shetland is, on paper, the toughest target in Scotland.The byelection was triggered by former Scottish LibDem leader Tavish Scott quitting to work for Scottish Rugby.When he won Shetland for the fth time in , he did so with . per cent of the vote. The SNP came second on .%.The Northern Isles have also voted Liberal or LibDem continually since .But while that LibDem majority looks unassailable in percentage terms, you can look at it in other ways too.Shetlandrsquos , electorate is the second smallest in Scotland. Mr Scottrsquos majority - based on a strong personal vote remember - was , in  on a % turnout. By-election turnout is generally a lot smaller than in general elections. If it were  per cent, the theoretical majority would be nearer ,. That means the SNP could win by persuading  LibDem voters to switch sides.Then therersquos the last election in which Shetland voted. In Mayrsquos European poll, the LibDems came first on .% while the SNP got .%. In terms of votes, the LibDems got  and the SNP , a dference of just . Turnout was %.The big dference with  was the presence of the Brexit Party, which got  votes, or .%, in May. The Brexit Party arenrsquot standing on Thursday, although the husk of Ukip are.If a lot of Leavers stay home, put off by a two-horse race between Remainers, the fight between the SNP and LibDems becomes a real one. The fewer the votes in play, the bigger the scope for an upset.:Scotland in Union funds sink to record lowOrkney MP Alistair Carmichael this week sounded the alarm, urging Labour and Tory supporters to back the LibDems. ldquoIf we split the anti-independence vote by voting for other parties or independents, then it is possible the SNP could win this seat, he said.ldquoThere is a reason why, having not set foot in Shetland for three years, the First Minister has now visited three times in one month.Of course, scare tactics to mobilise your vote are standard for elections. But other LibDems say similar things in private. ldquoItrsquoll be close, they frown.There is another factor that can help the SNP. Money. At national elections, candidate spending limits are based on the size of the electorate. In Shetland, the maximum allowed by law in  was pound, over five months. But the spending limit in byelections is a standard pound, that can be spent in five weeks.That kind of money - which the SNP has and the Scottish LibDems donrsquot - lets the SNP blitz every corner of the islands.Motivation is also with the SNP. Winning Shetland would show the party can win anywhere. It would burst Jo Swinsonrsquos bubble. Fighting it hard forces the LibDems to spend cash theyrsquod rather not, drawing in subsidies from the UK party earmarked for the general election.If the LibDems lose, they also lose their seat on Holyroodrsquos business bureau, which deals with chamber and committee work, as membership requires five MSPs.So should we all wait up to the small hours on Friday to catch some Holyrood history  I wouldnrsquot put the cocoa on yet.The SNP is still the under-dog, and it sounds it. ldquoLend me your vote, pleaded candidate Tom Wills this week. Hersquos ldquoasking for just  months until the next election, the First Minister added.The SNPrsquos main message has also been incoherent, hyperbolic nonsense. Unable to play the Remain card against the LibDems, it has tried to make the vote about the Prime Minister. Despite Shetland voting .% Remain in , Ms Sturgeon and Mr Wills are promoting guff about a vote for the SNP sending ldquoa strong message to Boris Johnson that Shetland wonrsquot stand for Brexit.Picture the scene in Downing Street. ldquoIrsquom sorry, Prime Minister, but yoursquove been sent a strong message. Remain voters in a Remain seat in a Remain country have swapped one Remain party for another in a Remain parliament. Nothing in Westminster has changed one jot. However, just to be on the safe side...The SNP sounds like a party trying to talk furiously about national issues because itrsquos running scared of its record on the ground after  years in power.ldquoI know therersquos more work to do to improve local ferry services, says Mr Wills of a key issue. He promises a ldquobrighter futurehe wins. Brighter future is code for an inadequate present.:Shetland byelection turns ugly as SNP graffiti sprayed on war memorialIn contrast, LibDem Beatrice Wishart has focused throughout on local issues like ferry costs, poor broadband, farming, schools and the NHS, putting the blame squarely on the SNP for all shortcomings.As one SNP hand puts it: ldquoThe LibDems are not as toxic as they were. The Brexit thing is not going to work for us up there because theyrsquore as anti-Brexit as we are. Wersquore also getting to the stage where people must feel tired of having their doors banged every night of the week.However byelections do throw up surprises, andthe SNP win, there is an intriguing consequence. It would tie the votes in parliament. There would be  in the Nationalist corner and  for all other parties. The Government could avoid embarrassing defeats. It would not have to watch its laws being repealed again by a united opposition, as happened with the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act.It would also put Ms Sturgeon achingly close to an absolute majority. Another byelection or a defection and she could claim a stronger mandate for Indyref.Well, almost. Only  of those  votes would come from SNP MSPs. The other would rely on Mark McDonald, the former minister who quit in a sleazy text scandal. He currently represents his Aberdeenshire seat as an Independent, but normally votes with his old party.If the SNP win Shetland, his vote would become more valuable to ministers and so give him more leverage. Perhaps, after his two-year penance, the SNP might like to readmit him, for instance  He was never expelled after all, but resigned.If the SNP pull off an upset in Shetland, it would indeed mean a brighter future. Just not for the islanders or the rookie sent south for ldquojust  months on probation.

The firm has enlisted the services of Matthew Black, previously a senior energy adviser at the Stirlingshire-based Fintry Development Trust, specialising in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainability.Mr Black said: ldquoShared ground loop arrays are the most effective solution for delivering Scotlandrsquos ambitions for the decarbonisation of heat. Along with the right policy changes in Scotland, we can make signicant progress towards Scotlandrsquos  net-zero carbon target and beyond.ldquoThe race to decarbonise electricity in Scotland has made considerable progress.

How reasonable, though, is it to compare Scotlandwith other fully sovereign countries where in Europe, when we control at most,  per cent of our own affairs, always within the context of Westminster policy, and the remainder is determined in Westminster  Is it not to compare sovereignty with devolution, which, of course, are quite dferent things She then goes on to ask: ldquoHow could we possibly hold a referendum in an atmosphere where factual evidence is so denied by activists on one side  It is clear that the fault, in her view, lies with the Scottish Government. Yet, Westminster can tell us ndash almost to the penny ndash what Scottish spending is, but most of the tax revenue side of GERS is a matter of estimation as the necessary data is not collected. One might ask, why not  After all, most large companies today have pretty detailed sales and costs at regional level, and in many cases right down to inidual establishments, often in real time. Why is this not being acted on Perhaps, the purpose is less to shine a light on economic reality, but remains similar to when Ian Lang, then Secretary of State for Scotland, wrote in a memorandum to John Major when GERS was first published in , ldquoI judge that [GERS] is just what is needed at present in our campaign to maintain the initiative and undermine the other parties. This initiative could score against all of them Lastly, it is clear from published data that deficit is a common feature of most UK regions. An examination of data on almost any measure of economic or financial performance would show London is iniably ahead, often signicantly, of any other region in the UK.There are two ways we can consider this. One is that London is the \"goose that lays the golden eggs\" and we should all be grateful. As Boris Johnson said in : \"A pound spent in Croydon is far more of value to the country than a pound spent in Strathclyde.\"The other is that it clearly indicates an unbalanced and dysal economy, London as the ldquogiant suction machine, hoovering up resources in the UK, as Vince Cable pointed out. Or, as Stephanie Flanders wrote in , without London the UK economy would be very dferent, less focused on financial services and more on manufacturing, and policy changed to suit.In short, we should ask how far the deficit reported by GERSindicates weaknesses in the Scottish economy, and how much it reflects policies at Westminster dominated by economic and social needs where Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WHAT do the Gers figures actually do  Surely all they suggest is that Scotland, with more natural resources per head than any other country, is trapped in a UK economic nightmare. Or do they just tell us that  years of a union has reduced Scotland to a cap-in-hand beggar nation In fact they are an insult. Scotland with nine per cent of the UKrsquos population, they suggest, is responsible for more than  per cent of the UKrsquos debt   Which intelligent person could believe this rubbish What is the case is that lots of wealth generated in Scotland is in fact registered in London so it appears on Londonrsquos balance sheet. And Scotland is then apportioned a share of lots of ldquonational expenditure which has nothing whatever to do with us ndash like funding Trident, building aircraft carriers, paying for the House of Lords, invading the Middle East, paying billions annually for the interest on the UKrsquos pound,,,,-plus national debt and so much more.There is no point in even debating these GERS figures. They are irrelevant. They bear no relationship whatsoever to any economic situation an independent Scotland would work with.GERS is Scotlandrsquos UK deficit.Dave McEwan Hill, Sandbank, Argyll.THE phrase ldquolies, damned lies and statistics came to mind when I saw the dferent reactions to the GERS Report. The report showed total public spending of pound. billion but total revenue, including a geographical share of North Sea oil, of pound.bn leaving a shortfall of pound.bn representing seven per cent of Gross Domestic Product .You today had a picture of a triumphant Finance Secretary highlighting the positive fact that the deficit had decreased to seven per cent from .% of GDP in   indicating that ldquoScotlandrsquos economy and public finances are strong and that ldquoour future will be far brighter as an independent member of the EU, dismissing the overall deficit ldquoas not where we would want it to be.Other commentators looking at exactly the same statistics were not so sanguine about the health of Scotlandrsquos economy, pointing out thatan independent Scotland wished to join the EU the deficit would have to be reduced to three per cent of GDP, meaning cuts to public services or tax increases.Derek Mackay sees the positives in the report but others see the negatives and in particular the deficit of pound.bn.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmCOMPETITION: The Orcadian has teamed up with Highland Park to offer readers the chance to win a limited edition bottling of Highland Park’s Orkney Rowing Club.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed.

Watt struck upon one of his greatest breakthroughs while working at the university in the middle of the th century, forging a lasting association with the seat of learning. The decision is particularly poignant for one of the university’s modern-day employees, given she recently discovered her own family line stretches six generations back directly to the man who played a vital role in kickstarting the industrial revolution. Debbie Beales, who is descended from Watt’s son, also called James, said she and her family were delighted by the gesture. Watt’s ties with the university were formed at an early age. He was just  when he was provided with lodgings and a workshop after joining it in  to work as an instrument maker, manufacturing a range of medical equipment. Seven years later, he was presented by John Anderson, a professor of natural philosophy, with a model Newcomen steam engine in need of repair. The task would change not only Watt’s le, but those of countless others. Inspired by the latest theories surrounding heat to find a way of not only fixing, but improving the engine, by  Watt famously struck upon the idea of a separate condenser, an innovation that improved its efficiency and allowed for signicant fuel savings. To this day, the engine worked on by Watt remains on display at the university. For Beales, the personal links to Watt, and their shared history at the university, is an immense source of pride. She said: “I had no idea of my family’s connection to James Watt until a cousin recently decided to research the Beales family tree and uncovered this link. “While dad passed away a couple of years ago, my gran Jean is still alive and I know that she is as proud as I am of the family’s link to a pioneering figure like Watt, and pleased to know that the school of engineering is marking the th anniversary of his death with this renaming.”The ancestral research showed that Watt’s son, James, had a son named John in . John’s son, Alexander, was born in . His son, also named Alexander, was born in . His daughter, Jean, married Michael Beales, and together they had a son named Robert – Debbie’s father. Beales, who works in the university’s health, safety and wellbeing unit, added: “It came as quite a shock but the more we thought about it the more we realised that there were odd connections between generations – my dad worked as a shipwright, as Watt’s own father did, and although my dad was camera-shy he definitely bore a resemblance to Watt.“I’ve worked at the university myself for  years, and in a previous role I regularly visited the print unit in the James Watt South building, never realising that I had a deeper connection to the man it was named after.“I’ve always been proud to work for the university, and I was always impressed by the school of engineering’s efforts to make engineering more erse and creative when I visited the James Watt South.”Professor David Cumming, head of the newly named school, said: “We’re delighted to be officially announcing the James Watt School of Engineering on the date of the th anniversary of Watt’s passing. “The importance of Watt’s contribution to the field of engineering can’t really be overstated, and we’re very proud to be associated with the improvements he made to the Newcomen steam engine. The world has come a long way in  years, and much of that distance was covered using technology derived from the principles he established. “While we’ve long had a building and two chairs in electrical and mechanical engineering named after Watt, it seemed fitting to mark the start of the third century of a post-Watt world with the renaming of the school, not least because we’ll eventually be moving to a state-of-the-art new facility on the site of the old Western Infirmary as part of the university’s billion-pound campus improvement programme.”The decision to rename the school forms part of the university’s year-long celebration of the le and legacy of Greenock-born Watt. It has included an international symposium, a series of events during the Glasgow Science Festival and an exhibition in the university library which includes a D printed working scale model of one of his engines that was designed and built by students.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find.

Parishioners then enter into the rotunda or principal porch with its high, vaulting ceiling and polished stone on floor and walls. There is access on the two sides to a repository and a staircase for the choir leading up to the gallery. The sheer scale and massing of the entrance porch sets a hallowed tone for the Church into which it directly leads.Parish Priest, Canon Liam Stevenson, spoke of the pride and joy felt by everyone for their beautul new Church.\"As a building it is truly awe inspiring and surely must be seen as an architectural gem,\" he explained.\"Next Sunday, in joyous celebration, we will gather together as a community to solemnly dedicate the Church as a House of God and fitting place of worship for many, many generations of families in the town and surrounding district.\"A house becomes a home when a family lives and grows in love within its walls. Just so, next Sunday the Church of Saint Thrse will become the spiritual home of a Christian people coming together to give thanks and to worship God and to dedicate themselves as a family community blessed by His all-embracing love and mercy.\"Canon Stevenson also spoke of his personal joy at the messages of support and goodwill, which have come from right across the Christian community locally and much farther afield. He was greatly encouraged and thankful for all of this and is looking forward to welcoming Bishop John McAreavey, the clergy of the diocese and many representatives of other denominations to join in celebration at the ceremony on next Sunday afternoon.Architecturally, the building is circular in shape with five annexes housing the imposing main entrance, a side-chapel, the Sanctuary and two side entrances. This design was chosen because of the wedge-shaped site and, also, it provides for a much better congregational area. The Church dominates the large site, which also houses the parish centre and parochial house.A cloistered walkway to the left and right facilitates access for the congregation and the centre aisle leads directly to the Sanctuary. The Altar and all its furnishings are crafted from Portuguese marble and the central focus of the whole building – The Tabernacle – is framed with radiant, jewelled stained glass.Secondary access to the Church is gained from both the Scarva Road side and from the main car park. These lead directly to the cloistered walks and the seating area, which has a huge capacity. The curved seats are fashioned in bespoke American white oak and radiate out from the Sanctuary all the way back to the main entrance. Around the walls there are beautul stained glass windows which depict the seven Sacraments and an eighth one which was specially commissioned to reflect special features of the town of Banbridge: these include graphic pictorial references to Saint Patricks Church in Dromore Street, The Cut under Jinglers Bridge, the River Bann and, finally, a sheaf of flax to reflect the industrial heritage of the town.Natural light and ventilation is provided for the interior at a higher level and one of the special architectural features is the spectacular halo-effect roof-light high up in the vaulted ceiling. Interestingly too, the Stations of the Cross around the walls of the cloister are those which hung in the old Church and which have been beautully restored to pristine condition by the architect himself, Mr Brendan Laverty.SRC raise over £, for nominated charities Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Finally, there is a suite of rooms, which houses the priests sacristy and a flower-preparation room. All entrances to the Church have toilet facilities and the building is fully compliant with DDA regulations. The building is crowned with a spectacular seventeen-foot high stainless-steel cross which has been designed to give a three-dimensional appearance when viewed from any angle. Overall, the construction of this Church is a signal architectural triumph, which will be a place of Christian worship for many generations in Banbridge."},{"url":null,"title":"property magnificent family home on a prime site","story":"Situated on a prime elevated siteoverlooking Coleraine town this superior detached residence, built in , has been finished to the highest of standards.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":null,"title":"alternative arrangements to brexit backstop can ensure no hard border insists dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are continuing to work with the Government to reach a sensible deal as we exit the EU.\"It is time for the Irish Government to recognise the impact of no-deal on its access to the GB market and encourage the EU negotiators to take a more progressive and constructive approach in negotiations.\"She called on the Ulster Farmers Union to use its position on the all-Ireland Brexit forum to press Dublin to \"take a more reasonable approach\".Mr Aiken noted that the past week had seen \"a repeat of every single argument in favour of and against the backstop\".He said: \"I and other unionists oppose the backstop because it undermines the Belfast Agreement and bypasses the principle of consent. Others within nationalism have a dferent view.\"The bottom line is that as long as this stand-off continues, we edge closer to a no-deal Brexit.\"There is only one way to solve this and thats to get into negotiations behind closed doors.\"Sinn Fein yesterday insisted there was no alternative to the backstop. \"The Irish backstop is a key part of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the British Government and the EU,\" a party spokesperson said.\"Boris Johnson voted in favour of this agreement and the backstop it contains. The EU have repeatedly made it clear that the backstop is not open for renegotiation.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"The search for so-called alternative arrangements is like a quest for fools gold.\"This is a distraction from the Government facing up to the real choices. The only way a hard border can be avoided is through sufficient regulatory and customs alignment.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said: \"The EU claim that unless the UK signs up to the backstop to avoid a border they will impose a border. That is a totally illogical position. The UK has said it will not impose a border. Dublin says it will not impose a border. Who is going to build this border \"Meanwhile, a Tory MP has claimed a solution has already been found to solve the backstop problem.Greg Hands, co-chair of the think-tank Prosperity UKs Alternative Arrangements Commission, said it has drawn up a series of \"administrative and technological measures\" which negated the need for a backstop.Writing in the Daily Mail, he said the proposals include a tiered \"trusted trader\" scheme, similar to that used between the US and Canada, which would \"cut down paperwork and avoid routine customs checks\" at the border.The commission also recommended carrying out checks on food and animals away from the border and \"enhanced economic zones\" straddling the border between Londonderry and Donegal and Newry and Dundalk, with \"tax breaks\" and a \"free trade zone\" to avoid duties on goods.However, Mr Hands admitted that the arrangements could not be set up in time for the current October  exit date and would take up to three years to deploy."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them

or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":null,"title":"banbridge academy mum owes me 100 for my a","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Beyond the Battlefield looks after the well-being of the ex-service community in both parts of the island of Ireland who suffer with a iety of symptoms and problems related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .The four walkers hope to finish in Newtownards on Monday afternoon where they will lay wreaths at the Cenotaph in memory of fallen comrades. The -mile walk is being led by Eric Larkin, who served in the Light Infantry, alongside Dave Wilman , Mick Atkinson and Sean Pieres . This is the second year that the veterans have taken on the challenge after walking from Edinburgh to Carrickfergus on the same weekend last year.They are being accompanied by Erics partner Carol who drives a minibus to ensure the walkers are fed, watered and blister free during their trek.The veterans are due to arrive at Stormont on Monday morning where they will be joined by other past and present military members on the last stretch of their walk to Newtownards. Eric said: \"As a veterans charity, Beyond the Battlefield doesnt charge for any service it carries out for its members and relies completely on grants, donations and fundraising activities. \"Beyond the Battlefield helps with things like grants, housing, PTSD, which we have all suffered from, and much more. \"I feel that this is a great cause and Northern Ireland veterans are basically being forgotten about due to the British Armed Forces Covenant not being honoured here,\" he added. The military covenant represents Britains duty of care to its armed forces, infor the sacrices made in the line of duty. The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government enshrined the covenant in law for the first time in November , requiring the Defence Secretary to make an annual statement on what is being done to support the armed forces. However, a long-running dispute between the DUP and Sinn Fein means no action has been taken here, unlike in the other UK regions.

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley. A bit like in a video game.

And to prove it, as part of the course recent guest lecturers have included  Eoin O’Callaghan  ,  Phil Nelson  ,  Tony Perrey and  Gareth Stewart  . As part of the course students have visited SSE Arena, Belfast , London West End Theatre, Output Music Conference, Belfast and have partaken in student collaboration weeks in Kokkola , Talinnand Glasgow.  Rory  and  Grainne  then tell me about the end of year show which is a collaborative effort between the departments to re-imagine popular films, last year it was “Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and included a pit orchestra and utilised the equipment available to students to reproduce scenes they couldn’t perform live on camera. That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,” Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: “PRONI’s mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland’s archival heritage.“This latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time.

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

A long ball over the top caught the Killyleagh defence out with John Murray conceding a penalty and then seeing red in the resulting melee.Up stepped Ciaran Gillan, who struck a sweet penalty only to see it saved superbly by Carberry.In the th minute Killyleagh reminded Rosario that they were still in the game as Niall Walsh nodded a corner back into the path of Dylan Kelly who just couldnrsquot make contact with the goal at his mercy.It proved not the Gillanrsquos day. In the th minute he had a great chance, but managed to smash it over and in the last minute his shot hit the crossbar.With  minutes of football unable to separate the two teams it went to extra time and it was going to take a special goal to break the deadlock.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

We trust that our community collective colleagues will recognise that the sentiments expressed in the recent graffiti is not what we are about.ldquoWe work with people from across the town and liaise closely with them on a regular basis.

We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others.

It would be great to borrow that and put it on display in Belfast.”One of the many fascinating exhibits will be the keys from the infamous Nazi prison of Coldtiz Castle, which were taken by a member of one of the unit’s formative regiments when he was freed in WWII.The museum will also commemorate the history the Ulster Defence Regiment , which was founded in  and merged with the Royal Irish Rangers to form the Royal Irish Regiment in . Over  members and former UDR members were murdered in terror attacks during the Troubles.The Regiment’s motto ‘Faugh-a-Ballagh’was born at the battle of Barrosa in .The plan is to consolidate existing regimental museums across Northern Ireland, including The Inniskillings museum in Enniskillen, the Royal Irish Fusiliers museum in Armagh, and the Royal Ulster Rles museum in Warings Street in Belfast.All three regiments amalgamated in  to form Royal Irish Rangers, which in turn merged with the UDR in  to create the Royal Irish Regiment.Lord Empey defends George Mitchell against Jeffrey Epstein allegations Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The new museum will also tell the story of the story of the disbanded Irish infantry regiments which ceased to exist in  after partition,” Mr Gray said.These include the Connaught Rangers, The original Royal Irish Regiment, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, Royal Munster Fusiliers and the Leinster Regiment.About % of the first Battalion are drawn from the Republic of Ireland, which has jumped to % of new recruits from the south in the current year so far.Asked why so many recruits are coming from the south, Mr Gray said: “Maybe it is the attraction of serving in the British army which maybe has more opportunities to go overseas and go on operations. “Maybe we are getting the word out there more effectively about how great a regiment it is to serve in.“Or maybe it is that the more and more people that come from the Republic have served in the Royal Irish Regiment and so more people know about it... a virtuous spiral. We don’t care frankly, we just love having people join from any part of the island of Ireland.”Antecedent regiments served at Waterloo, the Battle of the Somme and Normandy. in  the regiment was

They might easily mistake it for just another addition to the shelf of new books marking the th anniversary of the Troubles and then cast their eye where. That would be a mistake, for this is more than just another history. It is, in fact, a remarkable insight into Northern Ireland from one of its best writers and most thoughtful observers: one of the few capable of choosing a detached observation point and looking at the problem from dferent angles. Maybe that#s something to do with his passion for photography and an instinct for knowing that the most tellingly accurate shot is never the most obvious one. Anyway, this is the best book that O#Doherty has written.I’m not even sure I would describe the book as history. It is a memoir, the personal reflections of someone old enough – he was  in  – to remember the start of the conflict and yet curious enough to want to know what was going on around him when so many others were putting their heads down, or just accepting the narratives presented from within their own tribe. He retains that curiosity. He also retains a dislike for one-sided, blinkered interpretations the sort of interpretations which ignore the flaws on your own side of the fence, while contentedly blaming ‘themuns’ for everything. In a piece to accompany the publication of the book, he wrote: ‘My book seeks to be a corrective to our history which gives too much signicance to people who did harm and ignored those who made such a dference that now even the political offsprings of the paramilitaries have had to adopt the agendas of gay rights and abortion law reform.’ The Troubles isn’t just a stand-alone event. It isn’t just one story, either. It is the story of everyone of us who lived through it . It is thousands, hundreds-of-thousands of stories, each one from a slightly dferent perspective and each one as important and valid as all the others.O’Doherty is right to say that the stories we hear most are those of iniduals and organisations who want to present themselves as victors of some sort or, at the very least, as justied in what they did. These are the voices and narratives which have tended to drown out the work of those who never lted a gun or planted a bomb, yet whose crucially important work can now be seen in what might be described as a post-conflict revolution which actually began years before the Good Friday Agreement..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button As he notes: ‘The issues on which people are campaigning are more concerned with human rights than with civil rights, with the right of the inidual to identy by orientation or gender or nationality. These issues are less about the relationship between the citizen and the state, as in , and more about the citizen’s sense of self and entitlement to relate to others. The causes are more secular and liberal, though there are counter-causes too, which would put us into a more conservative and religious polity...We still have a ided society that seems to want to ide wider issues between the sectarian factions. So unionists now oppose abortion, same-sex marriage and support Israel while nationalists, broadly speaking, support abortion, same-sex marriage and Palestine.’Personally, I think he’s wrong on the latter point. Increasing numbers of unionists, particularly younger ones, seem comfortable with same-sex marriage and abortion reform and I think the DUP will sht on those issues fairly soon. Stupidly, though, elements of unionism got it into their heads that those issues were, somehow, Sinn Fein demands which is why there was is a reluctance to embrace them as part of a perfectly sensible strategy of equality of citizenship across the entire UK. But I do accept his broader point about the continuing tendency to ide certain issues between the sectarian factions. I was particularly struck by an observation about Jamie Bryson and Lyra McKee: ‘She was the same age as Jamie but represented something , a secular liberal trend in society, away from the old ision. There are still young people like Jamie, as passionate as their forebears about the old quarrel, and some like Lyra for whom the past is a curiosity, not a commitment.’ There were people like Jamie and Lyra in the summer of , too. There will probably be people like Jamie and Lyra in . O’Doherty doesn’t opt for a conclusion or firm prediction: he’s canny enough to know that the usual rules of commentary and observation have never applied to Northern Ireland. But running through his book is the oddly optimistic sense that things are never quite what they seem here meaning that anything, at anytime, is possible. Most people do get on with their lives and always have done, with hundreds of micro organisations and mostly unknown iniduals making the sort of dferences-for-the-better that only become obvious years later. Maybe that is the best we can hope for. If so, it strikes me as a much better option than the industrial-scale rewriting of history and opening of old sores that fill the pages of far too many us-and-them histories landing on my desk.Declassied files: We may not check gun forensics, NIO told IRA and loyalistsDeclassied files: Needham tried to dress up border checkpoints for tourists Coremetrics  Coremetrics

But a confidential  note said that improvements had been delayed after the IRA targeted the sites with ‘human bombs’ – where civilians were forced to drive bombs which they were then detonated remotely..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In a November  meeting with Mr Needham, Lord Brookborough told him that he was “extremely concerned about the delays caused at the ious checkpoints” and the impact on tourism. A note of the meeting by Mr Needham’s private secretary Jenny Pyper said: “He pointed out that from the point of view of the local people as well, these checkpoints were causing considerable delays and...many of the local people had reverted to opening some of the lesser used border roads. This in itself caused problems for the security forces”. Mr Needham said that for some time he had been concerned that “no thought appeared to have been given to how such checkpoints could be made more ‘user-friendly’.”In a June  meeting between Mr Needham, the Army and NIO officials, the minister referred to “the sometimes ‘fearsome’ mode of dress and patrolling of soldiers in Belfast city centre and particularly the practice of standing upright whilst observing from landrovers”.Referring to the visual impact of border checkpoints, he said it was “important not to leave the impression with people visiting Northern Ireland that they were coming to an armed camp”.In a  meeting, Mr Needham said that he wanted a campaign to encourage southern visitors. At that point, he said that , people from Northern Ireland travelled south but only , came in the other direction.America’s top diplomat in Northern Ireland sent the head of the civil service a letter rippling with discontent after he was held up at the border in .US Consul General Douglas Archard’s letter to Sir David Fell has been released among files declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast under the -year rule.The strong letter of complaint was written in April  after Mr Archard was held up for  minutes at the Cloghoge checkpoint near Newry.The US diplomat told the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service that the “inordinate delay” seemed to be “for no good reason”.Alex Kane: Malachi O’Doherty’s new book is remarkable insight into Northern IrelandDeclassied files: Sinn

In what officials described as a “crisp lecture”, the Sinn Féin man told them that “the fundamental point was for the British to withdraw from Ireland, but there would have to be a continuing economic commitment – he suggested the term ‘reparations’ as appropriate – to prevent dislocation and to repair the disadvantages and discrimination caused by British rule.”In another note of the meeting by Jonathan Stephens, a mid-ranking NIO official who took part in the talks but who is now the NIO’s most senior civil servant, he said that the Sinn Féin man had said that Britain, after withdrawing from Northern Ireland, “should subsequently continue its economic subsidy as reparations for the effects of British involvement”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In the same meeting Martin McGuinness pressed the officials again on the refusal of ministers to meet them. He said they had to avoid the process being seen to be “a charade”.A minute of the meeting said: “Mr McGuinness apologised for putting this point to the government team forcibly. ‘This is not aimed at you personally,’ he said, but to those who send you. Frankly it was quite ludicrous that after each of the meetings he himself went out and talked to the press outside Parliament Buildings and was followed some time later by Michael Ancram commenting on a meeting he had not been at.”Mr McGuinness emerges from the minutes as the central Sinn Féin figure who could be truculent and aggressive one moment, then humorous and polite the next.Declassied

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.
