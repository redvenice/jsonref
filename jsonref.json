Also in the photograph are Hall of Famers Josh Gibson (standing fourth from right) and Oscar Charleston (standing second from right)  Link to a different world: William \u0027Happy\u0027 Evans was a hugely successful baseball player whose wife Lillie\u0027s great-great niece is now the Duchess of Sussex          Family: Williams Evans Jr and his wife  is pictured above right in El Paso, Texas, with his wife, Lillie (center) and daughter-in-law, Kiyo Aoki Evans (left). Evans\u0027 son, Bill Evans III was stationed in El Paso as a soldier. His son Bill Evans IV told DailyMail.com that he saw a close resemblance between Lillie and Doria Ragland, her great-niece          Unknown link: Until DailyMail.com told him that Doria Ragland was his step-grandmother\u0027s great-niece, Bill Evans IV had no idea that his family story included royalty. He and his wife got up at 4am to watch the wedding and spoke of their pride    Major competition: William Evans IV played exhibition games with Babe Ruth (right) and Lou Gehrig in New York in the late 1920s. The Yankees duo were pictured in 1929 in Cleveland, Ohio, holding the ball with which Ruth hit his 500th home run  Disgraced: The 1919 World Series ended the careers of Charles \u0027Swede\u0027 Risberg (left) and \u0027Shoeless\u0027 Joe Jackson (right) when their Chicago White Sox were accused of accepting a bribe to throw the series. They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link. But now he has given a fascinating insight into his grandfather\u0027s career as a star player in the Negro leagues when baseball was still segregated          Bill (left), 61, and his wife Cynthia (center) got up at 4am to watch the Royal wedding after finding out about his grandparents\u0027 link to Meghan while they were on vacation celebrating their own Silver anniversary. Bill and Cynthia are pictured above with their son, William Evans VI (right), and their grandchildren, William Evans VI (in Bill\u0027s arms) and Elijah (in William Evans V\u0027s arms)          When Evans retired from baseball, he worked at an aerospace company in Los Angeles as a an inspector.

It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform.

Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen.

Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life.

A Tube strike will be taking place from 12:01am on Wednesday, June 6, 2018 and will last until 11:59pm. The Jubilee line is also scheduled to be suspended on Thursday, June 14 for a second 24-hour strike.Jubilee line strikeWhile the Jubilee line is the only Tube service that will be suspended for the entire day, the Bakerloo and Metropolitan lines in north-west London are also expected to be busy, because commuters will be using these lines as an alternative mode of transport.Some Metropolitan services that call at Baker Street will also call at Willesden Green, however. Stations such as Stratford, West Ham, South Hampstead, West Hampstead Thameslink and Hendon are expected to be busier than usual.The rest of the London Tube network is expected to operate as normal, with no other planned closures announced for the day. TfL will be running extra buses in order to cope with the additional passengers using this mode of transport.          With the Jubilee line being suspended, other lines are expected to be extremely busyWhy is there a strike?Jubilee line staff from both RMT and Aslef unions will stage a walkout on June 6 in a row over a new timetable, that has been imposed by TfL.This new timetable has been introduced so that peak service is extended on the busiest sections of the line by an hour, which will benefit thousands of passengers.However, the unions fear for how the new timetable will impact the work-life balance of the drivers, as it will ‘ride roughshod over current rostering agreements’, the RMT said. With the number of drivers working on Saturdays, a previous arrangement agreed upon in 2015, would be broken.Is the Tube strike really going to happen?Despite efforts to try and reach an agreement with the conciliation service Acas, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘RMT is bitterly disappointed that Tube managers have knocked back an opportunity to negotiate a settlement to this dispute in extensive talks that broke up on Friday. They failed to put a single proposal forward.          Despite efforts to reach an agreement, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead‘It is outrageous that Tube managers are trying to bulldoze through timetable changes without agreement that ride roughshod over existing rostering agreements.‘Drivers are angry at the impact on work-life balance and rightly see this move as the thin end of a very long wedge that could see processes and agreements unilaterally shredded by Tube bosses.TfL’s Director of Network Operations for London Underground, Nigel Holness added: ‘We have adhered to the strict agreements and policies we have with our trade unions. This action is completely unnecessary and I apologise to customers for the disruption that it will cause.‘I call on the unions to continue working with us for the benefit of our customers and our staff and to call off these strikes.’Transformers Bumblebee movie trailer, cast and plot revealedRed Dead Redemption 2 release date, trailer, editions and pre-orderState of Origin 2018: All you need to knowMagic Mike Live in London: All you need to knowE3 2018: All you need to know about the Electronic Entertainment ExpoTfL Tube strikes: All you need to know about the Jubilee line walkoutsWho is Chief Keef?

In other words, it\u0027s utterly stupid,\u0027 said another angry male viewer.           Not everyone was excited about the news on Tuesday morning, with one man claiming the competition no longer \u0027celebrated women\u0027 without the swimsuit segment Kendall Morris, a former Miss Texas who was the preliminary swimsuit winner at the Miss America 2012 pageant, also expressed some disappointment at the news.\u0027As a former Miss America swimsuit winner, I have mixed feelings about getting rid of that part of the competition,\u0027 she wrote in a statement posted to Twitter.   \u0027I have experienced firsthand the benefits of the fitness portion through receiving scholarship money and working with trainers who volunteered their time to teach me how to eat healthy and exercise, not just for 15 seconds onstage but for life.\u0027 Morris, now a local news anchor, also credited the \u0027fitness competition\u0027 for teaching her \u0027lifelong discipline beyond the Miss America stage\u0027.  But Morris added that she was \u0027excited\u0027 that the changes would allow more young women to compete in the program.  \u0027Miss America has and always will be a competition that has empowered young women to pursue their goals and aspirations,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027I am proud to be a part of it\u0027s history, and I welcome the changes for its future as it continues to evolve and represent the women of 2018.\u0027           And while there were some male critics of the news, many more women celebrated the major change and praised the organization for \u0027solely judging women on their intellect\u0027 And there was plenty of praise for the decision on Twitter, with one fan calling the news \u0027amazing\u0027. \u0027This is huge!!\u0027 another added. \u0027We now live in a world that sees the value in solely judging women on their intellect and not their bodies.\u0027 \u0027Bravo Miss America!

Yes because the only way women can be celebrated is in a bikini,\u0027 another sarcastically joked.  Meanwhile, Carlson said she is not concerned that the changes will hurt the competition\u0027s viewership. \u0027Interestingly enough that\u0027s not a highly rated part of the competition,\u0027 she said of the swimsuit round. \u0027People actually like the talent part of the competition.\u0027 Carlson added that she hopes young women realize that Miss America is \u0027now open, inclusive, and transparent\u0027. \u0027I want to inspire thousands of young people across this country to come and be a part of our program,\u0027 she said.            Carlson (pictured before winning Miss America in 1989) is the first former pageant winner to serve as the leader of the organization  Carlson was specifically targeted in the leaked emails among Haskell and others, in which he wrote of tactics he hoped would drive her insane           Leaked internal emails made public in a HuffPost report showed Haskell (pictured, September 2017) and others demeaning the appearance and intellect of former pageant winners\u0027We want you and we want to celebrate your accomplishments and your talents and then we want to hand you scholarships.\u0027 Miss America made headlines last year after leaked emails showed Haskell and other male board members referring to former contestants as \u0027c***s\u0027. In one email, Haskell wrote of tactics he hoped would drive Carlson insane.  Haskell was initially suspended from his role.

Those who know my heart know that this is not indicative of my character, nor is it indicative of my business acumen.\u0027Haskell resigned the following day and, just 10 days later, Carlson was named the new CEO.Carlson said it was a \u0027form or justice\u0027 that she was able to take over the role and saw the volunteer position as a \u0027call of duty\u0027.          When it first began in 1921, Miss America was actually a swimsuit competition called a \u0027bathing beauty revue\u0027 (pictured here are competitors during the swimsuit round in 1945)          Carlson said she hopes young women will realize that Miss America is \u0027now open, inclusive, and transparent\u0027. Pictured are competitors in 1947The selection of Carlson marked the first time a former pageant winner has served as the leader of the  organization. Now the entire leadership team for Miss America is made up of women.\u0027This is a new beginning, and change can sometimes be difficult, but I know a lot about change,\u0027 Carlson said.\u0027My life has worked in mysterious ways. I never thought I\u0027d be the chairwoman of the Miss America Organization, but here I am and we\u0027re moving it forward and we\u0027re evolving in this cultural revolution.\u0027 On Tuesday Carlson also touched on her recent work as an outspoken advocate for victims of sexual harassment.Her lawsuit against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who stepped down from his role after mounting pressure from additional employees with similar accusations, is seen as one of the first sparks of the #MeToo movement.\u0027I could have never expected what would happen when I sued my former employer at Fox News for sexual harassment 22 months ago, but look what happened,\u0027 she said. \u0027Thousands of women have been inspired to know that they can stand up and speak up and their voices will be heard.\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027ve been a beacon of hope to any woman in that process, it has been worth it.\u0027Miss America is scrapping its swimsuit competition | GMA"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/12/4CEDDE3B00000578-0-image-m-46_1528197357633.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury hails EU greatest dream Roman Empire","story":"    Justin Welby deliver the gushing assessment in a speech in Serbia at the weekend, saying the bloc had \u0027brought peace, prosperity, compassion for the poor and weak\u0027 (file picture)Mr Welby said Brexit was \u0027only one of a number of challenges that Europe is facing, and may well not be the most serious\u0027. \u0027There is no sense in which I suggest that Brexit or other crises currently around will derail the European Union or bring about the downfall of Europe,\u0027 he said.But he effusively praised Brussels, saying: \u0027The EU has been the greatest dream realised for human beings since the fall of the Western Roman Empire. \u0027It has brought peace, prosperity, compassion for the poor and weak, purpose for the aspirational and hope for all its people.

Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/19/4CF1F7BD00000578-5809377-image-m-4_1528223340106.jpg","title":"Kenneth Cole deletes tone deaf tweet calling Kate Spade inspiring accessory","story":"    Kenneth Cole wrote then deleted this tweet on Tuesday morning after news of Kate Spade\u0027s death emerged           Spade and Cole are pictured in 2002 at an event in New York City.

It’s a very important market for us. We love to sell cars to Great Britain.’Mr Stadler said there would be no winners if a trade deal wasn’t struck between the EU and the UK, and that it would ‘cost jobs’ in both Germany and Britain. The issue of tariffs was on everyone’s minds, but was still ‘hypothetical’, he said, adding that he hoped a deal would be done, but it was down to the respective governments.Mr Stadler’s intervention will pile pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to push Brussels to stop stalling on a trade deal with Britain. Prominent Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed his comments, and said it was clear that the intransigent attitude displayed by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was out of step with the interests of member states such Germany.Labour is set to keep Britain tied permanently to EU single...Britain\u0027s economy is bouncing back while the outlook in the...Share this articleTory MP Mr Rees-Mogg said: ‘These comments from Audi are very important because Angela Merkel has a good track record of backing Germany’s industrial interests. Barnier has got a rather dog-in-a-manger attitude, but this is not what European business wants. The European Commission’s interests and those of the member states have always been ergent and are becoming more so.‘The unity of the EU is fraying at the edges – the question is whether things will move in time.’Mr Stadler’s comments reflect wider concern in the German car industry that the sector could be hit by tariffs if trade talks fail – at a time when Donald Trump is also hinting at extending his trade war to the car sector.          Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed his comments, and said it was clear that the intransigent attitude displayed by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was out of step with the interests of member states such GermanyThe UK is Audi’s fourth largest market after China, Germany and the US and boasts sales of more than 170,000 car sales a year.In March, Porsche executive Lutz Meschke also said it was in the EU’s interests to forge a free trade deal with Britain.He said failure to strike a deal would ‘put German jobs at risk’, adding: ‘If the EU decides to stay completely negative in the negotiations, it will be very difficult to keep the price level for imports of goods to the UK at a stable level. You will have customs tariffs. It will make things difficult.’Mr Stadler’s comments came as European ports told MPs they could have efficient new customs systems up and running in time for the UK’s exit from the EU – provided ministers get on with making a decision on which model they want.Joachim Coens, chief executive officer of the port of Zeebrugge, said it was vital that an agreement on future customs arrangements was in place by the time the proposed transition period kicks in next March. He said: ‘The transition period of two years if fine, provided we know from the beginning of that transition period what we have to do.’Mr Coens also played down suggestions that a new customs system would result in catastrophic extra costs for business, saying: ‘I believe the costs are not the big issue.’Benoit Rochet, deputy chief executive officers at the port of Calais, also said he wanted more detail from the British Government on its preferred option. Asked repeatedly whether Calais would be ready in time, he replied: ‘We’ll have to be. Time is running, but we will not have a choice, we will have to be.’John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which runs the Channel Tunnel, said they were still waiting for clarity from the Government. ‘In order to make our contingency planning, we need to have a direction to go in,’ he added.Meanwhile, HMRC chief Jon Thompson faced criticism from MPs over his claim last month that the Government’s new customs plans could cost business £20 billion a year.Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said most industry experts, including one study used by HMRC, predicted additional costs would add just 1 per cent – a fifth of the amount claimed by HMRC. ‘You do seem quite out of line with everyone else,’ he told Mr Thompson.Mr Thompson acknowledged the figure was ‘speculative’, but insisted it was his department’s best estimate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/01/4CF49BF200000578-0-image-a-18_1528244801719.jpg","title":"Number people living poverty line UK maybe half thought official figures show","story":"    ONS report said 22.8 per cent of the population is considered poor on the basis of declared income but when spending taken into account, that figure is halved (file picture) Its findings put a major question mark over claims of the poverty lobby that many millions are going hungry and undermines routine demands from charity chiefs, Left-wing politicians and churchmen for ever-larger state benefits to alleviate hardship.The report said that while 22.8 per cent of the population is considered poor on the basis of declared income, the share of the population who are poor when their spending is taken into account is 11.5 per cent.‘The degree of overlap between these groups may provide valuable information in supporting the effective development and targeting of policies,’ the ONS report said.The commonly used poverty line marks anyone as poor if they are living on less than 60 per cent of average income. On this measure, a typical poor person had an income of £11,257 last year, the analysis said. But the same average poor inidual spent £15,829.One in five \u0027living in poverty\u0027 in Britain: Up to 14 MILLION...UK has one of the lowest \u0027persistent poverty\u0027 rates in EU,...Share this articleThe report pointed to the plight of people who are living not only on low incomes but whose spending is less than 60 per cent of average household spending. ‘Those who are in poverty on both measures are worse off than those experiencing poverty on a single dimension,’ it said.Poverty figures are worked out from ONS income surveys, but yesterday’s report said ‘consumption expenditure is thought to be a better measure of achieved living standards’, and examined surveys of family spending.It found that the tenth of the population who said they have the lowest incomes declared they had on average £5,000 to live on, including all state benefits, in the financial year that ended in March 2017. But the same people on average spent £12,800 in the same period on food, drink, clothes, transport, household goods and other outgoings.          The commonly used poverty line marks anyone as poor if they are living on less than 60 per cent of average incomeONS researchers said some people may not be disclosing their full income when surveys are conducted. ‘Certain types of benefits tend to be under-reported,’ they added.It was also noted that ‘people towards the bottom of the income distribution often have multiple income sources, which makes measurement error harder to avoid’.The figures, which did not include housing costs, were based on the Family Resources Survey, which asks people in 19,000 homes about their income each year, and the Living Costs and Food Survey, which records the annual spending of 6,000 homes.Yesterday academic and researcher into the family Patricia Morgan said: ‘A large number of people are working unofficially and are unlikely to declare their incomes. There are many single mothers who are in fact supported by partners, but will be reluctant to discuss it because they wish to keep their benefits.‘All this is ignored by the poverty lobby. Spreading the idea there are very high levels of poverty is their business.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/07/4CF608A600000578-5811187-image-m-3_1528268015655.jpg","title":"Samantha Cameron reveals didnt enjoy time No 10","story":"    Samantha Cameron has revealed she hated public waving during her time in Downing Street.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               Michael McIntyre (pictured with his ten-year-old son) was mugged by two masked moped robbers yesterday as he prepared to drive away from school with his boy in North West London            As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.

Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               Michael McIntyre (pictured with his ten-year-old son) was mugged by two masked moped robbers yesterday as he prepared to drive away from school with his boy in North West London            As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.  Raiders tried to steal Evening Standard editor George Osborne\u0027s phone as he left the BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House in May last year. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

It took too much effort,\u0027 said a woman who gave only her surname Wang.The former resident, now in her 40s, only returns these days to earn extra money as a safety officer, keeping an eye on the tourists.           The island looks like a scene from a movie set and almost every metre of the stone buildings have been overtaken by vines          Vines climbing up buildings, along the paths and through the windows of former homes are so beautiful they look deliberate          What was once home to fishermen and their families in a once thriving village is now overgrown, eerie and abandoned\u0027It was a lot of fun when we were young, going down to the beach to collect seafood,\u0027 she said.But by the mid-1990s the village, which once had as many as 3,000 residents, was largely abandoned in favour of a neighbouring town on the island.\u0027Once people had more money, they all moved out one after another up into the town. That how it was,\u0027 Wang said.In recent years, selfie-snapping day-trippers could roam freely through Houtouwan.However, since last year, local authorities have charged 50 yuan (£5.83) for entry, while confining tourists to a single circular walking loop through a village frozen in time.  The site 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Shanghai captivates tourists with its fairy-tale setting and East China Sea vistas  The big seas that lash the coast made it too dangerous to land small craft, meaning the only connection to other communities on Shengshan was a strenuous trek up a steep, winding path  The seaside village now lies empty because it was more economical for the fishermen to move and work on the mainland Many of China\u0027s villages have disappeared due to economic development, inaccessibility, poverty and social changes, among other factors.Nearly 900,000 villages across China were abandoned or destroyed in the first decade of this century, historian Feng Jicai previously told Jinan Daily News. In 2014, a study on the nation\u0027s rapid urbanisation in rural areas was conducted by Chinese researchers, who  visited 91 remote villages  in a seven-month expedition.  They discovered that some villages with development value have been commercialised with shops and tourism, while some were abandoned as many young villagers have moved away to find work in the city, according to Guangzhou Daily.The famous Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun\u0027s hometown - Chaolei Village in Fuzhou City - was completely demolished because of the construction of Fuzhou Railway Station.Another remote village, Maijieping, located 800 metres above sea level in Yanshi city of Henan province, is home to only four remaining elderly residents after younger families have moved to neighbouring cities.However, Houtouwan is perhaps the most renowned \u0027ghost village\u0027 due to its fairy tale-like reclamation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd72de49c25689edaf925eefc10536009f342747/0_230_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801a69e63a10689f2a8154ace455d858","title":"its been my whole life alan and his photobooths a picture essay","story":"The famous photobooth at Flinders Street station in Melbourne has been the centre of one family’s life.

Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

People will be able to make their homes suit them, personalise them, and make them more aesthetically pleasing.” Van Gurp said he believed that the use of 3D printers in the construction of homes would be “mainstream” within five years.The five homes – being constructed consecutively in a wood in the district of Meerhoven close to Eindhoven’s airport – will be completed by the middle of 2019. They will be rented out by the real estate company Vesteda. “We have to get the permits and the houses will be built in line with all Dutch housing regulations,” said Van Gurp. “We can make all the calculations but we actually have to do tests which involves making the walls in real life.”Asked whether he would live in one of the homes, Van Gurp said: “For the first house we already have 20 candidates, and that is after only a week of having the images on our website. I have three children, and so the first one would be too small for us. But I would live in the biggest house, yes.”All the houses will have foundations built using the conventional methods. “We only use 3D printing where there is value to it,” Van Gurp said.Eindhoven University of Technology has been a pioneer in 3D printing using concrete. Last year the south-eastern town of Gemert opened the world’s first 3D-printed cycle bridge, which had been made at the university."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948084d12f34edaf4929b0d381e8cf92d5303fc3/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daadbdfff8bd91c83a43f7ba8b4dd289","title":"british sculptors in pictures anne katrin purkiss photographs","story":"Cornelia Parker, Elisabeth Frink, Damien Hirst and Grayson Perry are among the artists Anne-Katrin Purkiss captures in striking portraits"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ded461fc6857d1784f72f6d0206ad9e44820ff5/0_166_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d1ee1e897ecd05e5267a3f5807f8dd5","title":"motherhood sheila heti review","story":"In all the literature about motherhood – enthusiastic, anxious, joyfully fecund, heartbreakingly infertile – there remains very little about voluntary childlessness. This is so much the case that the decision not to\u0026nbsphave children may now be more of a taboo than maternal ambivalence. There was Selfish, Shallow and Self-Absorbed, an essay collection edited by Meghan Daum in 2015, and there are a few self-help books. But now Sheila Heti’s book seems likely to become the defining literary work on the subject, perhaps most of all because as a novel, replete with ambiguity and contradiction, it refuses to define anything, and certainly not the childlessness that provides its subject or the motherhood that provides its title.On the eve of her 37th birthday, Heti’s narrator, who may or may not be Heti herself, asks, fearfully, whether she wants to have a child. The circumstances for procreation are unpropitious: she is impecunious, orced and committed to her writing. But she’s in a\u0026nbsprelationship with Miles, a man she loves she likes the idea of opening herself to the peculiar magic of pregnancy and childbirth. Beneath it all lies a worry that childrearing might prove an anticlimax, and a belief that motherhood is a “once necessary, now sentimental gesture”. So, preoccupied by these questions, she decides to document her quest by creating a work of art that might outweigh her need for a child. She structures the process through a series of dialogues with three coins, which give yes and no answers as in\u0026nbspthe ancient Chinese system of ination.The quest lasts three years, until she’s 40, and turns out to be a journey less towards childlessness than towards enlightenment. The narrator begins with a phrase lodged insistently in her mind: “the soul of time”. She isn’t sure whether this collective soul “belongs to time or is time” or whether “our lives – we\u0026nbsp– are time’s soul”. The answer emerges as both, the\u0026nbspgoal to enter into dialogue with the eternal. We use children, she suggests, to distract ourselves from our spiritual deficiencies. Therefore the apparent failure of childlessness can be a way of impelling ourselves into a battle to “erase the boundary between the spiritual and the physical, and finally become whole”, which is figured here as Jacob wrestling with the angel in Genesis.This narrative of spiritual growth is interwoven with a more overtly feminist narrative in which she considers the place of children and childbearing within our culture. She is angry about the over-validation of motherhood and the sense that women’s bodies belong to everybody but themselves. “There is something threatening about a\u0026nbspwoman who is not occupied with children … What sort of trouble will she make?” At one stage she contemplates giving the money she would have spent on\u0026nbspchildrearing to an abortion charity.This sounds hard-hitting, and it is, but it’s also deeply ambivalent, woven as one strand among many in a book that does, after all, claim to be a novel. Perhaps it’s most novelistic in its dextrous use of the present tense (there is a sense of a life unfolding, rather than being recorded) and in the sense, gradually built up, that the book knows more than the narrator does, in her fear and rage and naivety. The most novelistic scenes are those that portray the relationship with Miles, and it’s here that the various strands of the book converge. Conversations, arguments and sex with him provide most of the daily life of the book.The struggle is to bring this relationship, too, into the eternal. Miles frustrates her with his patience and certainty he has a child already, and is satisfied with their coupling as it is, so he doesn’t wish to have a child with her. The narrator is more impatient and wilful, and is anxious that his not wanting a child is a sign of loving her insufficiently. She comes to consider the possibility that his finding her enough may be itself a demonstration of love: “I wondered if his not needing me to be a mother revealed a deeper respect for me and for women than even I had.”The move towards the soul of time, or towards an acceptance of her place within it, is enabled by art and by a reckoning with its place in her life. There’s a moving passage where the narrator sees the writers who have formed her as pulling her backward into the literary past of her forebears, whereas motherhood pushes you into the future of your children. This is a reminder that she has her own genealogy as well as her own literary fecundity.She is asking what her book can count for, and the answer is a lot. It’s hard to do justice to its complexity. This is less a book than a tapestry – a finely wrought work of delicate art. Is it worth as much as a child? Is it worth less? Or more? “The childless and the mothers are equivalent,” the narrator learns. “A person who can’t understand why someone doesn’t want children only has to locate their feelings for children, and imagine that desire directed somewhere else – to a life that is just as filled with hope, purpose, futurity and care.”Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury). • Motherhood is published by Harvill Secker.

The heroes of history and fiction, however, are typically middle class. Our modern novelists like their protagonists to be sexually transgressive, personally conflicted and comfortably bourgeois. For historians, “the masses” often remain anonymous and impersonal. The point about workers, however, is that they are not just poor, but necessarily creative and networked. The wage worker navigates a complex, integrated labour market in which the balance of power is set against them. There is something intrinsically heroic about this way of life. A hero is not a saint and Emmanuel Barthélemy, the central figure of my book The Murderer of Warren Street, was neither. He was, in many ways, a dark and villainous character, but he aimed for heroism. His was a life of daring and adventure: fighting on barricades, escaping from prison, conspiring, duelling, plotting and loving. The true hero, as Barthélemy never quite realised, finds nobility not in hatred but in a generous self-belief. Working-class dignity characterises my selection of 10 books, both fiction and non-fiction. I’m a historian of the 19th and 20th centuries, and my choice reflects this. We should all have our own list of working-class heroes.1. The Chimes by Charles DickensFor decades this Christmas story was at least as famous and beloved as A Christmas Carol. Its hero, Trotty, scrapes a living delivering messages for well-heeled customers. They tell him that his people are ungrateful and degraded. Trotty contemplates suicide, but supernatural visions teach him the importance of working-class pride and self-reliance. This is an inspiring story reminding workers never to give up. 2. The Sharpe novels by Bernard CornwellWellington described his own army, overwhelmingly recruited from the bottom ranks of society, as the “scum of the Earth”. The Sharpe novels follow one soldier’s career from the slums of London to the field of Waterloo. Sneered at by snooty officers, Sharpe proves himself an indomitable fighter and natural leader. As an added bonus, Sean Bean, with glorious Yorkshire accent, played Sharpe as the ultimate working-class hero in the long-running television series.3. William Cuffay: The Life and Times of a Chartist Leader by Martin HoylesBorn in 1788, the son of an African slave from St Kitts, Cuffay the Chartist was mild in temperament, modest in demeanour, and unflaggingly militant in his struggle for British democracy. In 1848, Cuffay conspired with others to launch a revolution from London. He was transported for 21 years, never to be heard from again. So long as honour and integrity are held in esteem, his comrades wrote in 1851, “so long will the name of William Cuffay, a scion of Africa’s oppressed race, be preserved from oblivion”.4. The Journey of Martin Nadaud: A Life and Turbulent Times by Gillian TindallIf Emmanuel Barthélemy had been a little less extreme, a little less violent, and a little less ruthless, he might have had a life very much like that of Martin Nadaud. A French stonemason and socialist, Nadaud avoided the barricades of the 1848 revolution in France, but nonetheless found himself, like Barthélemy, exiled to London. A far more emollient character, he kept his balance and lived long enough to return and take his place as a respectable parliamentarian in the French Third Republic. Tindall’s biography is a beautifully written evocation of a life well spent.5.  Michael Davitt by Carla KingDavitt’s family was evicted during the Great Famine in Ireland and he grew up as an immigrant worker in Lancashire, where he lost his right arm to a spinning machine. He joined the revolutionary Irish nationalist Fenians and spent seven years in Dartmoor prison for conspiracy. On his release, Davitt returned to Ireland and established the Land League, which fought to destroy the landlord system. As an MP, Davitt was a doughty supporter of British and Irish labour rights. In 1903, not long before his death, he visited Russia to expose state-sanctioned anti-Jewish pogroms. Lovable and noble, Davitt was a true working-class hero.6. The Hard Way Up: The Autobiography of Hannah Mitchell, Suffragette and RebelBorn in 1872, Mitchell never benefited from formal education, making her living as a seamstress. Nonetheless, she tells her story of socialist and suffragette activism – and her rebellion against the constraints of married life – with tremendous power and humour. “One of the greatest compliments (not meant as one) that I received was once when I overheard a man say, with a sneer: ‘Hannah Mitchell! Oh! she’s a sort of Dickens in petticoats.” ‘Sort of! Sir, I thank you,’ I said under my breath.” Mitchell’s autobiography is a classic of working-class memoir: inspiring, moving, and often very funny indeed.7.  Out of the Night by Jan ValtinReal name Richard Krebs, Valtin was a worker on the Hamburg docks, an insurrectionist, a professional revolutionary, and a member of the resistance in the early years of the Nazi regime. He was seized and tortured by the Gestapo but tricked his captors and went on to operate as a double agent. Betrayed by his communist masters, Valtin fled to the US where he published his bestselling memoir in 1941. Undoubtedly spiced up, Out of the Night is nonetheless one of the most exciting memoirs you will ever read, a story of idealism, love, heartbreak, extraordinary bravery and tragic betrayal.8. God’s Bits of Wood by Ousmane SembèneThe Senegalese author’s rich novel tells the story of a strike by railway workers. It was first published in 1960, the same year his country won independence from France. The central character is Ibrahim Bakayoko, the courageous leader of the workers, but as the story unfolds the most heroic figures are revealed to be the women. First they follow their menfolk, then they take over the hard struggle to hold the striking community together, and finally they lead the workers in pitched battle against the bosses. There are few better novels dealing with class conflict and colonialism. 9. The Order of Industrial Heroism by WH Fevyer, JW Wilson and JE CribbIn 1923, the Daily Herald, an obstreperously leftwing newspaper, instituted the eponymous honour, a kind of Victoria Cross for workers. During its lifetime, 440 awards were given out for those workers who risked their lives to save others. Industrial accidents were legion: collapsed mines, trains racing out of control, explosions in sewers, walkways collapsing into water, farm animals running amok. The award predictably came to an end in 1964 when the Herald was taken over by the Sun, but the Order gets its due in this fine publication from the Medals Research Society. 10. Harry’s Last Stand by Harry Leslie SmithBorn in 1923, Smith barely survived grinding poverty in interwar Yorkshire. In 1941, he joined the RAF to fight the Nazi menace. He was never opposed to the ordinary people of Germany, and he married one of them. The postwar state, feeling for the first time the full weight of working-class opinion, prioritised welfare, high employment and rising wages. But solidarity is renewed – or not – in every generation. Smith understood the courageous progress of a working class remaking itself as multicultural. In the bleak age of punitive austerity since 2008, he takes his “last stand” for working-class dignity and resistance. He fights the good fight still, in peerless style. The baton is passed on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11694b8ffcf4e919842b0eeac040bdbef986045e/0_50_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=618f246b3683de15f53e486854c425e7","title":"tsb chief receives stinging rebuke from city watchdog","story":"Bank failed to be ‘open and transparent’ over IT meltdown affecting 1.9m customers, says FCAThe City regulator has launched a stinging attack on the chief executive of TSB over the bank’s failure to be open and transparent with customers when an IT upgrade went badly wrong, locking as many as 1.9 million customers out of their accounts.The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of “portraying an optimistic view” of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on.“The FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB’s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,” Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee.The City regulator’s damning assessment increased the pressure on Pester as he prepared to make a second appearance in front of the Treasury committee on Wednesday.In a critical assessment of Pester’s personal handling of the IT meltdown, Bailey also suggested that the TSB boss might have been more forthcoming with MPs on the Treasury Committee when he gave evidence on 2 May. Bailey said at the time of the hearing Pester may have had information from tech experts at IBM who had been drafted in to help cope with the meltdown. “We are … concerned that at the time of the committee hearing, the CEO may have been in possession of an initial set of slides by IBM which provided initial views on the incident, and could therefore have shared more detail on this with the committee.”The FCA has the power to fine TSB over the incident and said it was investigating the crisis jointly with the Prudential Regulation Authority. The system failure happened when TSB transferred customer records to a new IT platform. Noting the extraordinary nature of the situation, Bailey said: “We do not normally make this information public, but given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.” He said Pester and the TSB board were accountable for the decision to press ahead with the systems upgrade.Responding to Bailey’s comments, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said she was deeply concerned by TSB’s failings.“The regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB’s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced by its response to customer fraud and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the committee.“The committee will discuss Mr Bailey’s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.”“In the meantime, we continue to focus on doing whatever it takes to put things right for our customers, and ensuring that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the recent IT issues.” During his first encounter with MPs, Pester was accused by Morgan of being “extraordinarily complacent” after he said the bank’s move to the new IT system had mostly run smoothly.Up to 1.9 million online and mobile banking customers at TSB began experiencing problems with their accounts on Monday 23 April after the bank – now owned by Spanish lender Sabadell – migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group.Bailey also said that the risk and scale of customer fraud had increased since the migration, and that TSB had failed to meet regulatory requirements of refunding all affected customers “as soon as practicable and in any event by the end of the business day after the day which it became aware of the fraud”.The FCA said “operational challenges” still persisted in some TSB bank branches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ac0e66f25182289b94320fdbd82b9f9dae371d4/0_347_5437_3262/master/5437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b32b3e74d428d2c6b3b67e66684c9577","title":"smoked on the water the eel trader reviving an old amsterdam tradition","story":"In the Dutch capital, one man is rolling back the years – and his slippery business is booming. Words: Kees van Unen. Pictures: Julie HrudovaIn the Dutch capital, one man is rolling back the years – and his slippery business is booming. Words: Kees van Unen. Pictures: Julie Hrudova“Eeeeelll, freshly smoked eeeeelll!” These words are once again echoing along the canals of Amsterdam. Half a century after the city’s last parlevinker – or boat-based travelling salesman – dropped anchor, Bas Oosterbaan is reviving the practice.Early every morning, the 57-year-old skewers a dozen slippery specimens and raises them above the fire to let the smoke do its work. Later he casts off and sets course along central Amsterdam’s canals in search of customers.The trick, he says, is to get their attention: a bell, his voice and loud music – classical or old-Amsterdam singalongs, depending on the neighbourhood. Almost everyone on the street looks up when Oosterbaan sails past, hollering and ringing his bell – but only real Amsterdammers buy his eels. “Tourists don’t understand what I’m doing, let alone what I’m selling,” he explains. “Smoked eel is a typical Dutch delicacy – one of the few.”Oosterbaan and his eels are a novelty – but selling from a boat on the city’s canals is not a new idea. Parlevinkers – combining two Dutch specialties: the trading spirit and water – used to be common here. But somehow these salesmen on small boats disappeared not just in Amsterdam, but throughout the Netherlands. The last Dutch parlevinker is thought to have sailed away in 2008 – long after the last one left Amsterdam, sometime around 1965.Oosterbaan didn’t set out to revive this historic trade. Six months ago, he had accepted a job as head of the food department at a university in Amsterdam. But he had never worked anywhere for long: he’d always get bored after a while, or get into trouble. So after a few weeks, when he was fired again, he started to question himself. In search of answers, he started to sail the lakes of Friesland, a province in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that he first got a taste for smoked eel, and began to sell a few. When someone suggested moving his business to the canals of Amsterdam, Oosterbaan, with nothing to lose, set sail. Arriving in midwinter to a city dusted with snow and ice, he found that curious Amsterdammers would flock to his boat – attracted by his singing and the smoking barrel on the stern. Soon the snow melted and it was spring. The days became longer the business better. Recently he was featured in the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool, and even Oosterbaan can’t deny his status as some kind of local hero. Away from Amsterdam’s crowded streets and streams of tourists, there is space on the water – and Oosterbaan and his eels may yet kickstart the rebirth of the parlevinker. There are rumours that a baker has started to sell fresh bread from a boat (though he remains under the radar because he lacks the vendor’s permits).As for Oosterbaan himself? He can’t stop singing. “Eeeeelll! Freshly smoked eeeeelll!”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2953a848ba120aabd2bda28a20416b5a7a798c1f/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=146e0cead1474a759fe59a25c19fbf60","title":"mp brexit public final deal","story":"There will be no ‘final Brexit deal’ for MPs to vote on, and they won’t change their mind now anyway. Instead, take the campaigns to the doorstepsTime is fast running out to stop, suspend or even reverse Brexit before October when the withdrawal treaty is due to be finalised. One of the great myths of the Brexit debate since June 2016 is that there is a “final deal” which can be voted up or down.Nothing is further from the truth. A formal withdrawal treaty is necessary when any country leaves an international treaty organisation – which, in essence, is what the EU is. There may be a declaration or statement of intent that accompanies the withdrawal treaty. Yet that will not be an over-arching final deal that defines the UK’s future relationship with the EU, landing somewhere between the full amputation desired by Liam Fox, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage, and what David Miliband called “the safe harbour” of the UK staying in the European Economic Area or rejoining the European Free Trade Association (Efta), and becoming a giant version of Norway.Instead, there is agreement to keep talking and talking and hammering out thousands of mini-agreements, from creative industry access to preserving some possibility for the City to operate in Europe as it does today.Thus a “Brexiternity” of negotiations could go into 2021 – and beyond, with Theresa May reportedly saying she would like these talks to continue until 2023, after the next election.Michel Barnier told me he was not sure that continuation would be legally possible, as the decisions will be taken by the new group of EU leaders who are nominated to hold the top posts in Brussels for the next five-year EU governance term beginning in 2019.In this period Britain loses all influence, as neither ministers nor officials who currently have a voice, a vote, and sometimes a veto on every EU decision will even be present, as the EU decides how to handle Britain in its new status as a “third country”. We will be supplicants like Canada, Japan or America – knocking on doors and hoping for a hearing.What there won’t be in the near future is a final, definitive, black-or-white deal that can be voted on.That is why Best for Britain, with all the George Soros money behind it, may be barking up the wrong tree in targeting inidual MPs – the likes of Caroline Flint and John Mann – and pressing them to change their line on Brexit.Both those Labour MPs, like Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey before them, have declared their position, and attempts to pressure them into changing their minds would have no more success than the leave campaign trying to persuade Antoinette Sandbach and other Tory MPs who are clear they cannot vote for anything guaranteed to make their constituents poorer.Best for Britain is right to want to take the campaign away from London salons and the House of Lords, because the battle of Brexit will not be won in SW1 or SW3, let alone Notting Hill Gate or Holland Park.If there is serious money to be spent to offset the massive amount of pro-hard Brexit propaganda from the offshore-owned press or – until recently – outfits such as the Legatum Institute, it should be spent on constituency audits that describe in clear language the direct consequences of Brexit for Barnsley, Bootle, Bath, Bassetlaw and beyond. These should be printed on Lidl-style brochures and put through letterboxes in homes across the country.The consequences include: the closure of local horticulture firms as a new immigration bureaucracy stops the current easy hiring of workers the loss of direct foreign investment, as companies seek countries without customs barriers and the prospect of losing European university funding estate agents selling retirement homes in Spain no longer certain about the post-Brexit rights of British expats European healthcare workers across the country feel uncertain and apprehensive about their future.Political Brexit takes place next spring unless Theresa May – and Jeremy Corbyn with her – decide to consult the people again. But full economic, social and cultural Brexit is not going to happen for a while yet – minds can still be changed.

But in Witney – David Cameron’s back yard – a not-for-profit service run by locals is providing a lifelineSit on the 210 for just a few minutes and strangers start to tell you things. They tell you crap jokes. They tell you how they were once ace footballers. About their heart problems. If you’re busy, they fill each other in on their just-completed trips to the GP or Aldi. And they’ll talk about how lost they’d be without this squat little bus turned impromptu social club.“If this weren’t running, I’d be knackered.”“I’d be a prisoner in my own home.”Before getting off, almost every passenger turns around and tells the driver how grateful they are.“See you Tuesday afternoon, Dave. I’ll bring the jokes.”For a mere 15-seater, the 210 holds a lot of different meanings. For its operators, it’s “an ice-cream van”, running from Witney to Chipping Norton through five villages in west Oxfordshire that are otherwise starved of public transport. For passengers it’s a lifeline, either saving them from spending their pension on a minicab or – for the young – begging parents for a lift. It’s a new service run by and for a community that has been stripped of scores of bus routes. And that makes it a journey into a huge yet silent crisis: the shredding of our bus services.Buses hardly get a mention in austerity Britain, yet they’re among its biggest casualties. Since 2010 funding for buses across England and Wales has been slashed by a third, while 134m miles of bus coverage has been lost over the past decade. Behind these big numbers are countless small stories of everyday indignity: of your nan no longer being able to get to the shops, or your teenage son struggling to clock on for a first job of lives stripped of independence, or days out breaking tiny budgets.Barely any of this is reflected in the London papers or what comes out of Westminster. They care more about trains. You can see why – our privatised services are big, costly and riddled with legalised larceny. But even so, buses figure far more in our everyday travel. Then again, expensive train commutes are for the all-important middle class, while buses ferry about the poor. “Bus cuts most hurt the lowest-paid, women and young, and old people who can’t just drive themselves about,” says Nicole Badstuber, a transport researcher at University College London (UCL). Even as he lopped tens of billions off public spending, the then chancellor, George Osborne, claimed repeatedly: “We’re all in it together.”To see what a lie that was, look at the land of the 210 bus. Oxfordshire is where David Cameron writes his memoirs in his £25,000 shed before hosting a kitchen supper. It’s where some of Downton Abbey was filmed, and Oxford colleges sit on billions in assets accumulated over centuries. It’s also where the county council is so broke that it’s flirting with denying disabled children free transport to school. On 20 July 2016, Oxfordshire county council scrapped all subsidies for bus services. The devastation was instant: that same day, 54 routes stopped altogether, while many more were reduced.“Now you’ve got dozens of villages in Oxfordshire with nothing. Nothing at all,” David Miles told me in Witney market square one morning last week. For years the parish representative on public transport, he can reel off routes, timetables and history. “Without a bus service, a village dies. Some people can’t even stay in their own homes. They have to go into care homes.”The local Labour councillor Laura Price chipped in: “Once transport goes, it’s harder for a village to keep its post office, its GP. They end up being these Cotswold beauty spots where people just keep a holiday home, rather than where anyone actually lives.” Miles: “And in Witney we just weren’t willing to accept that.”Those about to be abandoned lived on Witney’s outlying housing estates, usually pensioners who remember its days as a factory town. Perhaps they or their husband had a job with Smiths Industries and got a home on the Smiths estate. Now they are retired, possibly widowed, and depend on the bus taking them into the town centre and back home. Those buses were to be taken off the road with, as the council’s own documents admit, “no alternative services to the estates served by these routes”.Witney’s retirees were hit in 2016 by a national process that began 30 years earlier. In 1986 Margaret Thatcher privatised and deregulated buses everywhere outside London. From then on, any operator could run a route through Witney or anywhere else. Since they naturally wanted the most profitable commuter routes, it was left to local authorities to subsidise services with low margins but acute social need – such as getting sixty and seventysomethings out of the house.By letting private operators scoop all the profit and lumbering the public sector with the cost, Thatcher created a system that was always going to fall apart. It was just a matter of when – and the breaking point came in 2010 when her spiritual son Cameron began to inflict year upon year of spending cuts on local government.Months before the service shut, Labour’s Price hoped to whip up some opposition. The reaction surprised even her. Public meetings were packed out, with passengers, shopkeepers and young people fretting about their grans. “I’ll always remember one lady – she was almost in tears every time she spoke.”This made her wonder: why not take over the service? Sure, it was a bit of a left turn for her – the 38-year-old’s CV could be summed up as: worked in publishing, DJs northern soul records, raises a nine-year-old boy. No sign here of buses as a Mastermind subject. But “when your residents are crying because they’re going to be trapped in their homes, it’s not enough to say, ‘Aren’t the Tories evil?’ This felt like that one opportunity to do something practical while in opposition.”Others soon got onboard, such as bus expert Miles, who now helps with timetabling and routes for free. Frantic tin-rattling raised the 18 grand that bought an old bus, and at the start of 2017 West Oxfordshire Community Transport (WOCT) was on the road. From the start Price wanted the venture to be a co-operative: “We need people to understand they’ve got a stake in making it work.” Anyone paying a quid can be a voting member, drivers get a proper living wage, and whatever profits might turn up are reinvested in the business.The result is a mini-miracle, made of love and sweat. Price and a handful of others give their time for free. If a driver goes off sick, one of the directors gets behind the wheel. There’s no bus depot, just a corner of a yard rented cheap. Even though he’s paid only a part-time wage, the operations manager, Andrew Lyons, works 60 hours a week and will nip off on a Sunday to wash the buses. At 52, he supplements his earnings by driving a minicab the day we meet, he’s booked to do a midnight run down to Gatwick.West Oxfordshire now fits into a small tradition of alternative bus providers. You can find community bus services in east London and west Norfolk. There are also a few of the old municipal bus companies still kicking about, especially in Nottingham and Edinburgh. Price can see the irony of a local Labour politician forming part of Cameron’s “big society”, in his old parliamentary seat, but she says: “This is about real localism – us doing things for our community who would otherwise be abandoned. That’s a Labour tradition, not a Tory one.”After just 16 months, it not only breaks even, it’s expanding. The fleet has gone from one to four buses (none less than 10 years old). The town service runs “like a Swiss watch”, says Lyons, and throughout our chat his eyes barely rise from the smartphone app that keeps tabs on their progress. Other villages kept petitioning WOCT to run a service for them, so this February it began the 210 to Chipping Norton.The 210 takes you on a trip through what austerity looks like in west Oxfordshire. You go through housing estates barely two decades old littered with bus shelters, yet with hardly any buses now driving through them. You see beautiful rolling plains, while lurching over roads so full of bumps and potholes that, as the driver Dave Hartley says, “It’s like driving over braille.” Yet the passengers are so cheery it feels like you’re off for a bit of five-a-side. Everybody loves these buses, although they swear blind that “it’s the older ones who really benefit”. Even the eightysomethings use that line.A Doncaster transplant, Price says: “I know all about left-behind towns, but here I see so much wealth and investment – then you tell people living on the Smiths estate that we haven’t got this little amount of cash for a bus that enables you to carry on living your life independently.” By the middle of the 2020s, Oxford will have a £7bn trainline and road to Cambridge. This is what growth looks like in today’s Britain: publicly subsidised giveaways to a clutch of businesses, transport companies and estate agents, under the guise of building a “brain belt”. Meanwhile, the pensioners and the less well-off are treated as unwelcome tourists in their own towns.Here is the choice: Britons can throw tens of billions at infrastructure projects that show footloose businesses how needy we are or we can choose policies that serve the everyday economy that the rest of us actually live in. An everyday economy certainly includes buses that help people get around their community rather than only zip along a commuter belt.For all the popularity of its rail policies, Labour has been slow on the wipeout of bus services. It should face down the likes of Stagecoach and call for an end to the current wild west of bus provision outside London. It should plan for other regions to have the same powers over bus services as Sadiq Khan and TfL (as nodded to by Theresa May’s Bus Services Act). Support the establishment of more municipal bus services. And it should compel commercial operators to co-operate with municipal and community bus services and even advertise their routes and timetables.You don’t meet many people like Price and the rest who have set up west Oxfordshire’s newest bus company. One Sunday a month, when the buses are idle, Hartley drives some regulars to a garden centre or to Cirencester for free. For all we expect from public transport, it is a community service and it should be run in that spirit. On one of the few occasions I could get him off tracking the progress of the buses, Lyons explained why he jacked in a decent position with Stagecoach for the hassle of organising a local service.“The bus to these people isn’t just a bus: it’s a social club,” he said. “It’s their whole way of interacting with the world around them. Witney is the world as far as they’re concerned. That matters to me more than a secure job at Stagecoach. It just matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d0f55fcd40887725b20a6f4de02cb75f37884ad/1463_376_3110_1866/master/3110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2bfc1b33a18c29865c1e7b4987a49a","title":"ben fogle i climbed everest expecting a rubbish dump but what i found surprised me","story":"A huge clean-up is returning the world’s highest mountain to its former gloryJust over two weeks ago I was standing on the roof of the world, both figuratively and literally. I was 8,848 metres up on the summit of Mount Everest. It was the culmination of many years’ hard work, and the realisation of a childhood dream.I have been overwhelmed by the tide of goodwill and support but one thing has become increasingly apparent. In many people’s minds, Everest has lost her crown. She has become a mountain synonymous with death, exploitation and pollution.The most common question I get asked is: “Is it covered in rubbish?” As United Nations patron of the wilderness, one of my roles is to report back from the Earth’s remaining wildernesses and to act as a voice for the wild. One reason I wanted to climb Everest was to see for myself if it is indeed, as is often reported, “the world’s highest garbage dump”. I also wanted to ensure I undertook an ethical climb in which I minimised my environmental footprint while maximising the ethics of working with the Sherpas. I had heard tales of a mountain of litter, discarded bottles, human excrement. I prepared myself for the worst. The Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee estimates that 100,000 people, mainly trekkers, visit the region each year making the route to base camp one of the busiest and most popular trails in the world. Add to this the thousand people who descend on to Everest base camp for their summit attempts each year and you can see how it might get its reputation, but here’s the thing: I hardly saw any litter, from the airport at Lukla to the summit.The Nepalese have taken on some huge clean-up campaigns in recent years, perhaps to improve their reputation, but also in response to some tragic natural disasters. The 2015 earthquake wiped out the Nepalese base camp, not only with a terrible loss of life but also an environmental disaster after all the equipment from rescued climbers was abandoned. The government implemented a number of requirements including that each climber removes an additional 8kg of litter (not including their own) and incentives for Sherpas of $2 per kilo of rubbish removed. They imposed “litter fines” at base camp and tried to address the problem of human faeces by encouraging people to take bags with them to carry their own poo off the mountain (the same applies in Antarctica). The results have been stunning. The country lanes of Great Britain have more rubbish than the trail to base camp despite the 100,000 footfall I saw one of the cleanest, tidiest wilderness trials I have encountered. One of the most common questions is whether the mountain is littered with oxygen bottles. While I’m sure this has been a problem in the past, it certainly isn’t today. Each bottle is worth up to $500, and in a country where that is approximately the average annual income, no bottle is ever discarded. I saw Sherpas climb the entire mountain to collect a used bottle. I did pass plenty of bottles during my climb but these had been cached by expeditions for their climb and are all removed from the mountain. Base camp, too, was litter-free with all waste being carefully sorted and carried down the mountain by yak. Camp 2 has been the focus of much attention but even here, above the Khumbu icefall, I saw teams of people carefully gathering rubbish before descending back through the notorious danger spot. Once past Camp 2, I only saw a pristine mountain. Climbers were largely respectful, and even carried their own poo off the mountain. The biggest problem is Camp 4, or the South Col. A wretched place, it is littered with stripped tents and poles that have been trashed by the 100mph winds that regularly beat the world’s highest camp ground. The ground is strewn with abandoned expedition gear that has become frozen into the snow and ice. It would be almost impossible to remove it. It’s not ideal, but in some ways Camp 4 is a frozen time capsule of mankind’s relationship with Everest. Thousands have climbed her slopes in the pursuit of their own dreams and aspirations. It is like a slightly rougher version of Scott or Shackleton’s huts in Antarctica a reminder, however unsightly, of our relationship with the wilderness. I have spent time in many of the world’s popular wilderness locations and I would say Nepal should be proud. It is an example of man repairing the damage he has done. As our focus turns to the oceans and the seemingly impossible task of repairing our marine habitat, we could look at Everest as a fine example of turning back the clock.• Ben Fogle is UN Environment patron of the wilderness.

Yet the hundreds of glossy stores that bear her name on the most exclusive streets around the world belie the humble beginnings of the brand, which started with a prototype made from paper and sticky tape in 1991. The designer, who then went by her maiden name Kate Brosnahan, had enjoyed a successful career as a fashion editor at the prestigious magazine title Mademoiselle until she realised that her heart belonged to handbags. With the help of her future husband Andy Spade, she created an initial collection of black nylon bags in their Manhattan home. The duo’s concept was to create handbags that were fuss-free – the antithesis of the fashion excess that had been seen in the 80s – and which spoke to the emerging minimalist mindset of the 90s. Instincts paid off, and after being spotted at several city trade shows, it wasn’t long before Spade’s former fashion editor colleagues were writing about her designs – not to mention toting them around New York. American Vogue editor Anna Wintour and other influential style icons were fans. “The purses became something of a handshake,” said Wall Street Journal fashion reporter Christina Binkley in 2016. “When two women met and saw they were both holding Kate Spade bags, they’d nod at each other and understand they were on the same page.”The next seven years were packed with the kind of commercial success and critical acclaim that fashion designers only dream of. Between 1993 and 1995, sales jumped from $100,000 to $1.5m, and by 1998 reached $27m. It seemed virtually impossible to walk down a street in an American city without seeing that distinctive label swing past you (an external detail Brosnahan, who had become Spade when she married in 1994, had insisted upon).Despite having joined “the status signature company of Gucci’s double-Gs, Chanel’s double-Cs and Louis Vuitton’s LVs” (as the San Francisco Examiner wrote in 2000), Spade’s success was underpinned by the sense of aspiration and coolness inspired by her down-to-earth personality and reputation as a self starter. She told the Boston Globe in 1999 that it was all about finding the balance between being functional and looking good: “Handbags should be both. That’s what designers were forgetting. So many bags can hold a kitchen sink but they’re just big black bags.” In 1996, the Council of Fashion Designers of America named her as the new fashion talent in accessories at its prestigious annual awards. In 1998, she was honoured at the event, picking up the best accessory designer of the year award. They are accolades that hold a particular poignancy, given that the 2018 ceremony took place this week in New York.After Spade sold control of her eponymous label to the Neiman Marcus Group in 2006, the designer took time away from running her own business to raise her daughter. She returned in 2016 with Frances Valentine, a new fashion and lifestyle brand that took its name from members of her family. Spade then legally added the names to her own, becoming Katherine Noel Frances Valentine Brosnahan Spade. While we will never know the potential her last eponymous project could have had under her creative reign, her first is the stuff of fashion legend, not just in America, but all around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dbfe7587d59a333f8a1c6e7b6c2bb27928c612a/0_47_5668_3400/master/5668.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10b50e29dd4d5999205e3a4736af964b","title":"oceans 8 review rating all female reboot","story":"Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Rihanna head up a gender-swapped take on Ocean’s Eleven that suffers from an absence of tension One of the many joys of Steven Soderbergh’s 2001 remake of heist caper Ocean’s Eleven was the experience of watching an auteur, whose work had previously existed primarily in the independent sphere, take charge of a splashy, star-packed studio film. The crackling sexual tension and snappy dialogue of his 1998 thriller Out of Sight gave us a clue that he would be a steady hand with such material but still, his ability to deliver such a dizzyingly entertaining blockbuster on such a large scale came as a warm surprise.The razzle-dazzle was starting to dim by the time Ocean’s Thirteen was released in 2007 but Soderbergh’s confident direction was a swaggering force that lifted the franchise even in its silliest moments. Cut to 11 years later and the format is being refreshed, rebooted, retooled and remixed with key changes in front and behind of the camera. Soderbergh has retreated, with just a producer’s credit, and he’s been replaced in the director’s chair by Gary Ross, whose uneven career has careered from Pleasantville to Seabiscuit to The Hunger Games to Free State of Jones. While he boasts experience with big names and big budgets, artfulness and anything resembling audacity aren’t closely associated with his work and having been spoiled by Soderbergh’s eye, we inevitably approach Ocean’s 8 with caution.But in front of the camera, there’s far less to worry about. In a nifty, if increasingly familiar, update, the all-male crew has been gender-swapped and there’s a tantalizing cast onboard with three Oscar winners, one Oscar nominee, one Grammy winner, one Emmy winner, one SAG award winner and one rising star all teaming up. The connection to the previous series is familial with Sandra Bullock playing Debbie Ocean, the sister to her Gravity co-star George Clooney’s now-deceased Danny Ocean. The film begins as she is released from prison after a five-year stint, insisting that her return to the outside world will be boringly normal, a far cry from her previous life as a con artist.Within minutes however, she’s back to her old tricks: lying, cheating, stealing and reuniting with her old partner in crime Lou (Cate Blanchett). Debbie has a plan, one that she’s been working on every day that she’s been inside, and it will require the pair to assemble a team of specialists. Together they recruit a weed-smoking hacker (Rihanna), an emotionally fragile fashion designer (Helena Bonham Carter), a maternally smothered jeweler (Mindy Kaling), a street-smart pickpocket (Awkwafina) and one of Debbie’s former partners (Sarah Paulson). The target is movie star Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway), or more specifically the Cartier necklace they will persuade her to wear before stealing it while she attends the Met Gala, arguably New York’s hottest event of the year.It sounds like a blast and at times, during the first act it almost is, but while great care has been taken in populating the film with infinitely talented performers, there’s been less attention paid to the pros behind the scenes. While Ocean’s Eleven glided through its many sharp set pieces, Ocean’s 8 inelegantly plods. The smoothness of Soderbergh’s concoction, often smug yet mostly rather charming, has been replaced with a bland impersonality, the work of a disinterested hired hand. Snappy, playful camerawork and a deft David Holmes score are sorely missed as Ross fills his film with plainly shot montages of superficial luxury that fail to feel quite as sumptuous as they should.We know the format at play here and the script, co-written by Ross with up-and-coming screenwriter Olivia Milch, struggles to lend a fresh tone to the formula. Despite the comic skills of the cast, there’s a noticeable lack of wit, a glaring hole in place of the back-and-forth banter from its predecessor. So many scenes feel a couple of drafts away from flying despite best intentions of the cast.Bullock remains a magnetic screen presence and she tries her darnedest with featherlight characterization but her knack for comedy is left underexplored. Like the crew members who surround her, she’s not really allowed much more depth than just her criminal skill. Everyone is defined by their job rather than their personality. Rihanna isn’t given anything interesting to do outside of her laptop, Bonham Carter is a collection of overplayed tics, Hathaway has some fun vamping it up and, regrettably, Blanchett is particularly underserved, her actions mostly perfunctory. There are also brief flashes of brilliance from Awkwafina (who is set to steal this summer’s Crazy Rich Asians) but again, the script doesn’t feed her with the moments she needs to really soar. The film keeps threatening to loosen up and allow the women the freedom to recreate the fun, hangout vibe that made Soderbergh’s film such a rush, but there’s a glaring incompetency here in Ross bringing such talents together and not knowing what the hell to do with them. After building up to the main event, there’s a vague hope that things will finally sing during the heist. But instead of being smart and surprising, it’s sloppy and predictable. Whenever the crew encounters a problem that might bring some much-needed tension, it’s fixed within seconds. The suspense evaporates, and so does our investment.The lifeless direction, the unrefined script, the underwhelming cameos, the distinct lack of fizz – there’s a slapdash nature to the assembly of Ocean’s 8 that makes it feel like the result of a rushed, often careless process. It’s made watchable thanks to the cast but star power alone cannot mask creative inadequacy. Stealing a diamond necklace is bad but wasting an opportunity like this is unforgivable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a0ea4b6765343d908054eaf89aac3485efba42/195_510_4616_2770/master/4616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9106accdbe355238969912550ce99859","title":"what is the most alphabetically top heavy football league the knowledge","story":"Plus: national teams doubling up on club keepers, more Nigerian slang, and successful promoted teams. Mail us here or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Now that Swansea, Stoke and West Brom are gone and Cardiff and Fulham are in, the Premier League has never looked so alphabetically top-heavy. The 10th team are Huddersfield! Is this a record?” asks Mike McCarthy.There were plenty of answers to this one. Here’s Matt Waldrep to get the ball rolling: “Huddersfield at 10th is pretty good, but the most top-heavy Premier League season was 1997-98. With Barnsley, Bolton, and Crystal Palace being promoted, it so happens Everton were the 10th club alphabetically that season. Incidentally, the most bottom-heavy was 2012-13, with 10 clubs between QPR and Wigan.”Meanwhile, Ian Eiloart seems almost offended at the suggestion that this coming season’s Premier League could be an alphabetical record-breaker. “Just look lower down that page,” he barks. “Halfway down the Scottish Premiership, you see Hibs, which just beats Huddersfield. Then you can also look halfway down the following tables, to see these teams:La Liga: Girona Bundesliga: Leverkusen League One: Gillingham Scottish Championship: Falkirk Scottish League One: East Fife And, best of all by far, Scottish League Two: Cowdenbeath. And then Edinburgh City, and Elgin, seventh of 10 teams. “There are 12 leagues listed on that page, and the English Premier League sits eighth of those. So, not even top-half for alphabetical front-loading.”Kári Tulinius has done some serious graft in an attempt to bring us an English top-flight winner. “Huddersfield occupying the alphabetical midway point has been beaten, and indeed was in the very first season of the Football League, 1888-89, when Derby County were sixth, alphabetically, in a 12-team league. Huddersfield rounding out the top half of the alphabet in the English first ision was actually a reasonably common occurrence once upon a time – it happened in 1920-22, 1926-29, 1930-31, 1935-36, 1937-38, 1948-49, 1950-51, and 1955-56.”Bryn Evans brought it to our attention that, in the Israeli second ision next season, “13 out of 16 teams will begin with the same word, Hapoel. A record in itself surely?” Nope. Sorry Bryn. Here’s the list of teams from the Saudi Pro League last season. Spot the odd one out.And in the 2016-17 season Al Wehda were present instead of Ohod, making it a full house of teams beginning with A. And if you’re now wondering if a league has ever finished in alphabetical order, we’ve covered that before. Have a look here.“Has any national side taken two keepers from the same club to a tournament?” wonders Tom Donnelly. Michael Haughey has done the hard yards on this one. “It’s more common than you may have first thought. It’s happened 18 times, at 12 of the 19 World Cups held so far. And it has involved 15 clubs and 14 national teams. In 1934 Al Ahly of Egypt and Brazil’s Botafogo of Brazil provided both goalkeepers for their respective countries. In 1954 Fluminense of Brazil repeated the feat. Cardiff City’s Ken Jones and Graham Vearncombe both went with Wales to the 1958 World Cup as did Dinamo Moscow’s Lev Yashin and Vladimir Belyayev for the USSR. Peñarol of Uruguay have done this twice, in 1966 and 1970. Universitario of Peru did so 1970, Zaire’s TP Mazembe and Unión Española of Chile in 1974. “Others include Club Africain of Tunisia in 1978 and Real España of Honduras in 1982. In 1990 Al Ahly repeated the feat – and will do so again in 2018 with Sherif Ekramy and Mohammed El-Shenawy both in their squad. 1998: Persepolis of Iran. 2010: Amrokgang of South Korea, and Olimpa of Honduras, who did so again in 2014.” Only one club have ever had two goalkeepers selected for a World Cup squad from another country. Step forward Tottenham, home of Norway’s Frode Grodås and Espen Baardsen, both called up in 1998.Last week we brought you confirmation that Dundee United is indeed slang for idiot in Nigeria. We asked for more examples of football clubs’ or players’ names being used as slang around the world. We got more from Nigeria. Olu Alake brings to our attention these two examples. “An own goal is often cheered with the shout of ‘Odiyeeee’! This is in ‘honour’ of the Nigerian defender who scored an own goal in the final World Cup qualification game against Tunisia in 1977. Nigeria needed a draw at home to qualify in their last match. Godwin Odiye, one of the Super Eagles’ finest defenders of his generation, then executed a wonderful balletic e to meet a low cross at his near post in the final minutes of the match to send Tunisia through to Argentina 78. It was 16 long years before Nigeria got to a World Cup.” Oof! “Also, a bicycle kick is called a ‘Sagalo’ in Nigeria. This is named after Brazilian striker Zagalo, probably the first person seen attempting to score with such a kick in the early days of TV.” “All three sides who were promoted to the Championship are currently in the top six with only four games left,” noted Max Bell in April 2011. “I was wondering if there had recently been any other seasons where such success had been found by all a ision’s promoted teams?”Our best efforts take us into the lower leagues, specifically the Southern Division One South and West (the eighth tier of English football) in 2008-09. Three of the promoted sides finished in the top four – Truro City (1st), AFC Totton (3rd) and Beaconsfield (4th) – while North Leigh ended up 8th. The full league table can be found here.“Michael Ballack played 105 Premier League games for Chelsea, and lost only 10,” writes James McKenna. “Has any other player with 100-plus appearances in the Premier League, or another league, lost so few?”“In the 2009-2010 Ereisie season, FC Twente won their only title despite second-placed Ajax having a superior goal difference of +46 over the champions. Has there ever been a greater goal difference disparity between the champions in favour of the second-placed team?” asks Justin Hughes.“Right-back Michael Marrone scored a goal in his only international appearance for Australia, a 9-0 hiding of Guam in 2012,” notes Rohan Back. “Marrone has not been quite as productive at club level, finding the net once in 200 league matches, a rather meagre return of 0.005 goals per match. Are there any examples of players being even more prolific at national team level, as compared with club level?”“Of the 19 managers to have taken charge of New Zealand, only two were Kiwis. Has any national side only ever appointed foreign coaches?” wonders Jack Tanner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fe0ac56da7bbfacc4cebe2c85f5ca5fa8bd3230/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=e0208ba56bd1175b8611b555666df4fa","title":"six of the best new potato recipes","story":"Whether you crave a Scandi open sandwich, breakfast hash or raclette, these recipes make new potatoes perfect for any time750g new potatoes, halved3 eggs 2 tbsp good-quality mayonnaise 2 tbsp Greek yoghurt 1 tbsp horseradish cream Salt and black pepper4 spring onions, finely chopped 250g cooked beetroot, dicedCook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling, salted water for 10-12 minutes, until tender.

A subsequent law created an offence of knowingly leasing a property to a disqualified person, with a maximum jail term of five years.One of the many problems faced by people caught up in the Windrush scandal has been the inability to find anywhere to live when they cannot prove their immigration status.The letter, whose signatories include Diane Abbott, Harriet Harman, Joanna Cherry, Ben Lake, Caroline Lucas and Tom Brake, cited a report from March on the right to rent scheme by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI), David Bolt.The report found right to rent “had yet to demonstrate its worth as a tool to encourage immigration compliance”, Bolt said, making a series of recommendations for change.The letter noted that the ICIBI “was particularly concerned with the lack of any monitoring or evaluation mechanisms that would allow the government to ascertain whether the scheme was having its intended effect, or whether it is creating unintended consequences”.It said the government had refused to implement one of his recommendations – an improved landlords’ consultative panel – and had seemed unwilling to properly monitor the effect of the scheme.“The Windrush scandal has drawn attention to the effects of the so-called hostile environment,” the letter said. “It also provides a stark warning of the consequences that can be expected when ministers and officials fail to respond to the repeated warnings of experts about the impact of their policies.”While the best option would be to immediately end the scheme, the letter said, at the very least ministers should commit to evaluating it properly, particularly how it might make people homeless, or at risk of modern slavery and trafficking.It ended: “We therefore ask that you implement the recommendations set out by the ICIBI as a matter of urgency.”A Home Office spokesman said: “The term ‘hostile environment’ as a description of Home Office immigration policy is incorrect, unhelpful and does not represent our values as a country. “We noted the Independent Chief Inspectors’ recommendations on the right to rent scheme and we continue to take steps to ensure it is implemented and communicated as effectively as possible. “The Home Office engaged extensively with a variety of groups prior to the roll out of the right to rent scheme and it has been subject to evaluation, which found no evidence that the scheme was causing unlawful discrimination, homelessness or additional burdens on local authorities.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12d619320b61e2d15bde448251e7bdca6802f08/0_173_5350_3210/master/5350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a289ac2550d56b173270e43c430a40f","title":"nut allergy british airways served cashews lax response","story":"My daughter and I have severe nut allergies and have both been hospitalised after touching a work surface where nuts had been present. When my family flew with British Airways recently, I told the airline when booking and at each stage of the journey. Despite this, it served some of my family cashews on both the outward and return flights.The nuts were listed on the in-house allergen sheet outbound but not on the return flight. BA’s response has been lax. In one email it advised against contacting its catering department since it would not change the outcome of my complaint. It has offered 100,000 Avios (reward points) per passenger by way of an apology but I’m loth to accept it as I feel that its failures need highlighting. PL, Leighton BuzzardBA seems unable to grasp that contact with a cashew could have been fatal. In a delayed initial response to you, a customer relations operative merely stated that it must have been “frustrating” to have been served “a different meal to the one you were expecting”, and that menus sometimes have to be changed at the last minute for “operational reasons”.It said that while it does not serve peanut products on board, it does not categorise tree nuts as allergens and apologised for “any inconvenience”. It told the Observer: “The safety and welfare of customers is always our priority … we have comprehensive policies to ensure the welfare of any customers with allergies and provide our caterers with strict guidelines.”However, all airlines decide their own policies. Some refuse to ban peanuts and none guarantee a nut-free environment. Allergy UK, which carried out a survey after several similar incidents were reported last year, says that what has become clear is the lack of consistency. “We believe there would be major challenges in enforcing a nut ban effectively,” it says. “Our aim is that airlines educate both crews and passengers about the challenges passengers with allergies face when they fly. We are keen to help them develop more clear and consistent procedures, including training crew to administer emergency adrenaline.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

In her accompanying notes on Genius, the returning French pop star explains how this song sees her take on a macho persona as a way of sparring with male sexual energy – even if there are those who will reject her for it. Also done in French as sister recording Damn, Dis-Moi, Girlfriend is set to HD 80s boogie production – redolent of the guest star Dam-Funk, who delivers some deep, sexy vocal interjections.In a very strong month for rap albums, what with A$AP Rocky’s impressionistically blunted Testing and Pusha T’s Kanye-produced side of beef Daytona both proving excellent, Playboi Carti’s newest full-length, Die Lit, still stood out. His hopscotching flow broke through on Magnolia last year, and that track’s producer, Pi’erre Bourne, is the key to the album’s hazy appeal. For Fell In Luv, he cuts up a sample of a sample – Purity Ring’s lift of Young Magic – to end up with something Holly Herndon might make if she segued into mumble-rap production.Recent months have seen the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy credited with inspiring a spuriously named genre called Healywave (though he prefers Mattycore). To be fair, he has worked with most of the acts connected with it – his Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and No Rome – and to be even fairer, it should probably be called Hutchencewave for its clear debt to INXS. Still, technicalities: no sooner had the term started catching on (sort of) than the 1975 return with a completely new sound. The first track from their third album hooks around a single, strangulated riff that sounds a bit like Room on Fire-era Strokes rendered as a polyphonic ringtone. It’s miles better than that suggests, and completely unlike anything else on the radio. Like always, Healy’s lyrics veer between ludicrous and devoutly sincere, touching on STDs, finding grey hairs in your “zoot” (zoot!) and an impressively self-lacerating description of himself as “a millennial that baby boomers like”. As neurotic as the song is, Healy suggests being kinder to yourself as you grow up the strangely affecting Give Yourself a Try is a sign of the 1975 letting themselves grow in weird and wonderful ways.Speaking of Healywave, there’s definitely a touch of the 1975 in the muted guitar that chimes through the second chorus of Troye Sivan’s excellent single Bloom. But most of this glorious ode to bottoming shimmers by on synths that channel the sense of anticipation and nervousness that Sivan conveys as he plays the part of a receptive partner losing his virginity. It’s stylishly done stuff: his voice on the tantalising first verse is coated in whispery reverb, an invitation to come closer, while the choruses are peppered with subtle gasps that imbue the elegant Bloom with an indecently good sense of lust.It seems far too long since Tirzah’s brief run of brilliance in the mid-2010s – not least the brilliantly scruffy I’m Not Dancing. Similarly earwormy is Gladly, the first single from her long-awaited debut album Devotion (out this August on Domino). Produced by Mica Levi, the track lopes sleepily around a single loop, a heavy, warped piano refrain that seems to pace around in circles and mirrors Tirzah’s state of mind. “All I want is you,” she repeats, drowsy with longing and obsession: “I love you.” Proof that the simplest songs are sometimes the most profound.It’s been a banner month for the Tottenham MC. Not only has he guested on standout tracks on the aforementioned Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky albums – appearing on stage with the latter and a giant crash test dummy head in London – he has also released one of his strongest solo tracks ever. Over a minimalist beat that perfectly encapsulates the way he currently straddles grime and US rap, Pure Water sees him announce his own greatness with armour-plated self-confidence.Thirty-four years ago, Prophet self-released 1,000 copies of Right on Time, an album of scuffed, wonky but compelling electro-funk that disappeared without trace. But it was coveted by Stones Throw label head Peanut Butter Wolf, who met with Prophet and got him in the studio to finally do the follow-up. Tonight is a rerecorded version of a track from his debut, which was covered by Nite Jewel in 2011, who turns up here to join in the homecoming: a magnificent, stumbling funk jam. Nite Jewel – one of the most underrated songwriters around today – has her own track on the playlist too, On Your Own, a Hi-NRG synth workout topped with a soaring vocal.The Brooklyn garage rockers keep knocking out classic after classic, with new LP Wide Awake! another essential collection of varied, literate, totally satisfying jams. One highlight, Freebird II – the title typical of their droll hipster humour – features a big, satisfying organ melody matched by a blokey singalong for the chorus. Andrew Savage’s verses are like a positivist spin on those from Human Performance, the title lament from the band’s last album.Miss Red was born in Israel to Moroccan-Polish parents but, with her girlish patois, she sounds more like she was brought up in a Kingston ghetto. Pairing her once more with producer the Bug, who she accosted at a Tel Aviv rave and went on to tour and record with, Dagga is the first track from her debut album. One of the Bug’s hallmark industrial-dancehall riddims rides under Miss Red’s coquettish singsong vocals.Fresh from a brilliant score for the Robert Pattison thriller Good Time, and following a string of albums of densely splintered electronics, Daniel Lopatin has released an ambitious new record in Age Of. It finds space for drunken harpsichords, Anohni, terrifying shouting, tender Bon Iver-style digital songcraft, harsh trap and jazzy synth solos, and yet hangs together: he is the great sonic essayist of our voracious, always-on culture. The highlight is the symphonic Toys 2, his biggest, cheesiest moment yet, and his most moving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5b0c810839f4a11c22c1bbf2ec7583cf37924ec/2089_558_1505_903/master/1505.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f7dc4a109e5a57791881689876aa2e","title":"camila cabello review o2 academy glasgow","story":"O2 Academy, GlasgowDressed in a gothic ensemble that belies her mojito-friendly pop, the former Fifth Harmony member showed just how far she’s come with a joyful, energised performanceHanging platinum records on the wall is passé. In the streaming age, Spotify stats are the new measures of pop success, and Camila Cabello has been racking up some seemingly bulletproof benchmarks. Her debut solo album Camila – which had the melodramatic working title of The Hurting, the Healing, the Loving before she opted for the Ronseal route – was released in the doldrums of January. By February, it had been streamed a billion times. Her amiably woozy single Havana, a seductive earworm that has proved to be the most in-demand Cuban export since Cohiba cigars, recently became the most-streamed song ever by a solo female artist.This accelerated, seemingly unstoppable ascent is all the more impressive considering Cabello started out at 15 as part of Fifth Harmony, a girl group assembled by Simon Cowell from a clutch of US X Factor hopefuls in a conspicuous attempt to create a distaff One Direction. While they never fully clicked in the UK, Fifth Harmony shifted a hefty amount of units in the US, though since Cabello’s fractious departure in 2016 the group’s subsequent chaotic career flame-out feels comparable to the fate of booster rockets used to launch space shuttles.Cabello certainly feels established in her own separate orbit now, leaving her pop-puppet past far behind and clearly relishing her autonomy. On the opening night of her first European solo tour, the 21-year-old unexpectedly goes full goth, emerging in a lace bolero cape, spider-web tights and fingerless gloves. If this ensemble seems slightly at odds with Cabello’s sultry popular image of sundresses and mojitos on the beach, it does at least chime with the more emotionally forensic aspects of her songs, or at least the ones that treat passionate relationships like crime scenes to be examined.Her moody opener Never Be the Same taps into the narcotic, almost vampiric nature of love – “you’re in my blood, you’re in my veins”, she sings – while on the plaintive, minor-key In the Dark, she requests all the house lights get switched off to literalise the experience. Winningly, she sticks to her goth guns throughout this 80-minute gig – her six tireless, tumbling dancers get all the costume changes – although the Elvira effect is diminished slightly simply because Cabello cannot stop grinning in response to the high-pitched enthusiasm of the crowd.This solo tour overlaps with UK dates supporting Taylor Swift – a hint at the multitasking work ethic required to sustain a pop career in 2018 – and Cabello has a similarly big-sister approach when interacting with fans, taking regular time outs to preach a gospel of self-care and self-love. On the sparse, acoustic guitar sway of Real Friends, she hoists a handful of them up on stage to help out with the chorus, and they seem genuinely awestruck.It is a heady, energised mix of bangers and ballads with the odd joyful detour. On the clipped, slick pop-crunch of Into It, the band briefly zigzag into Prince’s Kiss, and you get the sense the purple one might approve of a lyric such as, “I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it”, especially delivered with Cabello’s whipcrack timing. Inevitably, she closes with her signature hit. As the slightly battered piano intro of Havana creaks into life, Cabello is haloed by footage of a huge orange sunrise: two gigantic stars for the price of one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59e7f520f069376c91e227b8f9fb3091e3ddffb4/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df3e17e6cc2d992b636e617ce49f9c3","title":"a bright peafowl and a spacecraft blessing tuesdays best photos","story":"’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world, including a Hawaiian eruption and a marathon swimmer in Japan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82e08aa3ba94f5c0ddfdf0ca3b18061c467c1b3/0_30_4162_2498/master/4162.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8c33129777ce4d7476116a83d9deb6","title":"labour reveals scheme to maintain access to eu single market","story":"Keir Starmer insists ‘internal market’ proposal will deliver full access to the single market, with no new impediments to tradeLabour is proposing an “internal market” that would deliver a new and close relationship with the European Union but falls short of membership of the single market while maintaining many of its advantages.The proposal was heralded by some as the party’s most significant move so far towards a soft Brexit.But the move stops just short of calling for the full single market membership sought by a vocal group of Labour MPs, after the Lords backed a Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area (EEA).Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.”The proposal, tabled as an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill ahead of its return to the Commons next Tuesday, fleshes out proposals originally made in a speech by Jeremy Corbyn in Coventry in February.Corbyn said: “We are confident we can build a new relationship with the EU. We want the UK to have a better deal than the Norway model.”The timing reflects anxiety among the party leadership about a looming revolt by pro-EU backbenchers on EEA membership.Labour peers ambushed the party leadership last month when the amendment, tabled by Lord Alli, demanded that remaining a member of the EEA was a negotiating objective.The EU’s single market is more than a free-trade area. It aims to remove not just the fiscal barriers to trade (tariffs) but the physical and technical barriers (borders and ergent product standards) too by allowing as free movement as possible of goods, capital, services and people. In essence, it is about treating the EU as a single trading territory.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Although EU negotiators have repeatedly made it clear that there can be no cherry picking to the UK’s advantage in the negotiations, Starmer insists the new proposal would deliver full access to the single market, backed by EU-agreed standards, rights and protections. There would be shared UK-EU institutions and regulations, and no new impediments to trade.“Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result,” he said. “Labour’s amendment, along with a commitment to negotiate a new comprehensive customs union with the EU, is a strong and balanced package that would retain the benefits of the single market.”But Chris Leslie, a leading Labour remainer, said: “If the frontbench are missing the opportunity to secure the EEA single market as a UK negotiating objective, there will be utter dismay and shock across the Labour movement.”Another Labour rebel said the leadership had “scrapped the Lords amendment (which is the only one the Tories will support) and replaced it with fudge”.Former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said the party should back the Lords push for EEA membership instead.The Labour MP said Tory MPs “won’t vote for a Labour frontbench amendment” and if the party was “serious” about averting a hard Brexit “we must vote for the existing backbench cross-party Lords amendment”.Some Tory rebels are also looking at some form of relationship as close to the EEA as possible, as a way of averting a catastrophic departure from the EU.Membership of the EEA itself is incompatible with either Theresa May’s red lines or Jeremy Corbyn’s concerns about the restrictions it would place on the ability of government to intervene in industry or procurement.Members of the EEA such as Norway, which is not in the EU, belong to the single market but – as Norway’s prime minister made clear in an interview on Tuesday – that means accepting the so-called “four freedoms”, including freedom of movement.The official deadline for new amendments to the EU withdrawal bill falls on Thursday and Tory rebels are increasingly optimistic that the government is ready to make concessions.Officially the government is committed to reversing all 15 of the defeats inflicted by the Lords on the key piece of legislation that must be passed before the process of leaving the EU can begin.But on Tuesday night one senior backbencher who has led revolts in the past suggested that were signs of movement by the government on a meaningful vote. The amendment was one of the most significant victories in the Lords. It would prevent May offering only a take-it-or-leave-it vote on the final deal and give parliament a role in negotiations.Iain Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiter, also accepted that there could be some acceptable concessions, including on the “meaningful vote”.The European Union is a customs union. It allows free trade between countries inside it and allows imports in to the area by setting common tariffs. The area does not just include EU members. For instance, Turkey is part of the customs union for manufactured goods but not services or agriculture. The single market involves deeper integration of free movement of people, goods, services and money. This means laws need to be aligned. Some countries have access to the single market without being members of the EU’s customs union.“This bill is the critical bill. The government is right to bring it forward. It defines our departure, and it defines our negotiations,” he said, pointing out that MPs nodded the bill through on its third reading in the Commons earlier this year.Brexiters believe getting the withdrawal bill on the statute book before the key European council meeting at the end of June – barely a fortnight away – would strengthen May’s hand in negotiations, as there will be no prospect of her being forced by parliament to accept, for example, a customs union.There are likely to be other revolts, however. Rebels believe the Lords amendment tabled by the architect of article 50, Lord Kerr, on the customs union, could be upheld in the Commons. It would require the government to make a statement outlining its efforts to negotiate a customs union.That vote could be a key test of opinion in the Commons ahead of a more substantive amendment to the trade bill that has been tabled by Tory rebels.There is also likely to be a significant row over the scheduling of the consideration of the amendments. Only one day has been set aside to consider all amendments, which could mean an all-night sitting on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac6f40e697fd5e53ab5c5c0a3116ec848b1f745/0_372_3377_2027/master/3377.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea78a5b36631b3fe7ead73b176d739ee","title":"what is keir starmers internal market brexit proposal","story":"Amendment is as close as Labour can get to single market membership without being EU memberKeir Starmer, shadow Brexit secretary, is proposing an “internal market” that would deliver a new and close relationship with the EU but falls short of membership of the single market while maintaining many of its advantages.Does this shift mean Labour backs a much softer Brexit?It’s another significant step in that direction – the language in Starmer’s new amendment, about “shared institutions” with the EU, and “full access” to the “internal market”, is as close as the party feels it can come to single market membership without going the whole hog.So why not just say we want to remain members of the single market? Two reasons: one, key members of the shadow cabinet (and quite a few backbenchers with pro-Leave constituencies) believe the referendum result revealed that voters want to see immigration control on a scale incompatible with free movement.And two, Jeremy Corbyn’s team believe that full membership, which would require compliance with the EU competition regime for example, would constrain their ability to intervene radically in the economy.Nevertheless, Labour can edge closer to single market membership than Theresa May, because it’s more relaxed about European court of justice oversight and is happy to agree not to undercut EU regulations – on the environment and workers’ rights, for example.Some members of the shadow cabinet, led by Starmer but also including Diane Abbott from a slightly different, pro-migration perspective, have been pushing for a softening of the party’s Brexit line for some time but the leadership’s hand has been forced by parliamentary timing.With the EU withdrawal bill coming back to the House of Commons next Tuesday, they had to decide how to vote on the Lords amendment aimed at keeping Britain in the EEA, which scores of Labour MPs were likely to back.Will this new amendment pass?Almost certainly not – as rebel Tory backbenchers are highly unlikely to support an amendment with Corbyn’s name on it. But as Starmer pointed out this morning, the EEA amendment stood little chance either, because Labour MPs in Brexit-leaning constitutiencies were against. So what’s Labour up to?Politics. Corbyn has to try to square ardent remainers among his grassroots members – and indeed his parliamentary party – with his many MPs who have Leave constituencies, and believe appearing to be working towards overturning Brexit would be electorally suicidal. A version of the same argument has been playing out within the shadow cabinet, and in Corbyn’s inner circle – and the amendment is an attempt to nod at both camps. As much as anything else, it’s about party management – another example of Corbyn’s tendency to be more pragmatic than some of his fiercest critics give him credit for.But it’s also worth bearing in mind that part of the row about how fast to move, and when, has involved trying to avoid the appearance of being pushed by vocal backbenchers such as Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna, for whom there is no love lost in team Jeremy, to say the least.So will this make any difference to May’s position?At the margins, perhaps: with cabinet deadlocked over future customs arrangements and Whitehall seeking compromises, it matters what possible Brexit models could win the backing of parliament in the autumn.And what about the other amendments coming to parliament next week?The stickiest pair for the government are on strengthening the meaningful vote MPs will get after the Brexit negotiations are concluded in the autumn and the customs union.However, the Lords customs amendment doesn’t firmly commit the government to seeking to remain inside a customs union, so some at Westminster believe that while defeat would be humiliating, it would not force May and her ministers to change course immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b28dfa03695b491de108cc30d02e2d747e43100/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6f03c9aa7004438afc51653d3e4417e","title":"pmqs brexit starmer says labour wont back staying in eea because party too divided politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and David Davis’s Brexit speechThese are from the Times’ Sam Coates.Sajid Javid appears keen to make his own mark on the Home Office, and particularly when it comes to tone and language over immigration.In his first appearance as home secretary in the Commons he said he would not use the term “hostile environment” - a term used by Theresa May when she was home secretary (“the aim is to create ... a really hostile environment for illegal migration,” she told the  in 2012) but more recently dropped by the Home Office in place of the phrase “compliant environment”. Javid reiterated the point on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday.But it seems he wants to go further. Late last night, in response to a query about a letter sent by 20 MPs seeking action over scheme by which landlords are obliged to check the immigration status of prospective tenants, the Home Office sent a reply which repudiated the hostile environment idea in particularly strong terms. It read:The term ‘hostile environment’ as a description of Home Office immigration policy is incorrect, unhelpful and does not represent our values as a country.Of course, critics will say it is easy to change language – and the rest of the statement defends the actual policy concerned. But as a change in tone it is striking.Those Labour MPs who are opposed to staying fully in the single market after Brexit generally argue that this would not respect the result of the referendum, especially because being in the single market would mean the UK having to accept freedom of movement, and the government not being able to limit EU immigration.In an interview with BBC News, Sir Keir Starmer said that freedom of movement was something that Labour would be willing to negotiate with the EU as part of its plan to maintain full access to the single market. He said:Full access to the internal market means the benefits of the internal market, which has always been the Labour party position. Obviously that comes with obligations, and that’s why we’ve said it has to be underpinned by shared institutions and shared regulations.Free movement will have to be negotiated. Obviously we will have to set out what it is that we seek to achieve. The EU is obviously looking at free movement itself and it will be part the negotiation.Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, gave a speech yesterday suggesting a series of measures that could be introduced to curb EU immigration which he said were compatible with EU freedom of movement rules.The Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg was also on the Today programme this morning. Norway is in the EEA (European Economic Area) but not in the EU. Solberg, like other members of the Norwegian political class, is in favour of joining the EU, but the country has voted against the idea twice in referendums.She said that EEA membership was not ideal, because “the rules are still made in Brussels”, but she said that if a country had to be out of the EU, it was “difficult to find a better deal” than the EEA for businesses.Here are two comments from journalist on Labour’s position.This one, from my colleague Rafael Behr, has been retweeted by the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon (who doesn’t say “retweets are not endorsements” on her Twitter page.)And this is from Sky’s Lewis Goodall, who has a more positive take on Labour’s tactics.The Labour MP Wes Streeting suggests Keir Starmer is overstating the Labour opposition to staying in the EEA.Streeting has set out his arguments as to why Labour should back the EEA amendment in a Twitter thread starting here.Here is a summary of the main points from Sir Keir Starmer’s Today interview.He knows, and others who are critical on this know, that this amendment does not command that support in their own party. I’ve been talking to colleagues for the last two or three weeks to gauge the views across our party. I wish I could report that we had complete unity on all amendments but we are not in that position. The only way we can win a vote is if Labour is united and we all vote together in the same way at the same time. That’s how we can defeat the government .I’m determined that we are going to do that on the customs union, on the meaningful vote, on the Northern Ireland no hard border amendments last week, and I hope that we can have a whole catalogue of victories against the government. I actually think the government is going to have to concede in the face of the challenge.The customs union amendment only obliges the government to make a statement to parliament about the steps it has taken to keep the UK in the customs union (easy - “none”) and there is increasing speculation that the government will decide to accept this, on the grounds that it won’t change policy, rather than lose the vote. It could conceivably accept the Northern Ireland amendment too, which just says Brexit should not lead to a hard border with Ireland or undermine the Good Friday agreement, something the government says is policy already, although ministers fear having this written down could constrain their options. But the ‘meaningful vote’ amendment is genuinely significant it would ensure that a vote against the withdrawal agreement in the autumn would not automatically lead to the UK leaving the EU with no deal.What the EU negotiators have said time and time again is, if the red lines change, the prime minister’s red lines, there’s a different negotiation to be had. In my discussions with them, obviously in confidence, and I’m not going to betray that confidence, it is clear that what they mean by that is that, if we signal that we want a close economic relationship with the EU going forward, there is a conversation and negotiation to be had and it will involve some of the tools in the Norway-style toolbox. He also insisted that the ‘have cake and eat it’ criticism had been wrongly made of Labour policy before.When I first announced that we should have transitional measures on the same terms as now, which I did last summer, everybody said that’s just ‘cake and eat it’. It is now accepted as the only sensible basis for transition. When we set out our position on the customs union three or four months ago, everyone said, ‘Well, that’s cake and eat it.’ Now the government knows that if that proposition is going to be put to a vote, it’s going to lose it. So we will take this a little bit with a pinch of salt.Last night the Labour party announced that it was tabling amendments to three pieces of Brexit legislation (the EU withdrawal bill, the trade bill and the so-called customs bill) saying the government should seek to get full access to the EU single market after Brexit. Some saw this as the party moving closer towards making soft Brexit (in the sense of staying in the single market) an explicit aim. But other saw this as the Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn trying to buy off the pro-European majority in his party, and create a bit of cover ahead of a decision next week not to order Labour MPs to vote in favour of an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill committing the government to keeping the UK in the European Economic Area (EEA) - which would amount to proper single market membership.Here is our overnight story.And here are tweets from two of Labour’s most vocal pro-Europeans last night criticising the Labour move - partly on the grounds that Labour is not proposing full EEA membership, and partly on the grounds that Tory rebels are more likely to support the EEA amendment (a cross-party one from the Lords) than an amendment tabled in the name of Corbyn.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was on the Today programme this morning defending Labour’s move. His key argument was that, if Corbyn did order his MPs to back the EEA amendment, the party would split. Asked why the party was not backing it, he said:The difficulty with that, and I think everybody recognises this, is that there are very strong and very different views across the PLP on that particular amendment. So, whilst there’s unity on all the others and we will all be voting together, on that amendment there are very ided views.Asked if he was putting party unity before his beliefs about what is right for the country, he replied: I’m injecting some honesty about where we are in the Labour party.I will post more from the interview shortly.Here is the agenda for the day.8.45am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives a speech at the Policy Exchange thinktank.10.30am: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and the Conservative Anna Soubry speak at the launch of an Open Britain report on post-Brexit trade.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.1.30pm: May meets the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Downing Street.3pm: Alexander Nix, the former head of Cambridge Analytica, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee as part of its inquiry into fake news.3.15pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, gives evidence to the joint committee on human rights on the Windrush-era migrants.4pm: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, gives a speech on the UK’s vision for a security relationship with the EU after Brexit.As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

But as regards facing the Auld Enemy for the first time in four years, there is a healthy dose of respect and a quiet confidence that his players will not simply be providing an easy warm-up for England’s series with Australia.“Any time Scotland plays England, be it football, rugby or even cricket, it’s going to be a bit special,” says the former Durham batsman, who during the 2015 World Cup set the record for the highest score by an associate cricketer with a blistering 156 against Bangladesh.“This match is a fantastic reward for a lot of hard work and for the cricket-watching public here. To have the No 1 team in our backyard is incredible. Yes, they are a dangerous side but this is white-ball cricket and so there is an opportunity to do something special. It only takes one or two guys to take a game away and we have those players.”Coetzer is right. After all, it was only back in March that Scotland came within a whisker of reaching next summer’s criminally elite 10-team World Cup during the qualifiers in Zimbabwe, having looked set to book their place and knock out West Indies only to be denied by a combination of rain and questionable umpiring.Set 199 to win after a fine bowling performance in Harare, the Saltires were 125 for five from 35.2 overs when a deluge washed out the remainder of their final group match. With no reserve day scheduled, a five-run defeat via Duckworth-Lewis-Stern followed.Scottish cricketers know all about the elements, of course, but what stuck in the craw was the dismissal of Richie Berrington four overs before the rain, having been wrongly adjudged lbw for 33 without the opportunity to review. Had this fifth wicket not fallen and the run-rate stayed the same, Coetzer’s men would have gone through.“To be honest, I don’t know if I am over it,” says Coetzer. “Not reaching the World Cup saw Cricket Scotland miss out on around $700,000 (£525,000) too, which would have been huge for the sport, especially the grassroots. People make mistakes – players, umpires, anyone – but to not have the review system in a competition of that importance was … well … it just has to be there in future.”If this lack of technological help is one sore point – the official explanation given was that not every qualifier was televised – then the biggest perceived crime is having the 50-over format’s showpiece made up of so few teams, with Coetzer among a number of associate nation captains to highlight this folly.“You feel as if you are harping on about the same thing and getting nowhere,” he says. “Against West Indies it felt like whole world wanted us to win just to make a scene. And it’s not like we’re wanting a slice of the pie that’s unfair, just a situation that is for the betterment of the game as a whole – and that’s more than just a select few at the World Cup.”While missing out on the World Cup denied Scotland nine matches against the best teams – more than they get otherwise in a four-year cycle – and the make-up of the tournament beyond next year is yet to be decided, Aberdeen-born Coetzer is encouraged that they have now been added to the ICC one-day rankings, describing it as a “step in the right direction for globalising the sport”, as are the recent Test elevations for Ireland and Afghanistan.Sunday will mark his 50th one-day appearance – a source of personal pride – but, given that his debut came 10 years ago, it also highlights how few of their matches get official status and also the tug-of-war that can occur for those also involved in the county system the seamer Josh Davey, for example, missed the World Cup qualifiers due to a clash with Somerset’s pre-season.And the club versus country situation? “It’s a massive issue. I don’t want to speak out of turn but I know I faced huge challenges when I was with Durham. You have split loyalties you want to play for both. Your potential career lies with the county but there were occasions of immense pressure. I missed a game against Australia sitting on a team bus to Hove.”These are just some of the issues that face Scotland. But in the short term, at least, they have three juicy fixtures, with England’s visit followed by two T20 internationals against the world No 1 Pakistan. And if a couple of Scotland players go ape on the day, who knows?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/978694f52e2a1192b5decb46c15c4d3c6a85ec3f/0_0_3511_2107/master/3511.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00a0de687c38a727c045b1c97539d457","title":"siya kolisi interview south africa first black test captain england","story":"South Africa’s inspirational first black Test captain Siya Kolisi has the ability to bridge the country’s racial ideSiya Kolisi knows the meaning of what it truly is to suffer. As a small boy surviving in the township of Zwide near Port Elizabeth on South Africa’s east coast, he ate irregularly. His grandmother and young mother were unable to put food on the table every day. It was proper, aching hunger, something no child in the 21st century should have to experience.Kolisi’s mother, Phakama, was 16 when Siya was born his father, Fezakele, was in his final year of school. After giving birth to two more children from another relationship, Phakama died when Kolisi was 15 leaving his late grandmother, Nolulamile, to raise him.“Times were tough when I was little and often there wasn’t food. I would go to bed starving,” Kolisi says. “Sometimes we didn’t have enough money to pay my primary school fees, which were only R50 (£3) a year.”On Saturday, Kolisi will complete a remarkable journey from Zwide to the head of the players’ tunnel at Ellis Park, South Africa’s spiritual home of rugby. There, the proud Xhosa man with a smile as dazzling as his tackling is brutal, will become the first black captain to lead the Springboks in a Test in the series opener against England.There will be a certain serendipity in seeing Kolisi wearing the same No 6 jersey that the former president Nelson Mandela so famously donned at the 1995 World Cup final.Madiba’s appearance at Ellis Park 23 years ago, kitted in one of Springbok captain Francois Pienaar’s jerseys, lifted a nation, and for a brief period, united a country. Kolisi’s elevation to one of the most important jobs in South Africa has similarly given rugby a boost at a time when the Springboks embark on a new phase of – literally – changing the face of the national team.And Kolisi, a muscular 26-year-old openside flanker is going to drive that transformation from within because in many ways he is the aspirational post-apartheid South African.Rising from poverty to the pinnacle of a sport that until 1992 was the sporting embodiment of white minority rule, he has also legally adopted his two half siblings, married a white woman and is a loving dad to two mixed-race children. The rainbow nation could not have dreamed up a more perfect mentor to show South Africa how its complicated past can be overcome.“I don’t shy away from where I have come from and I’m aware that my story is a typical South African story in some ways. It’s my motivation,” Kolisi says. “Yes, being a professional sportsman can be tough and occasionally you question if it’s all worth it. But then I just think about where I’ve come from and about the people that look up to me. For me to be able to help people inspired by me, I have to play every week. That is my duty.“I’m not only trying to inspire black kids but people from all races. When I’m on the field and I look into the crowd, I see people of all races and social classes. We as players represent the whole country.“I tell my team-mates that you should never play just to represent one group. You can’t play to be the best black player or to be the best white player to appeal to a community you have to play to be the best for every South African. We represent something much bigger than we can imagine.”Kolisi was spotted at an under-12 tournament in Zwide and in a life-changing moment, offered a rugby scholarship to the prestigious Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, which produced cricket legend Graeme Pollock and England’s 2003 World Cup winner Mike Catt.Rugby was initially Kolisi’s best way of communicating while his academic studies suffered due to difficulties with speaking English. “There was a language barrier. I struggled with my academic work and I was scared to speak as a result,” Kolisi admits.“I would say one or two words in English and complete a sentence in Xhosa. But the guys were accepting and Nick Holton, who became a good friend, knew some Xhosa. So he helped me speak English and I helped him with his Xhosa. I knew him from rugby trials and we have been friends ever since.”Being on a sports scholarship might seem like a dream but it comes with pressure. The school expected Kolisi to put Grey rugby above all else, but he still yearned to play for a local Zwide amateur rugby club called African Bombers.It was forbidden in case of injury, but Kolisi could not resist sneaking in the odd game even though he played against men 10 years older. Inevitably, he ran into some trouble.“I injured my ankle playing for African Bombers at the end of the school season and it was so swollen that I couldn’t walk,” Kolisi says. “To hide it I had to stay in bed on the Monday. I eventually said that I injured it playing soccer in the street. I was out for three months.”Another time, the school first XV was scheduled to play in one of South Africa’s many Easter holiday schoolboy festivals. Kolisi wanted to go on his first trip to Europe after a friend’s family had offered to pay for him. He held off telling the rugby coach until the 11th hour, an unpopular move, but Kolisi remained steadfast that he wanted to see the world and not only play rugby.It is that determination and, latterly, an understanding of his role in society which has taken him to this point in his career.At 26, Kolisi has embraced professional and personal responsibility, usually expected of someone older. He spent 18 months going through a tough legal process to adopt his younger siblings, Liyema and Liphelo, who were in foster care in Zwide after his mother died.“In 2012 when I was in camp with the Boks, I went to Zwide to look for them because I hadn’t seen them in years,” Kolisi says.“I found a cousin who told me where my brother and sister were. They were at school at the time but I came back later and met them. You can imagine how emotional it was.“My little sister didn’t know me. She had been crawling when I last saw her. I told the woman taking care of them that I was going to take them for December holidays that year, which I did. But afterwards I said I can’t send them back.”“I had to go through a legal process, which I started after that holiday. It took about 18 months, but I finally legally adopted them.”Through it all, his now-wife Rachel and tight circle of friends, which includes Springbok hard man and 2017 captain Eben Etzebeth, have stood by his side.It is Rachel who provided the support and strength he needed to take on his challenging roles as an adoptive  to the siblings he hardly knew, captain of the Super Rugby franchise the Stormers, and of course, father to his own children Nicholas (named after Holton) and Keziah.“Spiritually I have grown a lot because my wife is a churchgoing person and she has guided me,” Kolisi says. “It was something I struggled with when I was younger.“Church and spirituality keeps me calm and peaceful and my family gives me great joy. When they are happy then I am happy. Rachel has been amazing because she took all of this on and taken some racial abuse on social media, which isn’t easy.“Honestly it doesn’t affect me because I know what we have is real, how much she means to me and how much she means to our family. Also, things at home have forced me to be a better man and a role model. I want to set a positive example – I want to be my kids’ hero and an inspiration for all South Africans.”The bond Kolisi shares with Etzebeth underlines his inclusive nature and ability to straddle the racial ide in South Africa. He brings people on either side closer together.The pair could not have come from more disparate backgrounds with Etzebeth raised in Cape Town’s blue collar, white, conservative northern suburbs.As with his Grey schoolmates, Kolisi could hardly speak Afrikaans and Etzebeth could barely speak English. But they shared a love of rugby and found mutual respect as people.“For us, it was just normal and our genuine friendship has opened the eyes of many people to understanding that you need to see people for who they are because this is the essence of South Africa.“I don’t think of myself in racial terms. When I walk out on the field I want to be the best flanker in the world. If you think in racial terms, you are limiting yourself and your horizons.“Even though I’m black, I touch and inspire many people from all races. As rugby players we have a beautiful platform to showcase what being a South African could be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b5e671f80b62ce0a8c34dbb13b1435ef2739a1e/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ebfaf123c3bfb2c4ed1b8848167d29e","title":"state of origin 2018 game i new south wales blues v queensland maroons live","story":"In the commentary booth Darren Lockyer says Qld would have been relieved NSW took the two.

I suspect they will.Oh alright then, here they are for real — although that bloke on the right could be league reporting legend Steve Mascord.Electronic duo Peking Duk have just cranked out a number on stage (that could be worded better) but I can’t say I paid much attention. I could show my age and ignorance by saying ‘Pekinhg Duk? Never heard of them!’ but I won’t.NSW, as you’ve heard, have 11 on debut, the most in an Origin team (excepting 1995 when the ARL excluded Super League players) since the NSW Game 3 side in 1994.As such no-one in the team has played in a series winning match (Boyd Cordner only played game 3 in 2014, a game NSW lost after winning games one and two).The player I’m most delighted to see picked is Josh Addo-Carr. NSW Origin teams have shown in the past they are reluctant to pick (relatively) svelte wingers, and I recall here the scandal of Nathan Blacklock never winning Blues berth. So all speed to the fastest man on the pitch tonight.I know it’s gimmicky but I love the real-time info emanating from the tracking devices the players wear these days:Excitement is building in the ’G which will host its fifth Origin match, with the Blues holding a 3-1 advantage. The last time Origin came to Melbourne was for game two in 2015, a thriller won by NSW: The first time was in 1990 – though this video makes it seem like 1890:NSW walked, Qld got the bus. Lazy buggers.There was plenty of talk this week that Ben Hunt and Dane Gagai were struggling with injury. Was it a classic game of ducks and drakes, par for the course for the Maroons who will happily walk backwards from the centre of a room so they can say they have their backs against the wall? Was it legit?Whatever your take, both have been named as starters tonight. As expected, Michael Morgan goes to fullback in place of the injured Slater, while there is no room, even on the bench, for the dynamic Kalyn Ponga.For all the talk of major absences in the Qld team the Maroons have plenty of talent still on show, not least Inglis, Hunt, Morgan, Val Holmes and last year’s game 3 star, Cameron Munster.NSW, by contrast, are a team picked on both form (eight players from the ladder-leading Dragons and Panthers) and promise, and they certainly look capable of winning tonight despite having just 39 caps between them.As mentioned, there are 11 debutants on show: Tom Trbojevic, Latrell Mitchell, James Roberts, Josh Addo-Carr, Nathan Cleary, Damien Cook, Reagan Campbell-Gillard, Jack de Belin, Paul Vaughan, Angus Crichton, and Tyrone Peachey. The Blues have turned green by walking to the ground tonight. (Did they forget their Myki cards?) This would have put them within heckling distance of all the Qld fans making their way to the MCG. Not quite like walking down Caxton St towards Lang Park but potentially unsettling all the same. Brad Fittler must have weighed up whether the exercise could backfire and put extra jitters into his team of fledglings. Apart from 2014, which turned out to be the eye of the storm, Queensland has, since 2006, torn through State of Origin like a cyclone. Eleven of the past 12 series have been won by the Queenslanders, in no small part because, blessed by providence (and, quite possibly, the power of pineapples), the Maroons have had at their disposal a collection of modern greats all peaking at the same time: Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Billy Slater and Greg Inglis.If there was any consolation for long-suffering NSW fans – who have had to huddle in their cellars for so long with their tinned food, army-cots and chamber pots that they’ve forgotten what happiness feels like – it was that one day time would catch up on the greats and the storm would pass that one blessed day they could swing open the cellar doors, feel the sun on their faces again and look up at the sky and see blue. Only blue.With game one of the 2018 Origin series about to kick off it seems a reasonable time to wonder if that day is suddenly upon us.Change was in the air after the 2017 series when Thurston and Cronk (37 and 22 Queensland caps respectively) called it a day. Then, just weeks ago, Smith (40 caps, and perhaps the chief architect of NSW’s misery) surprised everyone by suddenly retiring from rep footy. If that wasn’t fortuitous enough for NSW, Slater (29 caps), this week succumbed to a hamstring injury, having already announced 2018 would be his last in maroon.Not since 2003 has Queensland been without at least one of these players. Throw in the dropped Darius Boyd (28 caps) and Matt Scott (22) and, even though Greg Inglis (30 caps) is still there, it’s a relatively inexperienced Queensland side coach Kevin Walters will send out onto the MCG turf tonight.Of course, intriguingly, an even more inexperienced NSW side will face them. New coach Brad Fittler has seemingly drawn a line through a number of players who have ‘been there, lost that’ for NSW over the years. It’s as if Fittler remembered that pop jargon definition of insanity: “Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”In any case, Fittler, who had much success wearing the Blues jersey himself, figured a fresh start was needed and he has recruited an incredible 11 Origin debutants, men who aren’t mentally scarred by the Maroons. Callow they may be but they are also young, fast, imposing and, you’d think, optimistic that they can begin to end, once and for all, this incredible Queensland era.Of course, history may show that while the old Queensland era ends tonight – a new one will begin. It’s an intriguing scenario and I truly don’t know what to expect tonight. If I HAD to make a prediction it would be NSW by eight, which pretty much guarantees a Queensland win.Good to have your company for what should be a cracker of a match. Kick-off: 8pm-ish local. Oh, I should of course mention that I’d love to hear your thoughts and predictions on the game tonight.

Selling real estate while black. Moving in while black. Napping while black. Working out while black.Ever since a Starbucks in the Philadelphia area came under national scrutiny for calling the police on two black men waiting for a business associate in one of the company’s coffee shops, new attention has been focused on the long list of mundane activities that black Americans can’t confidently engage in without being treated as suspicious or having the police called.“It’s just part of daily living. It’s what you expect as a person of color when you head out the door in the morning,” said Jeff Chang, the author of Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America. “A moment like this just sort of galvanized folks to be able to express all the different ways in which they’ve been impacted by daily racism.”In many ways the newly energized conversation parallels how Black Lives Matter emerged as an ideological clearinghouse for the problem of racialized police violence several years ago. Neither phenomenon was new, but in both cases a stream of high profile incidents managed to snowball into its own trope, in part thanks to social media and smartphone videos. In this case that’s the trope of “everyday racism”. For experts, the genesis is clear. While the US has ended the formal, legal codes of enslavement and segregation that stood for most of the nation’s history, little has been done to change the minds of too many about the racist ideas that those structures rested on. “There has not been a society-wide and intensive challenge to racist ideas in the US,” said Ibram Kendi, the director of the Antiracist Research \u0026amp Policy Center at American University. “You’ve had people saying we need to have ‘national conversations’, You’ve have people calling for ‘healing’, because in their minds it’s just that people are hateful and they need to start loving ... But in terms of a national, widespread effort to reorient Americans’ racist ideas – that has never happened before.”And those ideas run deep, said Jamilah Lemieux, a cultural critic and writer. “Non-black people in this country have been fed a steady diet of propaganda from their parents, their schools, their churches, and from the media that tells them that people of color, and particularly black folks and Latinx people are not to be trusted.“They’ve been taught that we are criminals, that we are violent that we are predators and think we need to be monitored.” Barack Obama’s 2008 election was seen by much of white America as the dawning of a new, post-racial age. The logic held that, if a black man could attain the highest office in the land, then no goal could be considered out of reach for an inidual black person in modern America. This post-racial framing, of course, belies not just the inherited and institutional disadvantages black Americans face in housing, education, wealth, and other socioeconomic concerns, but also the emergence of what some have described as a “newer, slicker” form of racism. After the 2008 election, the anti-racist activist and writer Tim Wise described it as one where whites “hold the larger black community in low regard” but “carve out acceptable space for iniduals like Obama who strike them as different”.And insofar as Obama’s eight years in power fueled a renewed sense of purpose and organization among white nationalists, and triggered what the CNN pundit Van Jones famously described as a “whitelash”, some, including Obama himself, have wondered if his presidency actually set the project of racial equality back – at least temporarily. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Obama worried aloud to an aide shortly after the election, according to a forthcoming book. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”That racial tribalism is part of what propelled Trump’s victory, despite the fact that he would go on to repeatedly describe himself as the “least racist person”. Trump’s popularity with unabashed white supremacists stems from his frequent ill-informed tweets and comments about inner city violence, and his reported use of the the phrase “shithole counties” in speaking about immigrants from black and brown nations.After the Starbucks incident, numerous other examples quickly emerged via news reports and social media. In New Jersey, two black men had police called on them by staff at a gym after being falsely accused of working out without proper memberships. Police in California swarmed three black women leaving an Airbnb when a neighbor concluded they were in the midst of a robbery. A woman in Oakland called the police on black residents for barbecuing in a park, and, at Yale University, a white woman called police on a black fellow student for falling asleep in a dorm common area.The presence of police is not the defining factor for everyday racism, or what some call “microaggressions”, but it is one of the harshest escalations. For Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing and the president of the Center for Policing Equity, part of this has to do with the fact that black people often share space in places like a university campus or a rapidly gentrifying city such as Oakland, California, but don’t always share bonds. “When you have people living close to each other who are not in community with each other, that breeds fear,” Goff said.He worries about what it means that in cases where officers functionally become “deputized as a kind of personal racism valet” – armed respondents to unfounded suspicions by white Americans. But from the perspective of law enforcement it’s a hard circle to square.“You can’t very well instruct your 911 operators to be like ‘yeah Mrs Smith, I know you said there were gangbangers but we know you’re probably just racist,” Goff said. Police have to respond, and are trained to treat every scenario as though it could become dangerous. “So they’re going to show up, and they’re generally going to be aggressive,” Goff added. “And by the time they figure out that you are not the issue, your dignity has been so assaulted that it really is difficult to have a pleasant conversation. For the cops and for the resident.”Thus, more than anything, what needs to be challenged to make real progress on everyday racism is racial bias, whether conscious or unconscious. “The only way we actually win, is to change the social norms,” Goff said.And for Kendi, like many race scholars, an important part of that is paying closer attention to social, economic and political policies that have a biased impact, rather than case by case negative exchanges iniduals have with one another. “Policies are the cradle of the racist ideas circulating in people’s minds that are leading to those interpersonal situations that are negatively affecting people,” Kendi said.“If people are really serious about being able to live freely and black in the United States, then the way really to do that is to be a part of the movement against racist policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74cd3d6aaff41ac8eeaef68e6bb624dc0817bfb4/216_463_4784_2870/master/4784.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62cf8f2bf121a90e28c5d34245a51687","title":"us china relations deteriorating fast taiwan trade","story":"Clashes over South China Sea, Taiwan and trade have plunged Trump and Xi into the diplomatic deep freezeChina’s expanding efforts to impose its will on neighbours through diplomatic, commercial and military pressure – the so-called Xi doctrine – have drawn the sharpest riposte to date from the Trump administration, with Taiwan once again the main flashpoint in a sea of accelerating Sino-American rivalry.Following recent verbal clashes over US “freedom of navigation” patrols in disputed South China Sea waters, officials in Washington say they plan to send a US aircraft carrier battlegroup into the Taiwan Strait separating the island from mainland China. The move was in response to China’s military “turning up the heat” on Taiwan, an official said. Such a US deployment, if it goes ahead, would be seen as highly provocative by China’s president, Xi Jinping, who has vowed to reunify China with its “renegade province” in his lifetime. It would potentially bring the US navy into contact with Chinese surface and submarine forces and hundreds of People’s Liberation Army missile batteries lining the shores of the strait. Xi warned Taiwan’s pro-independence government in March that it would face the “punishment of history” if it pursued a separatist course.On Tuesday, a foreign ministry spokeswoman cautioned Washington not to jeopardise peace. “We have repeatedly emphasised that the Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive core issue in the China-US relationship,” she said. Although the US does not recognise Taiwan as an independent country, it is, to all intents and purposes, its principal defender and guarantor against attack. Donald Trump outraged Beijing after he was elected by talking directly to Taiwan’s president by phone. Washington has sold Taiwan more than $15bn (£11.2bn) in arms since 2010, and Trump has increased bilateral contacts, including with the Pentagon.The US response is being closely watched for signs of weakness by America’s other allies in the region, who are also feeling the squeeze. Australia’s government strongly protested this week at Chinese pressure on Qantas to list Taiwan as Chinese territory on its website. Australia is already involved in disputes with Beijing over alleged covert meddling by China in its internal political affairs. Similar allegations of Chinese interference have surfaced in New Zealand.Rodrigo Duterte, the volatile Philippines president, recently became so upset about Chinese encroachment on South China Sea islands claimed by Manila (which refers to the area as the West Philippines Sea) that he threatened to declare war. That led Vietnam, which has its own disputes with Beijing, to call for calm.Dangerous US-China flashpoint issues appear to be multiplying fast. The two superpowers are locked in a worsening trade dispute. China took furious exception to American and Taiwanese comments about this week’s anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators. It flatly rejects criticism of its repression of similar sentiments in Hong Kong.Now the US and China may also be heading for a collision over Trump’s attempts to cut a denuclearisation-for-normalisation deal with North Korea at a summit next week. China may greatly benefit from an end to sanctions. But if Pyongyang comes in from the cold, Beijing could catch a strategic chill. Speaking in Singapore at the weekend, James Mattis, the US defence secretary, had a tough message for China, indicating how far relations have deteriorated since Trump visited Beijing last year. “We have seen those who wanted to dominate the region come and go, and we have been with you,” Mattis told America’s allies. China would ultimately pay a heavy price for bullying its neighbours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812bcacb6cb5c0502a6cea36a40b99cace44f5/0_169_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53481d7d953817363830406c0e81532c","title":"all eyes on canada as first g7 nation prepares to make marijuana legal","story":"From crime to health to business, Canada’s decision to legalize marijuana is a grand progressive experiment that promises to answer a host of questionsWhen Canopy Growth opened its first cannabis factory in an old chocolate plant near Ottawa four years ago, it did so predicting a bright future. Canada had already legalized medical marijuana, and Canopy predicted full legalization for recreational use to be next.What the company hadn’t predicted, however, was the sudden flood of foreign visitors. Politicians and police authorities from Jamaica, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece and Australia have all come knocking, as well as doctors from New Zealand, Brazil and Chile, along with groups of corporate investors and bankers – so many that Canopy now splits the groups into smaller units according to their birthdays.“We knew we’d have to give a lot of tours, so we just cut a window into the wall,” said the company spokesman, Jordan Sinclair. “We put windows in all of the doors.” Canada will be thrust even more directly under the international microscope on Thursday, when a vote in the Senate is expected to ratify Bill C-45, effectively making Canada the first G20 nation to legalize recreational marijuana.“It’s going to be a bit of a science fiction experience for a while,” said Benedikt Fischer, an expert on substance use at Toronto’s biggest psychiatric hospital. “It’s unique in the world, because it’s happening for the first time in a wealthy country. It’s not like in the US, where there are these state experiments. Most people kind of ignore Uruguay. And so the world is really looking at this.”Governments, researchers and business leaders around the world all have their own reasons for keeping tabs. Legalization could affect Canada’s crime patterns, health and countless other factors – but exactly how, no one yet knows. Each Canadian province plans to roll out its newly legalized market in a slightly different way, creating about a dozen mini-laboratories within one massive test case.Even places that have already taken the legalization plunge are hoping Canada will solve some mysteries. After Colorado legalized marijuana five years ago, for example, organized crime reacted by ramping up supplies of “black tar heroin, opiates and harder drugs”, said Dr Larry Wolk, the state’s top public health official.But Wolk says he is interested to watch that process unfold on a bigger scale in Canada, where the new law is expected to deal a much more significant blow to the black market. Any new mix of illicit drugs in the country could have new effects on public health.One delicate balance for Canadian authorities has been guessing at what kind of pricing will be low enough to eradicate illicit sales – yet not so low as to entice new users. Canada’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, recently said the goal is “keeping cannabis out of the hands of kids and out of the black market. That means keeping the taxes low so we can actually get rid of the criminals in the system”.One sign of success will be if Canada not only discourages underground sales, but converts illicit sellers to the new system, said Tim Boekhout van Solinge, a Dutch criminologist.“What I am mainly following … is who will be the new legal growers, and whether authorities manage to get some of the illegal growers to become legal growers,” he said.Each country around the world that has debated whether to relax cannabis laws has had its own priority in mind: from generating revenue to discouraging drug cartels. In Canada, the emphasis has been largely on public health. Cannabis will be sold in fairly plain packaging, and usually through government-run liquor stores.“It won’t be like buying Budweiser or branded alcoholic products,” said Steve Rolles of Transform, a UK drug policy thinktank. “It’s going to be more like buying pharmaceuticals from a chemist.”Still, it’s hard to know whether Canada, or any similar western country, will be able to stick to that public-health focus, he said.“We have concerns … that the lessons from alcohol and tobacco wouldn’t be learned, and we might see overcommercialized markets in which profit-making entities would seek to encourage more use and could encourage risky consumption behaviours,” he said.So far, Canada has allowed a few major players to dominate the industry, and their influence remains to be seen, said US marijuana industry expert Mark Kleiman.“You don’t want to build up big vested interests that then resist any change,” he said. “If you have commercial industry in cannabis, they’re going to end up writing the laws.”For epidemiologists, Canada will provide the best-ever data sets on cannabis use.Colorado’s health results have been encouraging, said Wolk. But overall, researchers lack solid data about cannabis use. Some key questions include addiction levels, how cannabis affects psychotic disorders, and effects on young people, said Israeli scientist Raphael Mechoulam, often called the “grandfather” of cannabis research.Another current Canadian health debate is how many people will be light, casual cannabis users, and how many will be heavy users.The government still must decide how to approach products that are “very potent” in THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, said Mark Ware, a drug researcher and pain specialist who helped lead Canada’s federal taskforce advising the new legislation. Black-market sellers have produced increasingly strong concentrates, he said.“Those have not been the subject of studies up until recently, so the question of whether to regulate those, allow them in whatever context, and then be able to study their impacts on health, that would be very important,” he said. But “once they’re out there, it’s very hard to put them back in the box again”.Meanwhile, many investors have already made huge profits from cannabis stocks, and a big question for them is whether the bubble bursts – or the value keeps rising.“They’re waiting to see if the sky’s going to fall,” said Sinclair of Canopy.

Damian Le Bas turns the key again. And again. After the eighth attempt, the engine rattles into life. “Thank fuck,” he exhales.Le Bas, 33, a writer and film-maker, is unusually relieved because the van has been his companion for thousands of miles while exploring Britain’s “stopping places” – the sites where Travellers traditionally pulled over – and the journey has become the subject of his first book. But his relief may also be partly because the Transit is one emblem of modern male Traveller identity, and he is alive to accusations that he is somehow not a real Gypsy. It has been suggested that Le Bas, who went to boarding school and Oxford University, is merely a hipster with a van.“A publisher asked: ‘Aren’t you just some really middle-class guy who happens to have a Traveller background?” says Le Bas. “He was implying that because I’m educated, I’m inauthentic. That is not a fantastic thing to say – that you can be educated out of your ethnicity. You can’t be educated out of being a Jamaican.”Le Bas is wearily familiar with the casual racism towards the ethnic minority of Gypsies and Travellers. As the former editor of the Travellers’ Times, he devoted himself to defending the different Roma communities, particularly after news stories about Gypsy criminality or disputes when Travellers settled in villages. He found this “exhausting and demoralising”, and wanted to explore both his own roots and the history of Gypsies in Britain, so his road trip began.Life on the road was a novel experience for Le Bas because, like many contemporary Travellers, he grew up “settled”, just outside Hove. “It was a typical Travellers’ yard in that there was an antagonistic relationship with the local authority. They had distributed flyers prior to my family moving up there saying: ‘Stop the Gypsies moving in.’” Le Bas spent his early childhood in houses, mobile homes and caravans (“trailers”) with his extended family, including his mother and father, who were both artists, and his nan – great-grandmother Julie Jones, who is 91. We meet at her house in Worthing, and she listens with interest as we talk in her front room.When Le Bas was 11, he won a life-changing scholarship to Christ’s Hospital, a boarding school in West Sussex. “My grandfather was very against the idea of me going to this weird school where who knew what I’d be exposed to. When I was homesick, my dad just wanted to pull me out. My mum stuck to her guns. It was very hard and upsetting for her but she thought if I went to a local school I might end up in trouble.” What did his nan think? “I cried when he went but it was a good thing,” says Jones. Was his family worried Le Bas would abandon Gypsy traditions? “No,” she says. “I thought of him being safe there and doing good for himself.”Le Bas didn’t feel safe enough at boarding school to reveal his background to any pupils except for two of his closest friends. “And also I wasn’t sure what it was. A lot of my family are true Romany Gypsies but I didn’t know where I fitted in to all that. I felt like I belonged to something but Travellers aren’t always so sure.” Although Le Bas speaks Romany, there were non-Gypsy relatives on both sides of his family tree. “A lot of Travellers draw a hard line between Gypsies and gorjies, non-Travellers, and I’ve got both in me.”Le Bas went on to Oxford, where he studied Hebrew and Greek as part of his theology degree. How many Gypsy students did he know? “I’ve never met another Traveller who has been to Oxbridge,” he says. Even though Le Bas was an exception at university, he grew more confident about his identity and challenged his peers’ racism. His education made him an exception among Travellers, too: he didn’t marry until he was 26 (his wife is the actor Candis Nergaard), unlike his mum who was married at 19, and he acquired an unplaceable accent, not at all plummy but with a Kentish inflection that sounds older than his years.It would be easy for The Stopping Places to be an angry rant, but Le Bas consciously “killed my old journalistic self” and tried to “eschew romanticism and angry activism” to write an elegiac contemporary travelogue. The book is also distinctive for being arguably the first literary exploration of Anglo-Romany culture by a Traveller. Serious studies of Gypsy culture are mostly the preserve of non-Gypsy academics (with a couple of exceptions in the United States). “It has been a monopoly of non-Gypsies for ever, to be honest,” says Le Bas. The book was also a more personal challenge: “I wanted to test the idea of being ‘a lesser son of greater sires’, a phrase from Tolkien,” he says. “It’s not easy growing up with stories of Nan’s father, who could weave a basket from reeds that could hold water. And master horses and heal people with herbalism. That’s how skilled he was. What can I do? I spent my childhood playing a Game Boy and riding a BMX.”But Le Bas soon becomes more comfortable in his own skin, and on the road. It changes his perception of time, he’s more aware of nature (“I’m not saying I’m some kind of horse whisperer but I’d be a little bit more attuned to what animals were doing”) and realises the starkness of the distinction between summer and winter. “Summer is really nice and winter is really horrible,” he says. Mud besmirches his van’s tiny, neat living space. “You’re hemmed in by rain for days. And if you’ve got washing to dry, it’s hard. Don’t ask me – Nan lived it.”During his travels, he developed a conviction that we should recognise a Romany geography. One stopping place, Messenger’s Meadow, had a sign instructing people not to disturb the soil because of Roman remains. “If there are Roman remains in the soil and we shouldn’t disturb them, we might want to think about the Gypsy remains at old stopping places. Roadside burials used to be common when people couldn’t afford a formal internment.” Not only are historic stopping places unheralded, but they are often barred by bollards or bunds of earth to stop their use today. Le Bas only knows one common in southern England on to which Gypsies can still freely drive. Nearly a decade ago, there were a series of conflicts when Travellers bought land and “settled” in rural villages. “People always point out: ‘They are Travellers, they should travel,’” he says. “It’s not the travel that’s the problem, it’s the stopping.”Is intolerance towards Travellers growing? “It has been pretty bad in the past,” he says. “At the minute, they are not hanging Gypsies for being Gypsies in England.” Le Bas writes about the case of Francis Buckley, a 16-year-old Gypsy boy from Islington who was arrested, tried and hanged, bizarrely, for impersonating a Gypsy – “counterfeiting himself to be an Egyptian”. Romany people, Le Bas argues, are “permanently trapped” in “the pincer of demonisation and romanticisation”. He dates the rise of anti-Gypsy prejudice to the birth of the nation state. “The nomad presented a problem to the nation state in terms of collecting taxes, because they had no fixed address. But there is also fear of a group that is perceived to be clannish and apart in some way. Many of these prejudices are very similar to antisemitic prejudices, and they are not really about nomadism. They are about a group that exists simultaneously within and outside European society. You can’t disregard pure racism as being a factor.”Now the internet amplifies hate, says Le Bas, and the mainstream media doesn’t help. At the Travellers’ Times he tackled the fallout from the Channel 4 series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. “It did an awful lot of damage, not just to Travellers, but to people who made the programme and the people who consumed it.” He’s still enraged by its “colonial tone” and the myths it propagated, such as that there is a tradition of “grabbing” young women. “That was some teenagers in a car park outside Staines bragging about their exploits and they inferred that this was a cultural practice with deep roots, which is absolute rubbish.”For all his determination to challenge prejudice, Le Bas does not seek to “represent” his people. “In so many ways I’m the least representative person you can think of,” he says. Besides, Travellers do not want to be represented. “There is no Board of British Romanies, nor is there likely to be. But I felt I had a responsibility as a thinking citizen as much as a Traveller to challenge this deeply unsatisfactory media narrative, which lacks nuance and colour. It’s just so boring and repetitive and unfair.” That narrative focuses on criminal or antisocial behaviour. “Journalists can’t report on an absence of criminality, on an absence of rubbish, because there’s nothing to report on, and so those who behave badly monopolise the coverage,” says Le Bas.In the future, Le Bas hopes he might articulate his culture through fiction but he also wants to defend the Romany language, which still has no official recognition in British law. “I worry that kids aren’t learning the language to the same level,” he says. “A view of the world can live within a language and be lost with it.”And what does Nan think? “It’s good,” says Jones. “I tell him, if he wants to do it, get on with it. You can’t live your life for other people. You’ve got to do what you want to do, what you think is right.”Le Bas smiles. “You see, Nan just sums it up better.”The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas is published on 7 June by Chatto \u0026amp Windus, priced £14.99.

Luckily for him, that is the point. For the past four years Watson, who lives in the tiny New Zealand township of Te Aroha, has been broadcasting to the world. But instead of seeking an engaged listenership, Watson wants those who tune into his station to literally fall asleep. And they do.People from as far away as Afghanistan, Israel, Russia, Hungary, Taiwan and Puerto Rico log on to Watson’s station Sleep Radio. Someone in Prague has been listening for three days straight.The idea of a radio station that sends listeners to sleep came to Watson after he had a heart attack 10 years ago. Following five coronary artery bypasses he began to suffer from chronic depression and insomnia.“I never used to have trouble going to sleep but now I was lying awake watching the sun rise and feeling like a zombie,” he said.Watson, 62, was treated with medication and started seeing a counsellor who suggested he try relaxing, ambient music to help him sleep. Soon he found there was not a lot out there for sleep music aficionados.“Even on the radio you would be listening to relaxing music, trying to get to sleep and, all of a sudden, an advert would come on, yelling at you to buy something.”Watson thought he could do better. He did his research, looking into royalty-free ambient music and taught himself how to set up a digital radio station. Sleep Radio was born.He said the project is a “hobby and a passion”. He often gets grateful listeners emailing him with their success stories, including a mother whose newborn baby is also seemingly a fan. However, Watson is quick to say that ambient music does not work for everyone. His wife, for example, finds it too boring. Sleep Radio has now expanded into an app that allows people to set a timer for their listening. Meanwhile Watson has not had to source new music for over a year. There are ambient music producers lining up to have people fall asleep to their material. However there are rules – no vocals, no piano, guitar or harp solos, and absolutely no ocean sounds or birdsong.“I’m amazed at how many artists happily contribute,” says Watson. “The ambient music genre isn’t that popular so any airplay they can get is good for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"couples with children view their lives when young and single as happiest","story":"People over the age of 60 were at their happiest when married with young children while those who may be currently married with young children believe the most joy-filled stage of their lives was when they were young and single, according to a survey published on Wednesday morning. The 13th annual Pfizer Health Index charts the health perceptions and behaviours of Irish adults and this year it points to substantial differences between how various age groups view their own health.It ided adults into three distinct categories – those aged between 20 and 39, 40 and 60, and 61 and older and asked a range of health-related questions such as what illnesses concerned people most, what steps they felt they could take for the benefit of their future health, and what significant “life milestones” have had the most impact on how they approach their health.When assessing difference in attitudes, it found illness concerns vary substantially with adults aged between 20 and 39 most likely to worry about mental health, diabetes and obesity while heart disease, cholesterol and arthritis feature relatively more among those aged between 40 and 60. Adults over 60 told researchers they were most concerned about cancer and Alzheimer’s.Along with health concerns, health priorities also shift with age with the youngest group more focused on appearance with diet and exercise ranking as their top health priorities. In middle age reducing consumption of alcohol becomes the main priority while disease prevention ranks as number one among those over 60.More exercise and a better diet were widely recognised as being the key steps to take for better health in later life, with younger adults also identifying issues and solutions that impact on mental health as a high priority for future good health.There was also consistent agreement across the ages that if they could go back to an earlier point in their life with 56 per cent of those polled saying they would exercise more and 53 per cent claiming they would have a better diet if given the chance to live their lives all over again. Being calmer, not smoking and going to the dentist more also featured prominently as things people would modify if given the chance. “Starting to feel old” was the most transformative life experience that affects how people of all ages approach their health with 37 per cent of those polled agreeing with this statement.Men were more likely to describe feeling old as having the most profound impact on how they view their future health while the arrival of a child has more of an impact on women. Most people surveyed told pollsters that their happiest life stage was when they were young and single although a majority of those over 60 said being “married with children” was their happiest time.The Pfizer Health Index is a national study of health and wellness, and focuses on attitudes and perception of health, disease incidence, illness experience and impact, health funding, interaction with medical services and levels of health insurance, among other areas. All told, 69 per cent of those surveyed rated their health as 7 out of 10 or higher although only 6 per cent gave themselves a perfect 10. People continue to believe the health should remain the Government’s top priority with 62 per cent of those polled expressing the view that it was of paramount importance, a long way ahead of education which was on 12 per cent and job creation on 11 per cent. Finance is now listened as the issue which most people are prioritising with 32 per cent giving it the highest ranking up from 16 per cent last year. In the past, family and personal health were the top concerns listed.Engagement with the medical professions appears high with 39 per cent of those surveyed saying they had visited their GP in the last three months for a check-up while 32 per cent visited a doctor as they were unwell.The survey also assessed engagement with screening programmes and found that 48 per cent of women and 57 per cent of all adults over 50 surveyed have been involved in a national screening programme this year.“This is the 13th year that we have undertaken this research, during this time period we have gone from boom to bust and now we are emerging from a tough recessionary period with strong economic growth and a bright future,” Pfizer Ireland managing director Paul Reid said. He said the current situation “presents a new set of challenges for public policy and government strategies” as life expectancy increases. Prof Charles Normand, Professor of Health Policy and Management in Trinity College Dublin. said starting to feel old was “certainly a life experience the vast majority of us can expect to go through, and we need to start looking after our health now to ensure we remain healthy in older age for as long as possible.”He described as “encouraging” the finding that the 60 plus cohort “are cognisant of maintaining their health” and said “we need to look after this age group in our health service and ensure younger generations are as educated about the importance of health maintenance as possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521018.1528272551!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wait is over for 120 000 students as exams begin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe examinations run until Wednesday 20th June for Junior CertificateCycle subjects and Friday 22nd June for Leaving Certificate subjects. Exams are under way this morning as more than 120,000 students start more than two weeks of Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations.Examinations in 91 subjects, including those at higher, ordinary and foundation levels, will take place in 5,223 exam centres. Examination centres have also been established in 13 prisons and other places of detention to facilitate prisoners sitting exams. According to figures supplied by the State Examination Commission (SEC), 55,770 students are expected to sit the Leaving Cert this year while almost 62,000 students are due to sit exams at Junior level.Some 4 million examination papers have been distributed to examination superintendents involved in supervising the written examinations.This year, students in 41 schools will will sit a new examination paper in Politics and Society for the first time, following the introduction of the subject on a phased basis in September 2016.Students are tested with a written exam accounting for the majority (80 per cent) of points while a citizenship project accounts for 20 per cent of the final marks.Leaving Certificate candidates may also undertake examinations in one non-curricular language subject and this year, just over 1,600 students will sit an in one of 18 languages. The non-curricular languages include Polish, modern Greek, Danish and, for the first time, Maltese.Oral tests in Leaving Certificate language subjects were conducted in the two week period between Monday 9th and Friday 20th April, along with the practical tests in Leaving and Junior Certificate Music and Junior Certificate Home Economics.The examinations run until Wednesday 20th June for Junior CertificateCycle subjects and Friday 22nd June for Leaving Certificate subjects. Yesterday, Minister for Education and Skills Richard Bruton sent his best wishes to students, who, he said, “should be very proud” after putting in “a huge effort to get to this point”. Mr Bruton pointed out that there are multiple pathways now in place for students to realise their ambitions.“As well as higher and further education courses, we now have a very broad range of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes available, in very exciting new areas, such as ICT and financial services, as well as the traditional craft courses. “These are very attractive options that lead to very rewarding careers, when considering your next steps,” he said. Mr Bruton also paid tribute to teachers, principals and parents for supporting their students prepare for these exams. We are very fortunate in Ireland to have such a dedicated and committed teaching profession. “Teachers and school leaders have a transformative impact on a child’s life and make an invaluable contribution to our society. Thank you for your efforts again this year and the best of luck again, to all students sitting the state exams,” he said.The examinations run until Wednesday 20th June for Junior CertificateCycle subjects and Friday 22nd June for Leaving Certificate subjects. The written examinations in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme finish on Thursday 14th June. Clive Byrne, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, pointed out the importance of rest.“The Leaving Cert is an immensely stressful time. While you should be working hard, you shouldn’t be pushing yourself to the edge of a nervous breakdown. You need to be calm and collected on the day. “You won’t be productive if you study for twelve hours straight, locked away like a monk in a cell. Take regular breaks and reward your work by doing something that you enjoy. Listen to music, go for a walk, and talk to your friends and family.” he said.ASTI president Ger Curtin urged students to keep things in perspective over the coming weeks: “While some level of anxiety is completely normal, it’s really important that you keep things in perspective. Exams are just one small aspect of life. They are not everything. It is much more important to focus on how you are, rather than how you are performing, over the coming weeks. Eat well, get plenty of rest, take exercise, build in relaxation time, organise yourself so that you have everything you need each day and so that you are not rushing to get to an exam in time,” he said.The 2018 Leaving Cert results will be available on Wednesday 15th August while results of the Junior CertificateCycle will be available in mid-September."},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologies at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519938.1528180184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels talks mark beginning of crucial fortnight on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Photograph: EPABALAZS MOHAIToday begins a critical fortnight in the Brexit negotiations, with Irish officials expecting to receive long-awaited British proposals on the Border in the coming days. Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border. The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March. “Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th. Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal. An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own,” says the Institute for Government report.“It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments and is politically acceptable.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell.

But now the UUK and the National Union of Students (NUS) have launched a joint initiative to identify best practice.A series of evidence gathering sessions and online survey data from students and staff will inform the recommendations which will be published in December this year.Baroness Valerie Amos, director of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said: “This is a pressing problem. Too many students from BME backgrounds who get into university have a challenging experience. Many drop out and all the evidence points to an attainment gap.She added: We need to understand the barriers to BME student success so we can eliminate these gaps. We must ensure that students from all backgrounds can succeed.“Amatey Doku, vice president for higher education at the NUS, said: ”The gap starkly demonstrates that universities are complicit in the perpetuation of structural inequalities.“NUS has been instrumental in pushing for change and I\u0027m delighted that finally we will begin to see real action.”The time for action is now and the call for evidence today is a step in the right direction, towards eradicating the gap that exists between white and non-white graduates and ensuring institutions take race equality seriously.Last month, the University of Hertfordshire announced a module\u0026nbspon Black Lives Matter activist movement\u0026nbspin an attempt to\u0026nbspaddress the BAME attainment gap in higher education.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But they are still allowed to attend meetings - just not when their pay is being discussed.It comes after the University and College Union (UCU) revealed that more than nine in 10 university vice-chancellors either sit on, or attend, the committee that sets their salaries.The union has\u0026nbspsaid that a “bizarre gentleman’s agreement” - where the vice-chancellor steps outside of a committee meeting while their pay is discussed - is not the way to tackle excessive pay.\u0026nbspVice-chancellors\u0027 pay has been in the spotlight in recent months - with growing concern over university leaders who take home hundreds of thousands of pounds having a say in their own salary.The new Higher Education Senior Staff Remuneration Code, which had been designed to create a more transparent and open system, says salaries must demonstrate “value for money”.Universities must calculate and publish the ratio of their\u0026nbspleaders\u0027 pay compared to the median earnings of their\u0026nbspworkforce. If this multiple is significantly above average they will have to explain why.This means, for example, that a university would need to state if the vice-chancellor is earning two, three or four times (or more) the typical salary at the university.Institutions which do not comply with the voluntary code will be required to “publicly explain” how alternative arrangements meet the principles of the guidance.The Office for Students, the new regulator for higher education, will look into whether an institution follows the code or not, when establishing whether it has a licence to operate.\u0026nbspIf the regulator deems that this is not the case, they can apply fines and other penalties.But Sally Hunt, UCU general secretary, does not think the voluntary code will successfully tackle the high salaries, bonuses and expenses of university bosses.“This woefully inadequate code is nothing more than another plea for restraint to a group of people who have ignored every previous request,” she said.\u0026nbspThe UCU revealed in February that nearly half of vice-chancellors are members of their university\u0027s remuneration bodies, while others are able to attend meetings.Ms Hunt added: “A bizarre gentleman’s agreement where the boss steps outside while their pay is discussed is not how you tackle excessive pay.“The embarrassing comparisons some vice-chancellors have made between themselves and bankers and footballers, or the pride they have taken in their Bentleys and yachts, has demonstrated how out of touch they are.”\u0026nbspInstead, the UCU has called for staff and students to have a place on remuneration committees to ensure that university bosses are held to account.\u0026nbspChris Sayers, chair of the CUC, said: “Vice-chancellors lead some of the most complex organisations in the UK. Their leadership has helped the UK higher education system become one of the best in the world in terms of teaching and research.\u0026nbsp“To sustain these world-class\u0026nbsporganisations, it is vital that institutions recruit, retain and reward those people that are responsible for that success.\u0026nbsp“However, it is equally important that universities balance the need for recruiting the best talent with the need to demonstrate value for money and that is why we have published this guidance.\u0026nbsp“We are confident the new code will promote more transparency and improve the public’s understanding of and confidence in the way decisions around pay are made.”Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, said: “Universities receive significant amounts of public funding, so it is only right that their senior staff pay arrangements command public confidence and deliver value for money for both students and taxpayers.“I welcome the publication of the CUC Higher Education Senior Staff Remuneration Code as an important step in ensuring that senior staff pay in Higher Education is fair, justifiable and transparent.\u0026nbsp“I am pleased the new code includes a ban on vice-chancellors sitting on the committees that set their pay.\u0026nbsp“We have also taken concrete action to address excess pay, giving the Office for Students powers to tackle this issue if universities do not take action.”The basic salary of vice-chancellors increased by 2.3 per cent in the 12 months up to January, bringing the average basic salary of university bosses to £255,502, latest CUC figures show.Professor Dame Glynis Breakwell, who\u0026nbspis stepping down from the University of Bath\u0027s top job\u0026nbspin August, has a\u0026nbspsalary and benefits that total\u0026nbspmore than £468,000.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A car industry executive told the broadcaster said the change was a “catastrophe” for the car industry.“The hard Brexiteers have built a bomb under the UK automotive industry and the EU have lit it,” they said.It says UK supplies have already started losing orders for cars to export to countries like South Korea, Canada, and South Africa which have free trade agreements with the EU.Exit from the customs union and the subsequent changes to rules of origin are also likely to be disruptive for British businesses in other ways. UK exporters selling into the EU under any future free trade agreement would have to prove they originate from the UK, which can be a costly and bureaucratic procedure, reducing the competitiveness of British goods compared to EU ones. UK businesses that use components sourced from outside the EU may also not gain preferential access if they are found to be mostly worked on elsewhere.Under most rules of origin, a manufacturer needs to show that around 55 per cent of its value was created in the EU. The rules, which are a standard feature of all trade agreements across the world, are in place to stop countries re-exporting goods produced elsewhere on favourable terms.Staying in the EU customs union would remove all of these issues because the UK would continue to coordinate its trade policy with the EU.Commenting on the new warning, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said: “Preferential rules of origin were the subject of my very first meeting on my very first day in the European Commission back in 1994. They have not become any simpler since.”A UK Government spokesperson said: This is simply dealing with what would happen in a \u0027no-deal\u0027 scenario.We are in the process of discussing our future partnership with the EU, and in March we reached agreement on the terms of an implementation period that will start on 30 March 2019 and last until 31 December 2020, which will see our market access continue on current terms.A clear priority is to maintain continuity in our relationships with third countries as we exit the EU, and we\u0027ve agreed with the EU that they will notify the other parties to international agreements that, during the implementation period, the United Kingdom is to be treated as a Member State for the purposes of these agreements.This is in line with the draft Withdrawal Agreement text published before March European Council.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, are all members of the EEA without being members of the EU.But critics say EEA membership will mean Britain will be forced to obey Brussels rules without having a voice in how rules are determined.Labour\u0027s amendments seek to give the UK full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations, with no new impediments to trade and common rights, standards and protections as a minimum.Shadow EU Exit Secretary Keir Starmer said: \u0026ldquoLabour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the Single Market and protects jobs and living standards.\u0026ldquoUnlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman should be served with a formal warning."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411166735.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"these incredible photographs looked like theyre photoshopped but theyre totally genuine","story":"However despite the optical illusions and bizarre elements, they are all totally genuine.In a strange snap a boat looks like it is floating in mid air metres above inviting blue water.And in another mind-blowing image a huge pink wave threatens to take out a vessel off the coast of Australia.A teenager manages to walk on water in one shot, while a boat appears to emerge out of a cloud in the San Fransisco sky in another.All of the pictures look like they have been photoshopped, but they havent been doctored at all..."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408822955.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour refuses to refund supporters who bought 35 tickets to jezfest music event before the party started giving them away free","story":"Only a few thousand tickets have been sold to the hard left leader’s ‘Labour Live’ music festival day on June 16.The north London venue has a capacity of 20,000, running the risk of it looking like a major snub for Mr Corbyn.To save his blushes, dozens of constituency Labour parties across the country are being sent 30 free tickets each.And coaches are also being laid on to transport activists on the day also without any charge.But the giveaway sparked a backlash among other party supporters, who demanded a refund having shelled out £35.Labour last night refused to reveal how many tickets they had sold at full price.  A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A small number of tickets have been donated to some CLPs.“We look forward to hosting Labour LIVE which will be a fun day out for all our supporters and members of the local community.”It also emerged two weeks ago that the Unite trade union has also bought up 1,000 tickets to give away to its members."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411201678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"world map literal translations country names","story":"But they are infact the literal meaning of Spain and Cameroon, as revealed by fascinating maps offering an insight into the original names of countries.While some are fairly obvious, such as Englands -

Dagenham legend Eileen Pullen, 88, is delighted that her great-granddaughter’s generation are prepared to continue her fight for equality. “I’m all for it,” she says. “Things are a lot worse than I thought, women have a big fight in front of them. You can’t be frightened. “If you think you’re entitled to more pay, go for it.”  Eileen was one of the leaders when 185 female machinists at Dagenham, East London, went on strike in 1968 demanding an equal pay grading to their male colleagues. Tomorrow marks 50 years since the day the women, who stitched car seat covers, walked out. The covers soon ran out, halting production across the plant – proving just how integral their role was in the car manufacturing process. Their landmark action, immortalised in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, is widely credited as a catalyst for the Equal Pay Act two years later. Yet despite being enshrined in law, equal pay has yet to be achieved in workplaces across the country.  The battle fought by Eileen and her colleagues continues today, as bosses are finally being forced to open up about the 18.4% gender pay gap that means women effectively work for free for two months each year. Fellow Dagenham striker Gwen Davis says: “It makes me angry and sad. Should we have to keep fighting for everything?” Gwen, 85, of Romford, East London, is frustrated that women are still subjected to lower pay and harassment at work. Like Eileen, she fully supports the high-profile campaigns that are calling out such ill treatment. “It should all be out in the open,” she says. “Why should a man think he has a right to your body?  “This year is about a lot of things, including equal pay – but overall, for women to be treated with respect. “Now women are protesting it’s revived my hope things will start to change. Women are strong compared to what they used to be, but it shouldn’t have taken 50 years. “I don’t think many people really understand what the word feminist means, still.” Pal Eileen, of nearby Rainham, encourages great-granddaughter Katie, a 20-year-old trainee nurse, to stand her ground. Eileen says: “I’ve been mad this year. I tell Katie to stick up for herself. I say to all women, stand up for yourself, go for it, call people out. We have to.”  Eileen and Gwen have never stopped fighting for equality. In February they were on the Bafta red carpet with actress Gemma Arterton, who starred in the West End musical version of Made in Dagenham. They wore black alongside the star in support of the Time’s Up movement against sexual harassment. They believe tomorrow’s anniversary is an important opportunity to speak out for what they so passionately believe in – especially coming as it does in the centenary year of women getting the vote. Although they shrug off any \u0026shysuggestion that they were personally courageous, back in 1968 it was undoubtedly brave to walk out of Ford.  Support was not always forthcoming – especially when their actions led to the plant closing down and the men getting laid off too, leaving hundreds of families strapped for cash. But they both say they never doubted. “It was difficult but we had to do it,” says Eileen. “We had no hesitation. We all got together, we asked for a meeting, hands were shown and out we walked. We were very angry. Although looking back you wonder how you did do it.” The situation the women were fighting was around grading rather than pay, initially. Despite their job requiring two years’ training, the female machinists were classified as unskilled B-grade workers, the same as floor sweepers, with the equivalent pay and pensions to cleaners.  Every year they would ask to be re-classified as C-grade semi-skilled workers, which is how men with \u0026shyequivalent training were graded. But each year they were turned down. “We had skills the same as the men,” Gwen says. “Yet we were classed the same as the teenage boys who swept the floor.” The final straw was the discovery that some male workers were being paid extra to work on the machines at night – while women were forbidden from working nights or overtime. Both women were married and had children, but say they were lucky that their husbands did not work at Ford, so one source of income kept coming in during the strike.  Both men were supportive – Eileen says her husband would put the tea on when she went off to protests. “He knew we were fighting for our rights,” she says. However, other families were not so lucky, which is why some hostility crept in. “Some said, ‘Get back to work’,” recalls Eileen. “They said we were putting the men out of work. We had to let it go over our heads.” Ultimately, for all their efforts, the women won only a partial victory. Employment Secretary Barbara Castle promised a pay rise bringing them up to 92% of the unskilled men’s wage – an improvement on their existing 85%, but still far from equal pay or the grading change they demanded. Gwen says the women had little choice but to accept the deal.

Tory Heidi Allen spoke of how she was ill when she made the decision to have an abortion, during a debate on reforming the law in Northern Ireland. And Labour’s Jess Philips recalled her own experience, as well as sharing stories of Northern Irish women who travelled for terminations, insisting: “We are not criminals.” Heidi Allen’s voice wobbled as she told MPs: “I was ill when I made the incredibly hard decision to have a termination. I was having seizures every day, I wasn’t even able to control my own body let alone care for a new life.  “So Mr Speaker are you seriously telling me that in a civilised world rape, incest or a foetus that is so badly deformed that it could never live are not sufficient grounds for a woman to have the power to decide for herself that she shouldn’t make that decision. “No, enough. “Very suddenly and unexpectedly we have a window of opportunity before us. Whether you feel that window has opened as a consequence of no functioning administration in Northern Ireland or because a neighbouring referendum was so close and so relevant as to be impossible to ignore, or simply because you feel the glaring light of equality and human rights illuminating the women of northern Ireland. “This has become their moment and they will have my unequivocal support.” Jess Phillips recalled how the last satnav journey of a hire car she recently collected at Birmingham Airport was to the Calthorpe Clinic in the city. She explained: The place I myself had been for an abortion a decade previously. I shuddered at the thought of the woman who had hired the car before me, not to go about her working life but to go and do something I took completely for granted - myself and (Heidi Allen, Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire) are not criminals.  Ms Phillips said last week she asked Northern Irish women to get in touch with their stories of travelling to England, Scotland and Wales. She said: Today I am them, here are some of the extracts. As Ms Phillips outlined their stories, MPs were told they said: It was Christmas Eve, I was with friends at a party. I stepped outside for a breath of air and I was raped. My mum had to book the flights, book me into a clinic. This all took money. I was from a working-class family, we had to borrow it. I had to travel on my own, I\u0027d never been alone anywhere after I had been raped.

The ComRes survey reveals a staggering 82% would be willing to pay 1p more in National Insurance contributions if the money went directly to the health service. The findings will pile pressure on Theresa May to pump more money into the cash-strapped NHS. In a warning to the Prime Minister, the poll also shows voters are more likely to back the party at the next election which pledges extra funds for health and social care. Four in five adults (82%) said they supported the 1p increase if the money raised - as much as \u0026pound11billion - was ring fenced to fund the NHS.  Almost as many Tory voters (81%) as Labour voters (86%) supported the tax rise. The poll also shows a third of voters (33%) would probably change their vote at the next general election in favour of a party which promised additional funding for health and social care. And 18% would definitely switch to a party which pledged extra funds.  Voters also give a damning verdict on the Conservatives’ handling of the NHS since they came to power. More than half of all adults think the quality of service in the NHS has declined since 2010 (55%), 28% say it has stayed the same and just one in ten (9%) think it has improved. Among Tory voters 45% say the NHS has declined, 37% say it has stayed the same and 14% believe it has got worse. People in England are more likely to have a negative view on their health service than those in SNP-run Scotland and Wales, where it is run by Labour.  Three quarters of people (75%) in the North East of England say the NHS has got worse, 56% in London and 65% in Yorkshire and Humber. In Scotland 48% say the quality of healthcare has declined since 2010 and in Wales, 45%. The Mirror’s poll was conducted after Gordon Brown called for a repeat of the 1p hike in National Insurance contributions to raise \u0026pound11billion for the NHS. The former Prime Minister warned the health service is in “mortal danger” and could struggle to survive in its present form without an emergency injection of funds similar to the 1p rise he introduced as Chancellor in 2002.  The NHS will soon need an extra \u0026pound40billion of funding a year, rising to \u0026pound95billion by the 2030s. At the same time it is having to cater for an ageing population which see more than 4.4million people aged 65 or over by 2033-34 Britain’s most senior doctors last night (TUE) welcomed the poll findings and called for “urgent” action to implement the 1p tax rise. Dr Kailash Chand, honorary vice president of the British Medical Association, said the results showed Brits were “prepared to pay more” to save the NHS.  Speaking to the Daily Mirror in a personal capacity, Dr Chand said: “The results from this poll could not be clearer. “I’m very pleased because they show the vast majority of people in this country still believe the NHS is one of our most precious assets - and they are prepared to pay more to save it. “More people are being seen by the our NHS than ever before, with a rising population and soaring demand with people living longer. “Yet funding of the health service since 2010 has simply not kept pace. “The results of this poll will also send a powerful message to politicians that the public believe the NHS is in such urgent need of funds, they are prepared to pay more for the NHS. “But this cannot be the only solution. The Government must urgently raise real spending rises on the heath service to at least 4% a year.”  Dr JS Bamrah, a Consultant Psychiatrist and chairman of the British Association Of Physicians of Indian Origin, said the Government needed to “act now” to reverse Tory cuts to the NHS. Speaking in a personal capacity, he said: “It is reassuring that even during these stressful financial times people cherish the NHS sufficiently to dig deep into their pockets for its survival. “We need to act now to reverse the damage caused by austerity and senseless reforms, so that patients can access and get the quality services they deserve from struggling mental health services, general practices and A\u0026ampEs.” In a recent report for the IPPR, the NHS surgeon and former Labour Health Minister Lord Darzi has also backed an increase in National Insurance to fund the NHS. He said it was a “small price to pay” for a “more civilised and caring society.” The move is also supported by former Tory Health Minister Lord Prior who said it would provide the NHS with the long-term funding settlement that it needs to be fit for the 2020s. A growing number of Tory MPs have also demanded the Government increases taxes to fund the NHS.

It\u0027s because she is one of the few people in the world with no fingerprints - which has led to problems at airports. It\u0027s interesting when you try to go to America and they try and take your fingerprints and you say you haven\u0027t got any, said Heather. I went to New York with my mum in 2005 and it was our turn to show our passports. Mum did her fingerprints and when it came to me I said \u0027I don\u0027t have any fingerprints\u0027.

Heather was born a \u0027butterfly child\u0027 - a term given to children with a rare condition that makes the skin so fragile it\u0027s compared to the wings of a butterfly.  She has had no skin on her back for 21 years and gets up every morning knowing the day ahead involves hours of bandage changes to protect her open wounds. She regularly wakes up with new blisters that have grown overnight like bubblewrap and need to be popped with sterilised needles. And her daily routine involves attaching a tube to her stomach that feeds her for 10 hours as she sleeps at night. Heather also has to put a lens in her right eye every day after an infected blister ate away at her own in 2007, forcing her to have a corneal transplant. But despite her struggles, she remains incredibly defiant. It affects my life from the minute I get up in the morning to the minute I go to bed, she said. I get the odd comments when I\u0027m out on the streets like \u0027urgh\u0027 but it\u0027s ignorance. She added: On bad days I\u0027m grumpy and I cry. I don\u0027t do anything, I just cry and think \u0027why me?\u0027  There are days when I want to give up. But then I have to have to accept it and have a reality check as it could be worse. Heather\u0027s mum Wendy was shocked and heartbroken when her baby emerged with no skin on her left hand or right foot, and doctors explained her condition. Heather has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a skin disorder that causes it to become very fragile and creates painful blisters with any trauma or friction. The life-limiting condition also means she gets blisters inside her eyes and down her throat - a terrifying reality as it means her throat can close over and she needs surgery to open it out again. My back is red raw Research has shown that people with some types of EB face a hugely increased risk of an aggressive and ultimately fatal form of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, according to the charity DEBRA, which supports people with the disorder and their families. They say it tends to occur at sites of increased blistering and scarring but research into the precise link between skin cancer and EB is ongoing.  Heather, from Swindon, has had the disease six times in the last two years.  She has recently had an operation to remove skin affected by cancer on her neck and has this month been given the all clear - for now. She says EB is the biggest condition no one has ever heard of - yet it shapes her life and means she plans her every move meticoulously. Growing up she has learnt to cope with staring, people complaining about her being in hot tubs and pools, accusations that her mum has let her get sunburnt, and struggles to be intimate in relationships. But Heather is unafraid of EB, is determined to raise awareness of it and help DEBRA.Explaining her condition to Mirror, Heather said: I haven\u0027t got any skin on my back, it\u0027s been open since I was six and has never healed in 21 years.  My back is red raw and sometimes it’s described as looking like a piece of liver. It’s sore and very itchy. I’m not supposed to scratch it, but I do sometimes which blisters and rips it. My hands are one of the worst areas, I don’t have any nails from where the skin on my hands has retracted - that\u0027s why they\u0027re so small. I also don\u0027t have any fingerprints. People are shocked and laugh, saying I could rob a bank. My arms don’t go straight because of the creases and scarring I have that restricts the skin. My feet are also different sizes - my right is a child size 12 and my left is an adult size 3. EB affects my skin internally and externally. I even get blisters in my eyes.  EB is life limiting, and it usually kills at quite a young age. With dystrophic there isn\u0027t an average age for life expectancy, it depends, everybody is different. Before Heather was born, her mum had no idea she would have EB. It was only when she came out with no skin on her left hand and right foot - which eventually healed on their own- that doctors diagnosed her. The charity DEBRA supported Wendy, 64, and put her in touch with parents of other sufferers so she could make sense of her daughter\u0027s condition. It was shocking for my mum, Heather said, revealing what she\u0027s learnt about her childhood. She’s told me I used to scream throughout the dressing changes.  It was horrible and heartbreaking for my mum when I\u0027d cry. As a child, mum wanted me to be as independent as possible but wanted to protect me as well. I couldn’t just go out with my friends because I needed help with my wheelchair. I used to swim but I just can’t anymore because my back just hurts too much. When Heather was six she had a gastronomy peg - a feeding tube - put into her stomach because she only weighed two and a half stone. She has used it every night since and it gives her a litre of a special ‘milk’ which contains the fibres, vitamins and minerals she needs to survive. Dr Helen Philips, Global Head of Medical Affairs for Amryt Pharma, said: “It’s estimated that there are more than 500,000 people living with EB worldwide, including around 2,000 people managed in specialist centres in the UK.  EB can be overwhelming and psychologically devastating to live with for both children and their carers.  Parents regularly find themselves as their child’s nurse and main carer, having to go through the difficult routine of changing bandages and dressing wounds while watching their child suffer with intolerable pain.  While significant advancements have been made in the development of therapies aimed at correcting the underlying genetic defects seen in EB, with the expectation that a cure for the disease will be developed in the long term, currently there is no cure for the condition.  Current wound care management involves daily or regular dressing changes to protect the skin, encourage healing and prevent infection.  Depending on disease severity, dressing changes can take several hours each day, often requiring the use of prescription medications to manage their excruciating pain.  The greatest need of those living with EB, and their carers, is to access better ways to manage the daily consequences of their condition, especially their wounds which are often associated with unbearable itch, pain and frequently become infected.  A cure is definitely something to aspire to achieving but short-term solutions are a priority – it is about the ‘here and now’.” As this tube goes into her stomach, she must lie on her back - and the constant friction between the bedsheets and her skin is why her back has never healed. \u2028Her neck is also affected and “anywhere that can rub, including the creases of my elbows, the backs of my legs where I sit down, my hips and armpits, Heather says. The friction from seams of clothing or anyone bumping into her when she\u0027s out can cause blisters or rip the skin off. There are days when I want to give up The young woman also has a restrictive oesophagus and narrow throat so has to be careful with what she eats. She is able to digest soft food but scratchy or chewy foods - for example crisps or steak- can scar her throat and cause it to contract. Until now, she\u0027s had six operations to release her throat after it has tightened.  Heather\u0027s mum helps her with the process of changing any bandages that need re-dressing and to pop any blisters. She applies treatment creams in the morning and has medication to control the pain throughout the day. The morning changes only take about 20 minutes, she says. But every evening her entire back is re-bandaged, a process which takes about two hours. She also has to put her eye drops in as part of her routine.  Heather, who has had several administrative jobs in the past but is currently focusing on her treatment, says: A blister breaks down into a wound - if I don’t feel it, it can be two or three times the size by the morning. If they rip, they need to be dressed. “It’s like bubble wrap, when you pierce it, it deflates. “I wouldn’t get to sleep without my medication, it puts me in a relaxed state. But I still get pain throughout the night. Doing the bandages is part of my daily life. I\u0027ve never known anything different. It\u0027s painful but I\u0027m used to the pain. It\u0027s just physically and mentally exhausting It\u0027s never going to change so I can\u0027t mope - it\u0027s not going to heal it. Throughout the day, Heather says she needs somebody with her to help with her wheelchair. She is able to walk around the house but for longer distances uses her chair. She has to plan outings around dressing changes, and is limited to only going away with people who she knows, trusts and can help with her routine.  Heather says one of the things she\u0027s had to deal with is people staring and making complaints about her. When I was younger on holiday people would tut and assume my mum had let me get sunburnt, she revealed. One complaint that sticks in my head was on a trip to Florida in 2009. There was a couple in the hot tub and after we got in, they got out. The manager then came and said to my mum \u0027what\u0027s wrong with her, maybe she shouldn\u0027t be in a hot tub\u0027. But my mum explained I was more likely to catch something from others than the other way round. It really hurt- to have somebody complain that I could be contagious was so hurtful. When I was 13 someone complained about me being in a pool in Spain as well which was so hurtful, she added. My mum carried leaflets in different languages on holiday to give to people and explained to children that I was born with poorly skin but that I was going to have it for life but that it’s OK.  Mum is incredible, I think that\u0027s where I get my strength from.  Heather has several other people who help her including her best friend Carly, Lorraine who is like her \u0027second mum\u0027 and her first friend Nikii. She is currently single but has had relationships in the past, although she says maintaining them has been difficult. Heather explained: The last one ended as I feel it was too much to deal with. EB is a massive part of my life and expecting somebody to bring that into their day to day life is quite a big thing. In relationships, the intimacy is difficult because I\u0027m not comfortable with my body. I\u0027m not dying. I\u0027m still incredibly fit The thing Heather finds most difficult to deal with though is the regular occurrence of skin cancer. She has had 15 operations in the last two and a half years after biopsies on lumps, abnormal scabs and blisters showed she had cancer on her right knee, right hand, her neck and her foot. The last surgery was on her neck at the start of this month, and she\u0027s relieved to have been given the all-clear.

Dr Vaishnavy Vilvanathan Laxman mistakenly carried out a natural delivery, even though the premature infant was in the breech condition. Tragically the baby\u0027s head was detached inside his mum\u0027s womb. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MTPS) panel found Laxman, 43, should have given the 30-year-old patient an emergency Caesarean section. The first-time mum was 25 weeks pregnant when it happened at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee in March 2014.  The panel said the only appropriate course was a caesarean section as the baby - known as baby B - was in the breech position. His head became trapped during the birth, and his head became detached from his body during efforts to free him. MTPS said he had died before this happened. On Tuesday, the tribunal cleared Dr Laxman of serious misconduct and said her fitness to practise was not impaired.

Behailu Kebede, whose fridge is thought to have started blaze which killed 72 people on June 14 last year, did not pack a suitcase and leave with it, his barrister Rajiv Menon QC told the ongoing inquiry. He added that the claim was a nasty lie that was first reported in the days after the fire. He was not able to connect immediately and had to make a number of calls before being able to speak to an operator. Meanwhile, he banged on bedroom doors of flatmates and shouted \u0027fire, fire, fire!\u0027, said Mr Menon.  Mr Kebede then alerted his flatmates to the fire as well as the the residents of the other five flats on the fourth floor. Barefoot and clutching his phone, he then left the building and watched in horror as the fire spread up the tower.  On Monday the inquiry heard his panicked 999 phonecall begging fire brigades to \u0027come quick\u0027. He lived in Flat 16 on the 4th floor, where the fire started before it burst out his window and the cladding caught fire, turning the tower into a deadly inferno. Me Menon continued: The calamitous events of Grenfell tower and the subsequent media intrusion have had serious consequences for Mr Kebede and his family. His partner and children felt unsafe in their home and were forced to move out. He said claims the fridge-freezer had been tampered with were \u0027palpable nonsense\u0027. The trauma of the events mean Mr Kebede has been excused from giving oral evidence himself The inquiry was briefly interrupted by applause from members of Justice For Grenfell sitting in the hearing. Sir Martin Moore-Bick asked audience members to ‘keep yourselves under control’.

Alfie Wiseman claims he was asked to leave by security staff before they \u0027grabbed\u0027 him and \u0027threw his belongings out of the door\u0027. His girlfriend Jodie Work, was admitted to hospital when she lost two litres of blood and suffered a miscarriage. The pair met five years ago and already have a seven-month-old girl, Aaliyah-Rose, but they found out they were expecting another baby this year.  Jodie, 22, was 11-weeks pregnant when she went to the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) in Harlow with a small bleed.  I went to the hospital and asked for a scan, she told Essex Live .  They told me to come back on Thursday as I was due for an appointment. Later that evening I started gushing out blood at my home. I needed an ambulance and I had lost two litres of blood. I was losing more and I waited over an hour for an ambulance to arrive. Jodie claims when she arrived at the hospital she was left sitting in A\u0026ampE for 30 minutes before being transferred to another room. She said: I was left in a room with bits of my baby and blood on me. After they had tragically lost the baby, Alfie sat by her side but was asked to leave because Jodie was staying on a female-only ward. She requested to move so that she didn\u0027t have to be alone, but this didn\u0027t happen. Jodie said: Alfie is going through the same as me and just because he is the father doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t affecting him, but they sent security down to move him. Alfie, 24, added: I saw what she was going though and she didn\u0027t want me to leave so I asked If I could stay longer. The staff who dish out the tea said they would ask a manager.  Next thing, security came and asked me to leave. They don’t care. Alfie left the ward as directed by security staff and decided to sit in the waiting room. He added: I didn’t feel comfortable going home when she was still in the hospital. The security guard grabbed me by the arm and I was trying to explain to them what happened, to see if he had a little bit of a heart, but he had nearly broken my arm. Alfie then claims the staff threw his bag and belongings out the door so he would leave. I was in a big state and asked to see the managers, who then came down and apologised for the incident, he explained. Staff at PAH then allowed the dad to stay longer in the ward to spend time with Jodie. Jodie said the treatment she received whilst recovering was not up to standards and feels the nurses were not sympathetic to her situation. The mum said: Other children kept coming in to visit their mums and nurses were talking to other staff, saying it was their two-year-old son\u0027s birthday. She said: The nurses kept leaving my curtain open and I wanted to be on my own. I pressed for the nurse and she came over and said \u0027I\u0027m getting sick of you pressing the buzzer, what did your last slave die of?\u0027 I asked her to close the curtain and she said, \u0027Can\u0027t you get up and do it yourself?\u0027, when I am lying there having a blood transfusion and I just lost a baby.

For one of the nation’s best loved dressings has fallen out of favour with modern Brits as just 14% drizzle it over their lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. According to research by the snack giant, the under 30s prefer to slather it over tuna, ham or cheese in sandwiches or use it as an alternative to mayonnaise for chips. Launched in 1914 specifically for the UK market, the condiment with a signature tang, took eight years to perfect for British tastebuds.  But the bottles are set for a dramatic makeover as American owner Kraft Heinz revealed it no longer reflects the UK’s changing palette. Heinz is now working with trendy London design agency Jones Knowles Ritchie on a revamp after revealing the traditional salad dressing’s name did not “fairly represent the product’s ingredients or usage occasions”. A spokesperson told trade journal The Grocer: “As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers. “There are consumers now who haven’t grown up with the brand in the household and just don’t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.” New look bottles are expected to hit supermarket shelves in September with the name change aimed at younger shoppers.

On June 5 last year, Elley Taylor arrived at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth expecting to find her boyfriend, 20-year-old Marshall Arnott with a few broken bones.  He had been travelling home from work with two friends when their van overturned on the A38 in averse weather conditions.  The three men, who were aged under 25, were all killed. Now a year on, 20-year-old Elley Taylor, mum to Marshall\u0027s daughter Isla, has described how each day since his death has been a battle.  She was already suffering from post-natal depression at the time of the crash which made the trauma of losing Marshall and their dreams of living happily ever after even worse.  “You can’t sugar coat it,” she told Plymouth Live .  But she’s determined to be a good mother and says that Isla, who looks just like her dad, has got her though the darkest time of her life. Isla was just four months old when Marshall, along with his two friends Zachary Graham and Trevor Gorman were killed. “It was horrible,” Elley said. “All I wanted to do was run away and breathe but I had a baby to look after.  “Everyone says to me ‘It’s such a brilliant thing that you’ve got Isla - she’ll help you get though it’. “I had problems having a baby before so it was a really big thing for us. I was so thankful and so grateful but it almost felt unfair. “As soon as I had the baby something awful happened. I hated the world for a long time. “I spent all that time trying for a baby, I had operations for it, and then I had a baby but I lose him. “Even though it is a blessing and I couldn’t have done it without Isla, everyone else got to grieve – if they wanted to sleep for two weeks they could, if they wanted to cry they could cry if they wanted to go and forget it on a night out they could, but I spent the nights doing night feeds on my own for God knows how long. Elley first met Marshall, her affectionately nicknamed Marshmallow, at school aged 16.  They were “obsessed” with one another and the only time they ever spent apart was when she was in hospital. She says: “I loved that idea that I could say to my kids when I grew up that we were together since we were 16. “I used to say I was so fortunate that I found him so young. He was everything I ever wanted. I felt so lucky. I couldn’t fault him in any way. “He was an amazing dad and an amazing family, an amazing brother and an amazing son.”  Since Marshall was killed in the crash, Elley has described each day as a battle and revealed she has even had to fight suicidal thoughts.  Fearing she would one day take her own life to be with Marshall, she wrote a note to Isla explaining why.  “It was on my mind so strongly for so long. I was going down to the grave every day. It was horrible that he was there and I was here, she said. “It got to the point where I felt so empty. “People say it gets better in time but it doesn’t. You just learn not to cry so much. You learn to suffer in silence in a way. That pain will never go. “I want to be with him now. That’s a daily challenge for me to get through each day. There was a really bad time when I wrote a letter to Isla and I wrote a letter to my brother Curtis. “He was so happy. He was so loving and caring – he loved everything that he had in his life. I had post-natal depression. I was already very low and very depressed.  “Being at his grave and taking Isla down there. I used to think ‘why are you down there and I’m up here?’ “The plan was to live happily ever after. This feeling went on for so long. I wrote Isla the letter just in case. “It said that if she was reading this letter I was with daddy and it was okay. “I put it in an envelope and put it to one side.” Even now she feels she has to choose between being with her baby and being with the man she loved. “I want to be with both of them, she says. That’s a very hard thing to live with.  “I said it from the beginning – if I can chose any other way, other than him not being in that accident, that it would have been the three of us together. “I know that would have hurt a lot more people but I wouldn’t have been without him and Isla wouldn’t have been without a dad.” Despite Isla and Marshall only having a few precious months together, Elley is adamant that she will know her dad. Pictures of the young family are dotted around the flat and lovingly crafted photo albums fill the shelves. She says: “A lot of people around me didn’t like to hear his name. It was too fresh but I have his daughter – she had to know who her daddy is.  “I had to teach her so young to remember him. Now she can point him out in a photo. There’s a photo of him by the door. Every morning and every night we kiss him and say hello. “I hope he would be proud. “I feel like she was brought here and I was meant to look after her and I feel that she is looking after me. I feel like she was brought here because she knew I needed somebody. Elley is now looking to the future and has secured a place to study counselling at college in September. She hopes that by being so honest about her struggles will make other people realise they\u0027re also “allowed” to feel sad when bad things happen.

It is believed the body discovered in the Rochdale Canal in the city was that of Orlando Nyero, who had been reported missing on Sunday. The search for the missing 19-year-old student was called off after Tuesday\u0027s grim find. Police have made it clear that the death is not believed to be suspicious, but the tragedy has renewed speculation of a Manchester Pusher serial killer. It was estimated in April that at least 76 bodies have been pulled from Manchester\u0027s waterways in 11 years, with 17 of the deaths left unexplained. Other estimates have put the total even higher at 85.  One Manchester resident wrote on Twitter: More canal deaths in Manchester than Venice (!) in last 10 years, nearly all young men, but nope, no suspicious circumstances. Another added: I can’t believe that another young man has been found dead in Manchester’s canals.  Tell the truth GMP. There simply can’t be that many accidents! More families suffering call it what it is... a serial killer!! #pusher. Fears that a murderer is stalking the city\u0027s waterways and shoving unsuspecting or vulnerable victims into the water are revived after every new tragic death. But Greater Manchester Police and local council chiefs have insisted there is no evidence to suggest a serial killer is at work, and have called the Manchester Pusher theory an urban myth that never goes away.  In April, the theory was debated again when a 34-year-old cyclist told how he was thrown into a canal at night by a psychopath assailant. The man told the Sunday Times he almost drowned after his legs became tangled in his bike at the Bridgewater Canal towpath, close to Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium. The victim said: “I asked the police about the ‘Manchester Pusher’ legend and they were well aware of the stories. I definitely feel like I’m lucky to be alive.”  His wife warned others of a “canal pusher” on a community page on Facebook. But police assured the public that there was nothing to connect the case to any other incidents, including canal deaths, and there had been no further reports of a similar suspect - a white male wearing a black jacket, aged 20-40 and of average height. Following the April incident, Councillor Pat Karney, Manchester’s city centre spokesman, said the Manchester Pusher theory was an urban myth. He told the : “The police and the council have examined every case in the city centre over the last 10 years and have found no link or connection between the fatalities.  Most of the tragedies are through accidents caused by alcohol. “It’s an urban myth that will never die, and any time there’s an incident or accident it comes up again. I think it causes distress to the families that have lost their loved ones.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nurse one year old baby","story":"NewsNurse has her one-year-old baby taken off her because she let him play in Bob the Builder car for older kidsA social worker told the court she was concerned about the woman\u0027s \u0027basic parenting skills\u0027 after observing her with the baby in the play area\u0026nbspShareByElaine McCahill10:33, 6 JUN 2018NewsA woman had her one-year-old baby taken from her care after a social worker saw her letting the child play in a Bob the Builder car for older children (Image: Free Picture)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA qualified nurse has had a one-year-old boy taken from her care after after she let him play in a Bob the Builder toy car for older children. A social worker raised concern about the way the mother let him sit in the toy, which she said was inappropriate for his age. The social worker told a family court judge how she had concerns about the woman\u0027s basic parenting skills after observing her with the child in a play area. Judge Eleanor Owens heard how the social worker also felt that the woman had not fed the boy appropriately and had not changed his nappy appropriately.   Son admits killing his own mother \u0027after an argument over cup of tea that wasn\u0027t milky enough\u0027  The judge said all professionals involved were concerned about the woman\u0027s lack of insight and said the social worker had highlighted some of those concerns. She ruled that the little boy should live with relatives, but said he would be able to stay in touch with his mother. Detail of the case has emerged in a ruling by Judge Owens following a private family court hearing in Reading, Berkshire. Council social services staff had asked her to make decisions about the boy\u0027s future.  She said no-one involved could be identified. Judge Owens said the woman was a qualified nurse, but had an extremely low range of intellectual inability. She said an independent social worker had prepared a report after observing mother and son. The independent social worker highlighted some of the concerns around [the woman\u0027s] ability to meet the needs of [the boy], said the judge in her ruling.

Myah Hauxwell was born with a rare generic condition called micropthalmia, also known as small eye syndrome. She has undergone more than 10 operations on her face and eye, and was previously using a prosthetic eye given to her by the NHS, the Nottingham Post reports.  But after Myah outgrew the prosthetic eye, mum Lauren Hauxwell was forced to raise funds to have a new one made by a private company. The funds were raised but the new eye was too heavy, meaning Myah\u0027s face was becoming deformed by the weight of the prosthesis. Next month she will undergo yet more surgery, at the Queen\u0027s Medical Centre, to create an eye socket for her using body fat from her stomach.  Miss Hauxwell, 31, hopes this could be the start of the end for her daughter\u0027s troubles. She said: They eye is weighing her face down which is making it deformed, but if she takes it out, the eye starts to close back up again. She\u0027s had six operations to expand the eye socket so we can\u0027t leave it out for any longer than 12 hours otherwise it begins to close up. She is going to have what they call a dermis fat graft, where they will remove fat from her stomach and build the socket from that. Fingers crossed it works but it\u0027s not 100 percent. They have to take exactly the right amount of fat because it can be affected if she puts weight on or loses weight.  Once the operation has taken place, Myah will be given a clear shell cover on her eye until she can get a new prosthetic eye made. The youngster has been battling through the problems for her entire life, although it doesn\u0027t affect her too much because her mum says she doesn\u0027t know any different. She just gets on with it, said Miss Hauxwell. I don\u0027t treat her any differently because it\u0027s better for her that way. She is now fundraising to help support Myah through her treatment and to pay for her new eye.

The Thornton Science Park site has been home to the university\u0027s science and engineering department since 2014.  But the local council\u0027s planning committee has rejected a retrospective application on advice from health and safety experts.   They feared students would be put at risk of there was a toxic gas release or explosion at the Stanlow refinery next door, the Chester Chronicle reports.   Cheshire West and Chester Council\u0027s planning committee voted seven to four to prevent the university facility changing its designation from an industrial to an educational site. The move is disastrous for the university, as there will be widespread repercussions for students and tech firms which have based themselves at the science park. The world class facility, a site gifted by Shell, is part of the Cheshire Science Corridor and the government’s Northern Powerhouse vision. Former Ellesmere Port and Neston MP Andrew Miller and university vice chancellor Professor Tim Wheeler were among those to speak out in support of the university at the meeting.  But Councillor Brian Jones told the committee: “My concern is to go against the Health and Safety Executive on their recommendation. I think was it Flixborough that exploded years ago.” He said the test was to treat retrospective applications based on all the evidence as though no operations had commenced. Mr Jones added: “Would we have given planning permission to Thornton Research if they had asked for planning permission with the proviso the Health and Safety Executive were against it and I believe the answer would have been no.” Fellow committee member Councillor Jill Houlbrook agreed, saying: “We cannot put economics above the lives of our young people. I’m sorry, we just can’t.”  She used to work at Thornton as a clerk and said the site was only separated from Stanlow by a wire fence. She added: “I well remember in the afternoon having to shut the windows to keep the foul smells out of the offices. “It’s not like the boat museum or the Blue Planet, it’s right next door to a major refinery. “No matter how many health and safety regulations you’ve got in place, if something goes wrong and the whole thing goes up, you really don’t have a chance.  I now think about the students and their parents who would be attending the university and being put in that position. Councillor Brian Crowe, who was among those favour of the application, told the meeting that he thought the level of risk to students and staff was being overstated. He said: It comes down to risk doesn’t it? How do we as individuals judge the risk. In my view I think the HSE are overstating the risk element. With the HSE I’m afraid it’s the nature of the beast that they always look at the worst case scenario.” "},{"url":null,"title":"virgin hot air balloon makes","story":"NewsVirgin hot air balloon makes unexpected landing in middle of housing estate surprising residentsThe unexpected landing didn\u0027t stop its 11 passengers popping open the Champagne once safely on the ground in Perth, Scotland\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByColette CrampseyMiranda Blazeby10:31, 6 JUN 2018NewsThe hot air balloon set out for an hour long flight yesterday morning (Image: Collect Unknown)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailResidents of a Scottish housing estate got a surprise visit after a huge Virgin hot air balloon made an unexpected landing after high winds sparked safety fears.

The 11 people on board had been on an hour-long flight from Perth\u0027s North Inch public park when high winds forced the pilot to make an unplanned landing in the residential area. Despite the high winds, the balloon made a safe landing in a park on Rannoch Road at around 8am on Tuesday.

A spokesperson for Virgin Balloon Flights said: “While most of our flights usually come in to land out in the countryside, sometimes wind conditions result in pilots setting them down in more built up areas, which are still completely normal and safe landings.

Joe Cairnie, 31, was found dead in a hotel room in Bangkok, Thailand, on Sunday after worried friends raised the alarm when they were unable to contact him.  His shocked family are now planning to bring him home so he can be buried next to his sister Suzanne, who was just 15 when she was mown down by a car moments after stepping off a bus in Glasgow in 2006.  In a heartbreaking tribute, his sister Michelle said: “I never ever wanted to feel loss like this ever again. And their dad said: “You just never think lightning will strike twice in one family, but it has.”   John, 50, from Milngavie, near Glasgow, spoke to the Daily Record yesterday of his agony at losing a second child.  He said: “We are still coming to terms with losing Suzanne, and now Joe is gone too. “I just can’t believe what has happened – and what makes it worse is that we don’t know the details surrounding Joe’s death. “We’ve been told we will have to wait on the results of a postmortem, and that will take four to five days. “We had no idea anything was wrong until two police officers arrived at my door on Monday and told me Joe was gone. “I’m speaking with the consulate and just want to know what happened to my son. “We don’t know if he was unwell, if his drink was spiked or if something else happened. “It could be anything, we just don’t know. We’re numb.  John spoke to his son on Friday, just moments before he boarded a flight from Heathrow to Bangkok. Joe, who worked for Glasgow City Council before moving to Cambridge two years ago, was meeting friends during the 10-day trip. John said: “It was his first holiday in years and he was looking forward to it. “He was rushing to catch his flight when I spoke to him. I told him to enjoy the experience and be safe. “I never thought it would be our last conversation. “He was a great lad and the life and soul of our family. “Although he moved down south, he would come up and visit a lot. He was working hard and had his whole life ahead of him. “It’s just so tragic that he’s gone. “We just want him back home because he’s so far away. “Joe will be buried next to his sister Suzanne at Langfaulds Cemetery. “All of the family are in bits, it’s just so hard to accept.”  Joe didn’t have travel insurance and a JustGiving page has been set up by his friend Oliver Mcdonald to help the family with the cost of repatriating the body. By last night, more than \u0026pound9500 had been raised and John said the family were overwhelmed by the kind donations. He added: “Joe was a popular boy and had so many friends. “It was typical of him to go abroad with no insurance. He was happy-go-lucky and never thought anything would happen to him. “He was important to a lot of people and after hearing of his death a close friend set up the page. “We just want to do all we can to bring Joe home. It will cost thousands and we’ll also have to arrange the funeral.” Mum Jayne Bates, who is divorced from Joe’s dad, posted on social media: “Cant believe this… Want too wake up and its all been a nightmare. Broken is a word. I’m nothing without you son. I love you with all my heart. “Wish I could swap places with you. Oh joe your my world without you in it. I cant see a life. Please this can’t be real. Xx (sic)”  Joe’s siblings Michelle, 24, Stephanie, 20, and Michell, 17, are also heartbroken by the sudden loss. Michelle posted a touching tribute saying: “I am in bits. Why has this happened? “I love and miss you Joe so much. I just want you home so I can give you a big cuddle. “I really wish this wasn’t true. I am absolutely heartbroken. “I never ever wanted to feel loss like this ever again after Suzanne and now it’s happened again. “I am crying myself to sleep tonight – that’s if I can sleep. “We will bring you home Joe, don’t you worry, and we will give you a huge send-off.

The 63-year-old\u0027s mouth was inseminated by sperm after she ate the undercooked seafood without removing its internal organs, researchers say.  When doctors examined the woman, they discovered 12 small, white spindle-shaped, bug-like sperm bags embedded in her tongue and gums. The foreign bodies were identified as squid spermatophores - sperm-containing capsules - belonging to a Japanese flying squid, or Todarodes pacificus. The woman had reportedly failed to remove the squid\u0027s internal organs, and compounded the problem by parboiling the creature for a few seconds before eating it.  That means the spermatophores remained alive and well. It is thought they were looking for a soft place to embed when they settled in her tongue and gums. The woman, from South Korea, needed immediate medical assistance after the sperm inseminated her mouth, according to the report in the Journal of Parasitology. Researchers for the study wrote: “As soon as she put a piece into her mouth, she felt like many \u0027bugs\u0027 were biting her oral mucosa. She experienced severe sharp pain and spat out the entire portion without swallowing. Despite that, she could feel many small squirming white bug-like organisms penetrating her oral mucosa.” The researchers went on to say they were not sure how the spermatophores managed to implant themselves into the woman’s mouth.

From learners on the motorway to stricter MOTs, there\u0027s a lot to take in. We\u0027ve teamed up with the experts at Halfords to give Mirror readers the lowdown on everything you need to know. Our team have been through the official information and below are some of the most important things to remember. Get your car in shape before the MOT   The new rules for MOTs introduced this month mean that there are new categorisation for problems. The new MOT system uses the following classifications: * Dangerous : this is a fail and you are not allowed to drive the car. * Major : this is a fail but you can drive to a garage to have the issue fixed. * Minor : the car has passed but there are issues that need fixing. The car isn\u0027t dangerous or polluting the environment. * Advisory : the car has passed but the issue could become more serious in future - monitor and repair if necessary * Meet the standard: the car meets the minimum legal standard - make sure it continues to meet the standard. If you get ‘major’ or ‘dangerous’ then you\u0027ll fail. Dangerous faults must be repaired before you can drive the car again. Major faults mean that you could drive the car to a garage for repairs as long as the car has time left on the existing MOT. Advisory still exists as a category too, so you need to keep a close eye on these. You\u0027ll still pass, but it\u0027s likely that these will become more serious with time.  You can check your car in advance for common MOT fails before you take it to be tested. Doing this means you should be able to fix problems before your test. You can also book a Free Car Check at Halfords which includes:  Bulb Check Wiper Blades Check Battery Check Engine oil level check Windscreen Chip Check Plus Free Screenwash Top Up   It can be somewhat complicated working out what oil you need to buy for your car. (The Mobil Super 3000 , for example, is best suited to engines that have been designed to use a low viscosity (HTHS) motor oil.) The Halfords Oil Finder will tell you all you need to know - just pop in your car details and it will give you suitable oil for topping up. Once you\u0027re ready for your MOT, book with Halfords Autocentre for a 45 per cent discount on the DVSA maximum fee. Common MOT failures  Because the MOT now tests for some new things you\u0027ll want to check these before taking your car in. You must make sure that your tyres are properly inflated. Warning lights on your dashboard that indicate a problem with your brakes are also a reason for the car to fail too, so check for these. Contaminated brake fluid will also be a fail from now on too as will any leaks that pose an environmental risk – like oil from the engine or gearbox. If your car has headlight washers then they must work on cars registered from September 1, 2009. Many MOT fails are quite simple problems to fix. So make sure that you have no chips or cracks in your windscreen. If you do, consider Halfords weRepair service, which will fix a chip for just \u0026pound25 at a time that suits you. It\u0027s also common to fail for a blown car bulb, so check these before you book in a test. Halfords can supply bulbs for all makes and models of car. If you\u0027re not sure if you can fit them yourself – and they can sometimes be very awkward – Halfords will do it for you and it only costs \u0026pound8 for a headlight or \u0026pound5 for other lights. The WeFit service also covers wiper blade fitting from \u0026pound2 or a battery from \u0026pound15. Cars registered for the first time after 1 March 2018 will also need to have working daytime running lights. These cars won’t go through the MOT process until 2021 though, so this is something to be aware of in the future and to add to your pre-MOT checklist. Beware using a phone for navigation  The law on using a mobile is clear: don\u0027t do it. Fines are stiff so don\u0027t take risks here and get a car holder for your phone. The Halfords One Touch Car Mount , above, is priced from \u0026pound8. The fine on the other hand could be as much as \u0026pound1,000 if you go to court, or \u0026pound200 with six points if you\u0027re given a fixed penalty notice. Bear in mind too that you can also get three points if you have an obstructed view of the road. That means you need to take care when mounting your sat nav or mobile phone holder – check this Halfords blog post for more detail. Don’t be tempted to play with your phone when driving. Even when in a mount it’s not legal to do so.  If you want to avoid the risks of having a phone to distract you then a sat nav is an ideal way to stay focused but still get directions. Modern sat navs also feature alerts about heavy traffic and the Garmin Drive , above, even has lifetime map updates, so you\u0027ll never go down a street the wrong way because of out-of-date maps. The Garmin Drive is just \u0026pound79 too (save \u0026pound20).

The horrific gun attack just before 7am on Tuesday came as the dad of ring legend Katie was starting his morning “boot camp” at Bray Boxing Club in County Wicklow south of Dublin.  A source said Brit Mr Taylor was putting on music to begin the session when there was a knock on the door.  Bobby Messett, 50, answered and was gunned down by the masked killer, reports the Irish Mirror.  As the firing continued, Ian Britton, 35, and 57-year-old Mr Taylor were also hit.  An off-duty firefighter suffered a head injury as he fled. One theory being explored by police is Mr Taylor was the intended target by a man with a grudge. A source said: “Bobby was shot only because he answered the door.” Mr Taylor, who no longer trains his daughter, was then struck in the arm and the bullet travelled into his chest. He was saved by paramedics and is recovering in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, where he is awaiting surgery. Mr Britton suffered at least three gunshot wounds to the legs and was seen by a witness stumbling out the boxing club with blood pouring from his wounds.  He was also brought to St Vincent’s. The fireman was treated as walking wounded. The gunman then fled in a Volkswagen Caddy van with Northern Ireland plates and remains at large. It was later found intact by gardai at Pigeon House Road, South Dublin. It is expected to yield significant DNA evidence. It is likely to have been picked up on traffic and CCTV cameras from Bray to Dublin. A spokesman said: “It is believed this van travelled from Bray through Shankill and the Cornelscourt area before being abandoned on Pigeon House Road at approximately 8.05am where a male was seen leaving the van and cycling away.” Mr Messett, a father and grandfather, was a well-known fitness enthusiast, who was also involved with Bray Wheelers Cycling Club. A witness, who did not want to be named, told the Irish Mirror of the moment he saw a man staggering from the gym.  He said: “It was chaos – everybody just ran to a beach. I heard shots, didn’t see a car. “I saw this man stumbling out – he was lying at the edge of the bridge on his back. He was being treated. I heard screaming and shouting. “I’ve never seen a guy shot before – the amount of blood was minimal but you could definitely see two holes.” At the scene, clothing and a bloodied training shoe lay abandoned. Forensic experts carried out minute examinations and a divisional search team formed a line and combed the area with fingertip searches. Mr Taylor’s Mustang car was parked outside the gym along with a second Audi with its licence plate covered by an evidence bag. Supt Pat Ward, who is leading the investigation, said: “About 15 people in the gym were just about to start their session when somebody opened fire.  Three people received gunshot wounds, unfortunately a 50-year-old man died at the scene. “Two others were brought to hospital. The gunman fled and we believe he left in a silver Volkswagen Caddy – we don’t know if he was accompanied by a driver or anybody else with him. “He [the gunman] was wearing some kind of head gear, that may have been dark in colour – a balaclava or helmet and could have been wearing a worker’s type hi-visibility vest. He drove towards Bray town centre, possibly on the Seapoint Road in Bray. “There are possible sightings on the main street, Dublin Road, Bray.  “He could have travelled that direction going from the gym here, Bray town centre and out to Dublin city centre. “Our local units are being assisted by the NBCI and we are carrying out the normal investigative steps in an incident of this nature.” “We are particularly interested in talking to anyone in this area – it is a leisure area.

appointed in November, he’s stressed the need for a pristine pitch to match the passing style he wants from the Tangerines.And while last season the surface was the envy of most of their second-tier rivals, the board have stumped up five figures to make sure it’s even better next term and beyond.They announced this week the existing turf has been lifted and a process known as vertical sand-banding started.While that’s a complicated, as well as expensive, process, the new and improved pitch will be ready when the first of the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the tunnel at the Eddie Thompson Stand end of Tannadice.And, while most of the budget for the next 12 months is going on putting together a squad capable of winning promotion, chairman Mike Martin is viewing the pitch project as a sound investment.“We are investing in our on and off-field operations in a structured way with every aspect of our work designed to deliver improvement throughout the club,” he said.“In this case, we aim to make sure that Tannadice

24-year-old Rogers is one name on their list of possible additions.New York born and an American citizen, Rogers was capped nine times at U/21 level for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualifies through his Irish mother.He’s only played a handful of games for the Dons in six years at Pittodrie, but has over 100 top-team appearances under his belt during loan spells at Airdrie, Dumbarton and Falkirk.Most of those games came during a two-year spell with Falkirk between 2015 and 2017.He recently signed a two-year contract extension but could be available on loan again.Deniz, meanwhile, is now likely to have the operation to repair knee ligament damage next week.It was scheduled for early last week but the surgeon in England decided to delay it because the joint he damaged against Dunfermline in the play-offs last month remained swollen.He’s likely to be out until around the turn of the year.The Tangerines, meanwhile, have confirmed the signing of young Celtic defender Sam Wardrop and it’s understood Dunfermline’s Fraser Aird will be revealed as another member of the squad over the next few days.A deal for Wardrop was agreed with the Hoops last week and the 20-year-old

I remember there were discussions in recent years to reduce the number of gulls.“Judging by these images I can’t see any justification that any such steps have been taken to cull the gulls or remove eggs from nests.“You just need to look at the roof next to the casino and the gym you can see hundreds of them at any time.”Lynne Short, city development convener, said: “I will be in contact with the refuse teams to survey the bins as it appears the current provisions aren’t adequate enough.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “Bins have been provided in many areas where, previously, waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Pest control officers are involved in removing eggs and nests throughout breeding season, and while this greatly reduces incidences of aggressive behaviour and disrupts and reduces the breeding pattern, it can take between five and seven years to take hold.“Gulls are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.“It allows for the destruction of birds under certain circumstances, but this is only permissible where it can be demonstrated that they pose a risk to public safety or public health, and only when all other non-lethal methods of control have been discounted.“We would also ask that people do not feed gulls as this only exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

I modified a design someone had uploaded to the internet as I thought it was just about perfect for him.“All I had to do was personalise it for the size of Bruce after I measured him, I then used a programme to design a buggy for his body with the correct width of the arc for the front wheels so as not to interfere with his poorly legs.“I get a lot of pleasure from being able to help people with anything they may need designed from a new door nameplate to the wheels for Bruce, you imagine it and I will try to build it, you are only limited by your imagination.“I did see a big difference when I saw him after a week and I think we are just about there.”In addition to both of his front legs being dislocated, Bruce also has underdeveloped joints and non- cancerous tumours in his eyes as well as having stunted growth.He has received daily massages and hydrotherapy treatment – sometimes up to three times a day – in a bid to increase his strength.Bruce was so small on arriving at their home that he could fit into the palm of Robyn’s hand.His wheels – complete with his very own nameplate – were created through a 3D printer with the design meaning Robyn and mum Jayne Kelly can have it adjusted should Bruce grow out of it.Robyn, Jayne and other family members have been out to meet Colin several times so Bruce could test out the prototype.This was the first time that Colin, of Polepark, had designed a prototype for an animal.His creation is now available on free design-sharing website Thingverse, with hundreds of people showing an interest in adapting his work.Colin said: “I’m normally used to working with humans and altering wheelchairs, which I’ve done for about 20 years.“This was the first time I’ve done anything for animals and it’s something I would happily do again if the opportunity came up. It took a couple of trials to get it almost perfect and after a couple of weeks I found a third wheel at the back to stabilise him was ideal.“The advantage of 3D printing is that if he does grow any more it is easy to change the size and print a replacement and the current model is configurable so I can adjust the height later.“I’ve spent about four to five years working with 3D printing and I’ve definitely seen a big difference in the quality of the designs that I’ve been able to come up with.“I’m just glad I was able to help Bruce improve and it’s been quite pleasing to see the reaction that I’ve had to the design.“It means that people can now go and adapt it however they like and to suit whatever situation.“Hopefully that will go some way to making a difference.”VIDEO: Adorable pup Bruce shows off his custom made wheels after being saved by Dundee family\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/5a0d808493e8c.jpg ","title":"volunteers needed to provide debt advice to dundees poorest folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Christian charity is calling on parishioners in Dundee to volunteer as debt advisers to help the city’s poorest families.Community Money Advice, which supports church-run advice centres throughout Britain, will host a Debt in Dundee event at 11am next Tuesday at the Steeple on Nethergate.The event is open to church leaders and volunteers, and will discuss the debt crisis and how it can be tackled.Stephen Curran, manager of CMA’s Scottish affiliate Community Money Advice Scotland (CMAS), said: “We value the excellent advice already on offer locally through Dundee City Council, Dundee Citizens Advice Bureau and others.“And we recognise the work of St Peter’s Free Church leading a Christians Against Poverty debt centre in partnership with Broughty Ferry Baptist Church, Grace Church in Menzieshill and Hillbank Evangelical Church in the Hilltown.Any effort we are able to encourage through other Dundee churches will complement not compete with existing services.“The need for additional support is clear.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition.

signing Chris Forrester today vowed to be an influential goal-scoring playmaker – starting in Europe.The midfielder became Dons boss Derek McInnes’ first major signing of the summer when signing a three-year contract from Peterborough United.Rated as a multi-million star by Peterborough only 18 months ago, the Dons secured the 25-year-old for a fee understood to be £200,0000.Former Posh captain Forrester had a year left on his contract at Peterborough but was slapped on the transfer list at the end of the season by Steve Evans.The midfielder is a former Republic of Ireland U21 cap and broke into the senior squad in 2016 but has still to be capped.Dons boss Derek McInnes’ main priority in the transfer window was to replace the void left by the exit of Kenny McLean.Scotland cap McLean was the Reds’ main midfield playmaker but has left Pittodrie for Championship side Norwich City.Forrester insists he can bring that creative spark McInnes is searching for and aims to hit the ground running in the Europa League.He said: “I am not afraid to get on the ball as that is what I love to do.“I love to get the game going and passing to the lads that can maybe score the goals.“This season I want to be the one receiving the ball, doing something with it and also scoring a few goals.“In the last two seasons at Peterborough I forgot how to find the goal.“Coming up here one of my main aims is to get back in amongst the goals.“I aim to be a goal scoring midfielder as opposed to someone just sitting in the middle and passing the ball.“I want to see myself up there pressing the ball and creating the assists or creating the goal that wins the game.”Aberdeen had also made an enquiry about Forrester’s Peterborough team-mate Jack Baldwin.However, the Reds cooled their interest in the defender.Forrester revealed boss McInnes was pivotal in persuading him to move to Pittodrie.He said: “He (McInnes) said he sees me as an important player for the team which is music to my ears.“He said he sees me coming into the team and being the main passer which is what I liked to hear.“That helped to bring me here.”Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round stage on July 26.Despite playing in England’s third tier, Forrester has no concerns about making his Dons debut on the continental stage.He played in Europe for both Bohemians and St Patrick’s Athletic from the League of Ireland.He said: “My first European trip was with Bohemians when I was 18 and we went to Slovenia to play Ljubljana (Olimpija).“That was a massive experience for me and I did that every year I was in the League of Ireland.“For about five years I went on European trips and had some great results.“We (St Patrick’s Athletic) knocked out Siroki Brijeg (of Bosnia, 3-2 aggregate in 2012).“We also played Legia Warsaw which was a massive game in front of a massive crowd.“We were 1-0 up until the scored an equalizer in the 89th minute (1-1 first leg, 5-0 second for 6-1 aggregate loss).“I have plenty of experience in Europe and hopefully can bring that to the team this season.”Forrester was so highly rated Peterborough club chairman valued him as a multi-million pound player in January 2016.However, after a frustrating season he was transfer listed this summer with a year left on his Posh deal.Forrester said: “As soon as my agent told me about the interest from Aberdeen I knew that I needed a fresh start from Peterborough.“Things didn’t go so well last season.“I could see Aberdeen get over 15,000 at games most weeks and it is a club with stature.“I am looking forward

reputation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe boss of the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has said that he believes the development could “change the history” of the city.Speaking during a boat visit to the new wind farm, also known as the European Offshore Wind Development Centre (EOWDC), Vattenfall project director Adam Ezzamel said that he wants the project to change Aberdeen from a traditional “oil and gas hub” to a city known for renewable energy.Once hooked up to the grid, the new wind farm will supply enough electricity to power 80,000 homes, with one turn of a turbine powerful enough to supply an average house with enough electricity for an entire day.Mr Ezzamel said: “This project is all about transferring Aberdeen from an oil hub to a global energy hub with Scotland’s largest test and demonstration centre.\u0026#8220It’s a power station in its own right that will be powering more than 70% of Aberdeen’s domestic electricity demand on an annual basis.”“We have borrowed technology from the oil and gas industry and put it into the renewables industry.\u0026#8220This development can really change the way people think about Aberdeen.”Mr Ezzamel also said yesterday that he believes the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm to be the fastest built offshore wind development in Scotland’s history.The wind farm boasts some of the most powerful turbines in the world thanks to an innovative suction bucket foundation which has been sunk into the sands off Aberdeen Bay.With the project taking just nine weeks from first foundation to final turbine, Mr Ezzamel believes it is “surely” the fastest build of a wind farm off Scotland’s shores.He said: “I’ve looked hard for counter examples, but none are forthcoming. It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used. I can’t see anything else being quicker.”Vattenfall installation manager Alistair Leighton agrees: “One installation only took two hours and forty minutes and we’ve got vessels that can lay the field very quickly.Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has embraced all sorts of new technology and some of that was really familiar to people who traditionally work in oil and gas.“There’s so much scope for skills to be transferred from oil and gas to renewable energy in the north-east.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"speed checks in new drive for road safety","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice have carried out a number of speed checks at locations across the north-east as part of an ongoing initiative to make roads safer.Officers visited a number of areas in South Aberdeenshire as part of the operation.These included Cookston Road in Portlethen and the A937 on the Marykirk to Laurencekirk road.The checks took place on Wednesday and Thursday last week.Officers have also been working alongside community councils to identify areas that are known for speeding and antisocial behaviour.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen.

While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

Children from Ballantrae Primary are set to relocate to Girvan Primary following a major fire at the village school yesterday evening. It is believed that around 30 firefighters were called to the blaze at 8.38pm on Monday.  The fire – contained within the main school building – caused extensive damage to the existing classroom and early years provision at the school. A new extension, which is currently under construction, was unaffected. Fifty-eight P1-P7 children are expected to make the move to Girvan Primary from Thursday, June 7, once suitable arrangements are in place to transport pupils and staff.  Plans are also underway to relocate the 13 early years children to Ballantrae Community Centre, keeping them within the local community. The intention is to introduce the changes for the early years centre from Monday, June 11 however, this will be subject to finalising arrangements with both Ballantrae Community Association and the Care Inspectorate, who will need to register the centre before it can be used. A drop-in session will be held at Ballantrae Community Centre between 4pm-6pm tomorrow (Wednesday) to update parents/carers and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. Councillor William Grant, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Lifelong Learning, said: “This is a really sad end to the school year at Ballantrae Primary and I know it will have affected everyone in this tight-knit community. “I’m pleased we have been able to move so quickly to put alternative arrangements in place for children and staff, keeping the loss of education time to an absolute minimum, which is a positive outcome.  “And my thanks to everyone involved in achieving this, especially colleagues at Girvan Primary and Ballantrae Community Centre. “At this time it’s too early for us to have a clear picture of the extent of the damage to the school building and the work that will be involved to bring it back into use. “However, there’s no doubt interim education arrangements will need to run well into the new school year and it could be many months before pupils can return. “Our priority will be to maintain quality learning and teaching for our children during this time and that’s what we will focus on.” Ballantrae Primary’s Head Teacher, Yvonne Templeton, added: “We’re all devastated by what’s happened and really can’t believe it. “Our school is very much at the heart of the community in Ballantrae and I know this will have an impact on everyone not just within the school, but right across our village. “However, we can all be grateful that no one was hurt in the fire. “My focus will be on supporting our children, staff, parents and carers while we’re decanted from the school we know and love, but I know we’ll take the spirit and ethos of Ballantrae Primary wherever we are.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12651122.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_310518bella_03JPG.jpg","title":"bella mani boss claims beauty","story":"NewsBella Mani boss claims beauty empire is safe despite tax collectors swooping inBella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"gym group set open 24","story":"NewsThe Gym Group set to open 24 hour facilities in AyrThe group which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:26, 5 JUN 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 24-hour gym is to become the newest tenant at Ayr’s Heathfield Retail Park, as the firm’s expansion across Scotland continues. The Gym Group, which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019. It comes just a week after fellow new investors, Wren Kitchens, announced their intention to take up residence in the park later this year. Heathfield, a 190,000sq ft park, is to lose more than a third of its live trading space in the coming months as names such as Homebase, Carpetright and Maplin bow out. But Alistair Dickie, of the park’s development firm Ediston Properties, insists the quick capture of new tenants has proved there remains plenty of potential for the future. He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.   But he pointed out the Bible said women who commit adultery should be stoned, which people would be horrified by.  He added: “Jesus has a bias towards the downtrodden and excluded.”  And he appealed for same-sex couples and gay people in the congregation to “stick with us”. He added: “I am aware of your hurt and disappointment, as I acknowledge mine, but it is amazing what can happen when people pray and try to see what it really feels like from another person’s perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Foul-mouthed supermarket worker ordered to pay compensation to colleagues","story":"A FOUL-mouthed supermarket worker has been ordered to pay compensation to four colleagues at a local store after subjecting them to abusive and offensive remarks.\nTwenty seven year old Toyah Chetwynd also made abusive comments about them on social media.\nShe pleaded guilty to a charge of threatening or abusive behaviour at Sainsbury\u0027s in Hawick on February 6.\nProcurator fiscal Graham Fraser said that Chetwynd was on long-term sick from the store and had been having a \"difficult relationship\" with management and colleagues.\nOn the day of the offence she turned up at Sainsburys at 5.30pm saying she wanted a meeting with management.\nMr Fraser said two supervisors took her to the training room where she called one a \"fat bitch\" and the other a \"dirty little slut\" before calming down and leaving the store.\nBut he explained that at five to nine in the evening it was noticed she was outside the store with her partner and was again being abusive towards staff .\nMr Fraser said: \"She was asked what she was doing there.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.  Caroline Brown, acting depute headteacher at the Grammar, said that the relationship between the school and the VisitScotland five-star racecourse was proving fruitful for both pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.  Heather Jarron added: \u0026ldquoMany elderly residents without cars in this village would benefit greatly from having a pharmacy.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.  His colleague Martin Whitfield MP said it was \u0026ldquoyet more evidence of the detrimental impact Universal Credit was having on vulnerable local families.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.

ITV is set to cash in on advertising revenue from both the World Cup and Love Island, which Mr Khalaf said will deliver a \u0026ldquosizzling summer for the broadcaster.  The fortunes of bookies Ladbrokes and Paddy Power Betfair will be tied to those of the England team.  \u0026ldquoA strong showing from England will keep interest and hopes high, and the further the national team progresses, the more punters are likely to bet with their hearts rather than their heads, he added.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.

There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Offering golfers the chance to improve their\u0026nbsphandicap whilst taking in the wonderful scenery, you\u0027re\u0026nbspspoiled for choice when choosing where to play. Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

However, for nearly a decade, the ground breaking arts company NVA seemed to have found new hope, and a future, for St Peter\u0027s Seminary in Cardross.  But now that future has been derailed, after the announcement that the company will close in September this year.  NVA, an acclaimed and innovative company led by creative director Angus Farquhar, will cease operations this year, months after losing out in the controversial Regular Funding decisions made by Creative Scotland, the arts funding body.  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  Last night, the culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study the former seminary, designed and built by the late Glasgow architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein in 1966, and report on its \"long term options.\"  Ms Hyslop said she would like the building to \"continue to fascinate and inspire the public\" and noted that she was \"very sad\" that NVA is to close, adding \"since its foundation 25 years ago, it has earned a reputation as one of the most innovative public arts companies.\"  The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the world\u0027s most endangered cultural landmarks.  NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in 2016, and this year have made a film with artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term \u0026pound11m project to transform the \"stablised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.  Since 2013, NVA spent \u0026pound2.3m on the building, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of 80 vaults, improving paths, clearing away invasive plants, and woodland management in the 104 acre site.  Revealed: The Mackintosh design you chose for our print giveaway  The building still belongs to the Archdiocese of Glasgow, for which a spokesman said: \"We are sorry to learn of the closure of NVA and the subsequent impact on plans to secure and develop the former St Peter\u0026rsquos College at Cardross.  \"NVA were visionary in their hopes for the college site and it is a great shame that these hopes will not now be realised.  \"The Archdiocese will now consider its options and consider any proposal to develop the site in a way which will secure the architecture of the former college and benefit the local community.\"  NVA\u0027s other works include the Hidden Gardens at the Tramway in Glasgow, The Secret Sign in Finnich Glen, a show in Central Hotel in 1999, Grand Central, and The Path in Glen Lyon in 2000.  It also staged The Storr: Unfolding Landscapes on the Isle of Skye in 2005 and Speed of Light, initially commissioned as part of the UK\u0026rsquos 2012 Cultural Olympiad.  A board statement said: \"In September of last year the trustees of NVA made the difficult decision to withdraw from the capital project plans to rescue St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary in Cardross, due to increasing risks, both financial and physical.  \"NVA\u0026rsquos original plan for St Peter\u0026rsquos was universally acknowledged as bold, with creative ambition at its heart.  \"It was also recognised as a high risk venture for a small independent arts organisation.  \"NVA has spent many years working with great passion and determination, with the support of the owners of the site, the Archdiocese of Glasgow, to save this iconic building for future generations.  \"We collaborated with public and private stakeholders, the local communities and an amazing design team.  \"Important work was done to begin to preserve and restore the building and to demonstrate the immense creative, intellectual and community potential of the site.\"  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  However, it adds: \"Despite our best efforts we were unable to guarantee the viable future for the St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary that we had imagined and hoped for. In the end, we had no choice but to bring the capital project to an end.\"  NVA said it has tried to develop an \"alternative proposal\" for the site, but this has not proved possible and \"has reinforced the many financial and structural challenges facing the company.\"  The board said that NVA is now \"not able to continue\".  A Creative Scotland spokeswoman said: \"NVA has been one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most creatively ambitious companies, producing ground-breaking work that has attracted national and international attention, including their ambitious plans for St. Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary.  \"We appreciate how difficult this decision has been for the Board and staff of NVA and will continue to offer support and advice to all those involved.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Young influencers in Edinburgh digital tourism push","story":"              ONLINE influencers are being recruited to help boost young traveller numbers to Edinburgh.

A survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) found 58 per cent were \u0026ldquounlikely to endorse a career in teaching. Only two per cent would be \u0026ldquovery likely to do so.  The greatest concern was spiralling workload with 85 per cent saying it had increased in the past year - despite a pledge by John Swinney, the Education Secretary, to tackle the problem.  Read more: John Swinney\u0027s war on workload a long way from being won  Changes to the curriculum were seen as a key area of dissatisfaction while teacher shortages and stagnant pay were also highlighted.  The findings comes after a sustained period of upheaval in education with significant changes to the curriculum and associated exams.  Schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit staff in some subjects creating additional work for the remaining staff.  Concerns of individual teachers were also included in the EIS survey with one stating: \u0026ldquoThe curriculum becomes more cluttered every year ... everything taught at a rushed and superficial pace.  Another said: \u0026ldquoStaffing shortages have created a significant increase in workload.  Teachers said the fall in the number of support staff to deal with children with conditions such as autism and dyslexia was creating extra pressure.  Another said: \u0026ldquoWorkload has reached a point that it significantly impacts on my home life.  \u0026ldquoI have less time with my family and feel more stressed. I am so tired at the end of the school day and then have more work to do at home. It is depressing.  Read more: Workload blamed for teacher exodus  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, described the survey results as \u0026ldquoworrying reading.  \u0026ldquoDespite statements from the Scottish Government, local authorities and national education bodies that promised action to tackle excessive levels of teacher workload, the results of our survey indicate little has improved and some difficulties actually seems to have grown worse, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe have frequently been told that meaningful pay rises are unaffordable, but that extra teachers are being employed and that workload is being tackled.  \u0026ldquoThese survey results confirm that teachers are seeing little improvement, and that severe pressure continues to be piled onto our overworked, undervalued and underpaid teachers.  Opposition parties blamed the Scottish Government for the concerns.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour said: \u0026ldquoScotland has thousands fewer teachers since the SNP came to power, and with most professionals not recommending the job it could get even worse.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time John Swinney restored teachers\u0026rsquo pay and gave our children the resources they need to succeed in school.

Food giant Heinz is set to ditch the famous name for the first time in 104 years claiming that as only 14 per cent of buyers actually used the gloopy white sauce on salads, the old name no longer reflects its modern purpose.  A spokesman for Heinz said that the name no longer \"fairly represents the product\u0027s ingredients or usage occasions.\"  Parent group Kraft Heinz said it was working with brand design specialists Jones Knowles Ritchie on overhauling one of Britain\u0027s longest running kitchen staples.  It would be the first name change for the product since its launch in 1914.    Fans of the traditional name went on social media to express their anger.  It is believed Heinz is considering adopting the name Sandwich Cream to better reflect how the country uses the condiment and to appeal to \"younger shoppers\".  UK sales of the brand dipped 5.4 per cent to \u0026pound28.8 million last year.  A Heinz spokesman added: \"As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers.  \"There are consumers now who haven\u0027t grown up with the brand in the household and just don\u0027t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.\"  The consultation process means the earliest a new name will be introduced is in September.    The condiment became a national favourite during the 1940s, Heinz says, when ketchup was unavailable and salad cream was used to add flavour to bland war-time rations.  In 1999, it was revealed that Heinz were about to ditch the brand but once the leak was published it led to a major protest by shoppers and it saved the brand.  The publicity helped sales and Heinz took advantage by relaunching Salad Cream in new-look packs and putting the price up."},{"url":null,"title":"UK Government defends RBS shares sale at   2 1bn loss  saying it s  value for money ","story":"              THE UK Government has defended the sale of a 7.7 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at a \u0026pound2.1 billion loss to the UK taxpayer, insisting it was \"value for money\".  Lord Bates, the Treasury spokesman, dismissed criticism of the move from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords.  Answering an urgent question, he said the sale would raise \u0026pound2.5bn, representing \"value for money for the taxpayer\".  The Conservative peer said RBS was a \"smaller, simpler and safer organisation\" than the one the Government was forced to recapitalise in 2008 at a cost to the taxpayer of \u0026pound46bn and the sale price reflected that \"reality\".  But Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer demanded: \"Why sell now crystallising a loss that rises to in excess of \u0026pound3bn when financing costs are included and when there is no pressure..?\"  She warned that by acting now the Government could be selling shares on an \"inaccurate prospectus, ignoring growing allegations that liabilities to those abused by RBS\u0027s global restructuring group... are inadequately quantified, not declared and not provided for within the accounts\".  But Lord Bates said that when the Government paid 502p per share in 2008 it was an \"essential injection of capital\" at a time of financial crisis the bank was now, he insisted, in a very different organisation.  Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said the shares were being sold at a \"massive level below\" the 2008 bailout with the taxpayer bearing the cost and leaving the public to \"lose on the deal significantly\".  Lord Bates hit back, telling him: \"You may say we sold it too cheaply. I might say that you bought it too high.\"  He said the price was \"near the top end of the yearly average\" and the Government had signalled it shouldn\u0027t be in the business of \"running these banks\".  Tory former Cabinet minister Lord King of Bridgwater backed the sale as being an \"entirely sensible procedure to bring in some money while we can\".  Lord Bates said the Opposition was forgetting what the situation was in 2008 and the \"incredible damage done to our economy, which we are still having to clear up\".  He said the sale proceeds would go directly to reduce the debt accumulated in 2008.  Outwith Parliament, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister when the bank was bailed out, said there was \"no excuse\" for selling the shares at under their potential value.  Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, also insisted there was no need to sell the RBS shares now.  \u0026ldquoThere was no need for the Conservatives to cost the taxpayer more than \u0026pound2bn, he declared.  \"There is continuing uncertainty on a number of RBS\u0026rsquo legacy issues. Ministers should instead have been using their position as the biggest shareholder to make sure management put the bank in order so that the share price recovered before selling any of the stake,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland s last great auk to be immortalised in bronze","story":"              STANDING three feet tall, with a curved black beak and glossy black and white feathers, it was one of the most impressive birds ever to call Scotland its home.  The great auk was the country\u0026rsquos answer to the penguin \u0026ndash large, flightless and ungainly on land, yet fast and agile in the water. Yet in the end they became Scotland\u0026rsquos dodo, wiped out by the carelessness of men who hunted them for their meat and feathers, and doomed the species to extinction.  Today, all that remains of the great auk is their little cousins \u0026ndash puffins, razorbills and other seabirds of the same family \u0026ndash and a few preserved remains floating in jars and stuffed carcasses on museum shelves.  Now preparations are being made to commemorate one of the final members of the species to be killed in Scotland with a bronze replica.  The great auk was one of a pair which nested on the Orkney island of Papa Westray, and met its demise at the hands of hunters in 1813. Six years later, in 1819, the bird\u0026rsquos stuffed remains were purchased by the Natural History Museum, and it is only British specimen in existence.  A clay statue was made of the bird to mark the spot where it had been shot, at Fowl Crag, on the north of the island, but this was damaged in a recent storm and lost its head. Although it has been repaired, the replica is only 10in tall and plans are being made to use scans which were taken of its stuffed remains to have a life-size version made in bronze. Jonathan Ford, the ranger on Papa Westray who repaired the damaged clay version, said that a new statue would be a fitting tribute to one of the last great auks of Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll always keep the original statue \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a lot of history with it and it\u0026rsquos got a long association with the island. But the bronze statue would be life-size and a model of the actual bird which was taken from here, so it would be like it is coming home. They used to be widespread on Papa Westray, and it is very sad that the last ones were driven into extinction.  Great auks ranged over much of the north Atlantic for thousands of years and could be found nesting in crags and cliffs from America to Europe.  Used as a food source, their remains have been found in sites that were home to Neanderthals in Gibraltar 100,000 years ago, while early humans daubed their images on cave walls 35,000 years ago.  One great auk bone dating from the fifth century was uncovered recently near the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick, indicating they were also eaten by medieval Scots.  However, they were hunted relentlessly in the 18th and 19th century as European ships spread out across the globe, with sailors using them as living larders they could pack on to boats. Their feathers, which were rich with oil, were also highly prized both as a fuel source and by the down industry as filling for quilts.  Tales have come down from the era of great auks being herded on to boats in large flocks, or used as fuel on treeless islands because they burned so easily.  Their persecution was famously cruel, with hunters advised to strip their feathers while the birds were still alive before leaving them to perish from the elements.  Britain banned the killing of the bird in 1794, except by fishermen. But by then it was too late.  The final great auk found in the British Isles is said to have been taken on a sea stack off of St Kilda, by fishermen hunting gannets.  They tied its feet and took it onboard their boat, only to become superstitious and fearful a few days later during a storm. Believing the bird to be \u0026ldquoa maelstrom-conjuring witch, they beat it to death. The last known great auks were killed on the island of Elday, off the coast of Iceland, by sailors hunting them for a museum collector in 1844.  Scottish Seabird Centre chief executive, Tom Brock said: \u0026ldquoThe really important thing is it reminds us that animals are still going extinct, even in Scotland. We should not take them for granted. One of the great auk\u0026rsquos close relatives, the puffin, has been put on to the red endangered list.  \u0026ldquoWe must protect and conserve safeguard seabird populations or more species will go the same way as the great auk."},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn to push for  new single market  deal in crunch Commons vote","story":"              LABOUR is to push for a \"new single market\" deal for the UK after Brexit as the UK Government faces crunch votes in the Commons next week.  Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s frontbench has tabled amendments to the Brexit Bill, which would call on Theresa May to make maintaining \"full access\" to the EU \"internal market\" an objective of the negotiations with Brussels.

The Opposition\u0026rsquos move - which has been tabled as an alternative to the Lords amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill - is aimed at delivering the same benefits as single market membership.  Mr Corbyn said: \"We are confident we can build a new relationship with the EU. We want the UK to have a better deal than the Norway model.\"  It is understood Labour MPs will abstain on the Lords EEA amendment but will be asked to back the party\u0027s call for a \"bespoke\" deal which would see shared UK-EU institutions and regulations.  Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, said: \"Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.  \"Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result.  \"Existing single market agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries, including Norway, are bespoke deals negotiated with the EU to serve the best interests of those countries.  \"We need to learn from them and negotiate our own more ambitious agreement, which serves our economic interests and which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland.

In a sign that some Labour MPs will still push for full single market membership, Chuka Umunna - a supporter of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign - said: \"All the way through the passage of this Bill, the only amendments which have commanded support on both sides of the House and passed are cross-party backbench ones.  \"So, if we are serious about \u0027protecting full access to the internal market of the EU\u0027 and ensuring \u0027no new impediments to trade\u0027, logic dictates Labour MPs should be whipped to support the cross-party EEA amendment sent to us by the House of Lords.\"  Theresa May will seek to overturn the changes to her flagship Brexit legislation introduced in the Lords in a showdown in the Commons next week.  Without an overall majority, the Prime Minister is expected to spend the coming days trying to sweet-talk and strong-arm potential rebels who could inflict defeat on some of the Government\u0027s key Brexit positions.  In response to Labour\u0026rsquos amendment, Suella Braverman, the Brexit Minister, said: \"Labour have shattered their promise to respect the referendum result this amendment means accepting free movement and continuing to follow EU rules with absolutely no say in them, which is the worst of all worlds.  \"Only the Conservatives will get the best deal for the whole country - delivering on the referendum vote to get control of our money, borders and laws, while building a strong new relationship with Europe.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspPoll suggests anti-Brexit feeling at highest level since aftermath of 2016 referendum  Stephen Gethins for the SNP said: \"Any Brexit scenario is damaging but remaining in the single market and customs union would be the least worst option to protect the economy, jobs and livelihoods.  \"Labour need to quit playing games and do the right thing support the UK\u0027s continued membership of the single market and customs union,\" added the Fife MP.  Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, accused Mr Corbyn and Mrs May of being involved in \u0026ldquosome bizarre contest as to which of them could be the most misleading to the British public about the consequences of Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThe amendments tabled by the Labour Party are proof, if proof is needed, that Jeremy Corbyn is far from being the brave defender of the pro-EU cause that he would have us believe.

The Hidden Gardens, behind the Tramway in Glasgow\u0027s south side, still stands.  And in the last ten years the small arts charity, led by Angus Farquhar - who previously had been in the industrial music group Test Department - also wrought significant change at St Peter\u0027s Seminary. For NVA to take on, and try to transform, the modern ruin, did always seem like an ambitious, perhaps extraordinary, task.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScottish arts firm to close this year and abandons plans to restore St Peters  The company did begin work on its project to breathe new life into the ruin: deadly asbestos was cleared, the vaults were stabilised, and thousands of invasive rhododendron bushes have been removed. But ultimately, without a major national institution to step in (which, at some point, perhaps NVA was half expecting to happen) and provide funding, scale and stability, the project proved too much. The public money that was raised for the project and not used was paid back last year. The company will close without lurching into bankruptcy, I am told. But NVA is over, and who knows if art work like Speed of Light or The Path in Glen Lyon will be attempted again.  What cannot be lost in the closure of NVA is the role of Creative Scotland, the nation\u0027s arts funder. In January, in the Regular Funding round which has been the cause of much controversy and debate, NVA were not granted regular funding. It had been funded before. At the time it seemed a surprising decision, but was somewhat lost in the tumult surrounding similar decisions in theatre and music. Mr Farquhar, too, did not - at least in public - kick up much of a fuss. Perhaps he was politic to do so. However, when Creative Scotland made a series of U-turns on its cuts, NVA was not among the reprieved.

It was rather moving, and brought home the extent to which the metropolis truly is a multicultural city. It\u0026rsquos sometimes hard to believe that the indigenous white population is still in a majority here.  Step off the train back in Scotland and you are in a different world. Scotland remains a conspicuously white nation. Indeed, the most visible social difference now between Scotland and England today is arguably not nationality, but race. Despite a significant increase in immigration in the past decade, Black And Minority Ethnic \u0026ndash BAME \u0026ndash still really means that: minority. In the last census there were only around 40,000 Afro-Carribbeans recorded as living in the whole of Scotland.  Which makes it doubly ludicrous that the Home Office seems determined to expel those few who make it here, such as the student nurse, Denzel Darku. He has lost two appeals against deportation on the grounds that he cannot prove he is dependent on his father, who lives in Edinburgh and is an EU citizen. This is typical of the Catch-22 rules that have grown up like a dense thicket around our immigration law since Theresa May introduced her \u0026ldquohostile environment to migrants five years ago.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It makes no sense that this capable and responsible young man, who was a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament and carried the Queen\u0026rsquos Baton at the Commonwealth Games, is likely to be deported after his final appeal next week. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday that he was \u0026ldquosympathetic, but this will cut little ice with the hard-faced men and women of the British immigration service, for whom \u0026ldquocomputer says no is the whole of the law.  It is often said that hostility to immigration grows in inverse proportion to the number of immigrants actually living in a given area. Hence, diverse London voted for Remain, while Brexit, and Ukip, are stronger in white English townships. But that rule doesn\u0026rsquot seem to apply to Scotland. There is racism if you care to look for it, of course. But it is obvious from the composition of the Scottish Parliament that race and immigration are not significant political issues in Scotland. You rarely see those \u0026ldquoMigrant Crisis front pages that have disgraced English news-stands in recent years because newspaper readers don\u0026rsquot buy them.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions in Holyrood, the Scottish parties united to jeer and goad Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Tories when they failed to voice support for the First Minister in her defence of Mr Darku. Some Tory MSPs allegedly cried \u0026ldquosend him home, which to me seems most unlikely because casual hostility to immigrants is not tolerated in Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party. Woe betide the Scottish Tory councillor who makes even a daft joke about immigrants. To be fair to the Conservatives, they have never seriously attempted to make race and immigration an issue in Scotland, because they know there are no votes in it.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon attacks \u0027shameful\u0027 Tory silence on deportation case  Yet in England, immigration remains a massive issue that underpinned the Brexit vote, and still has politicians of all parties running scared. This week, Mrs May repeated her nonsense proposal to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands \u0026ndash a target which would be economically ruinous to Britain if it were even remotely achievable. The UK economy has benefited from immigration, largely in recent years from the European Union. Migrants invariably come to Britain to work and to pay taxes, which have helped to pay for public services and run the NHS.  Scotland needs immigrants more than the rest of the UK because our population is ageing faster than the rest of the UK. This in turn is partly because low-growth Scotland continues to lose qualified younger workers because of the lack of jobs here. This is not going to change any time soon. The Scottish Fiscal Commission has forecast that Scottish growth will remain at near-recession levels of less than one per cent for the next five years. If there are able and industrious young people who want to come to Scotland to work and contribute, like Mr Darku, we should be doing everything possible to keep them here.  It beggars belief that the UK Government doesn\u0026rsquot see this. The refusal to meet the First Minister\u0026rsquos calls for the devolution of immigration policy makes no political sense. Mrs May could undermine the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopower grab claims about the impact of the EU Withdrawal Bill, by promising a regionally-based immigration regime, such as exists in Canada or Australia. It would shoot Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos fox. She\u0026rsquod find it harder to argue that Scotland was losing out because of Brexit and Westminster insensitivity to Scottish concerns.  One suspects Mr Javid would introduce such a policy if he could, and is plainly embarrassed by UK policy as a whole. Michael Gove, the UK Environment Secretary and one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, said before the Brexit referendum that immigration was one of the powers that should come to Scotland after Brexit. All that would be necessary would be to ensure that those migrants who came to Scotland to work were recorded as living here. This will happen anyway since they now have a Scottish tax code.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It\u0026rsquos not as if the UK\u0026rsquos existing immigration policy makes any sense. Mr Javid is desperately trying to find a way of removing the Tier 2 cap that has been preventing much-needed doctors and other highly-qualified people migrating to the UK. Daft earnings requirements are denuding the NHS of nurses and other lower paid workers. It is absurd that 450,000 international students are included in the immigration statistics, since few will remain here. The Windrush scandal has visibly changed attitudes towards our racist immigration rules, which led to British citizens being deported, and others denied housing because of their colour. England needs a new immigration system as much as Scotland. Theresa May needs to overcome her fear of Ukip and let her apparently open-minded new Home Secretary create one."},{"url":null,"title":"Ken Smith  39 s Diary  Flight of fancy  Just the job and Pass the hankie","story":"              Flight of fancy  THE Government has backed the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport which has angered a number of environmental campaigners.

The annual Scottish Widows retirement report shows the number of Scots saving for retirement has risen sharply to 84%, up from 75% in 2017.  However, those saving adequately - defined as at least 12% of their income - has stagnated at 58%, down from 59% the year before.  Robert Cochran, retirement expert at Scottish Widows, said: \"While it\u0027s encouraging that more Scots are putting something aside for retirement, the fact that adequate savings levels have stagnated shows that auto-enrolment is not a silver bullet.  The report suggests the trend is expected to continue as about six in 10 Scots (59%) say it is unlikely they will be able to save more in the next year than they do now.  More than a third (35%) said the reason they are not saving more into their workplace pension is because they cannot afford to.  \"It is therefore not surprising that just three in 10 people in Scotland feel optimistic about their retirement, down from 35% last year,\" the report said.  The proportion of UK workers saving adequately for retirement has dropped slightly for the first time since 2013, falling from 56% to 55%.  Despite adequate savings rates rising by 10% since auto-enrolment, the report said a renewed effort is needed to improve the nation\u0027s readiness for retirement.  It added: \"We want to see earnings thresholds scrapped entirely at a much quicker rate, to let all workers benefit from employer contributions.  \"We\u0027d also like to see the age at which workers become auto-enrolled reduced to 18, thereby increasing the number of people who can participate in workplace pensions. \""},{"url":null,"title":"Grenfell refurbishment firms branded inhumane over    corporate cat-and-mouse   ","story":"              Firms involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower faced a barrage of criticism at the public inquiry as it was claimed \u0026ldquocorporate silence could endanger lives in future.  Several sub-contractors who worked on parts of the refit refused to comment on their work until they had full disclosure of documents, the probe was told on Tuesday.  Stephanie Barwise QC, representing survivors and the bereaved, said the move was \u0026ldquoinhumane, a view echoed by another advocate, Pete Weatherby QC, who warned them not to play \u0026ldquocat-and-mouse.  The work carried out on Grenfell Tower was criticised in withering terms by lawyers speaking on behalf of those affected.  Danny Friedman QC said Kensington and Chelsea council \u0026ldquooversaw a refurbishment of a social housing high rise tower block in such a way as to render it a death trap.  He added: \u0026ldquoThose who escaped owe their lives primarily to chance rather than risk assessment and contingency planning by either the council or the fire brigade.  Polyethylene cladding was wrapped around the west London block during the work, a material \u0026ldquonow openly described by some in the industry as petrol, his colleague Ms Barwise said.  She told the hearing at Holborn Bars that CEP, the sub-contractor which purchased and fabricated the panels, Harley Facades, which installed it, and architects Studio E had all said they cannot yet participate.  \u0026ldquoThese parties make no comment on the detailed criticism of their work, nor do they even comment on drawings that they themselves drafted, she told the hearing.  \u0026ldquoSignificantly, they do not indicate how they proposed to achieve compliance (to building regulations), assuming, that is, that they ever applied their minds to that question.  Expert reports released on Monday identified the cladding system installed on the building as the main reason the flames shot up the side of the tower block with such speed.  Ms Barwise hit out at the corporate bodies over their alleged behaviour.  She said: \u0026ldquoThese contractors should not be allowed, by their deliberate refusal to participate, to derail determination of the compliance issue even though we are concerned with blatant non-compliance.  \u0026ldquoDespite their words of condolence to the victims, these corporates have no desire to assist this inquiry, even though their participation could save lives in the immediate future.  \u0026ldquoThe corporate silence deprives the families of the degree of resolution and understanding to which they are entitled and has only served to increase their pain and uncertainty.  \u0026ldquoIt is inhumane to remain silent when so many seek understanding and answers \u0026ndash answers which are within the corporates\u0026rsquo gift.  Mr Weatherby later agreed: \u0026ldquoThis is a public search for the truth. It is not a game of cat-and-mouse, nor is it a matter of smoke and mirrors.  A statement provided by the Tenant Management Organisation (TMO) was also scrutinised during Tuesday\u0026rsquos hearing.  The TMO ran the building and oversaw the doomed refurbishment that finished a year before the fire.  Sam Stein QC, representing several bereaved and survivors, said: \u0026ldquoThe TMO say this: \u0026lsquoWhy combustible cladding was used on Grenfell Tower is something this inquiry will have to consider.\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoAs the commercial client, it is, we suggest, extraordinary that their opening statement suggests that the TMO is waiting for the inquiry to tell it why it wrapped Grenfell Tower in combustible material.  \u0026ldquoThe TMO was not a small management organisation \u0026ndash they managed 10,000 homes.

Many shoppers have previously complained that H\u0026ampM sizes are too small.  In March, shopper Rebecca Parker wrote an open letter after she struggled to fit into a size 14 at H\u0026ampM despite being a 12 to 14.  She wrote: \u0026ldquoThe more I thought about it, and those jeans, I realised it wasn\u0026rsquot my failure that prevented me from pulling on a pair of trousers, but yours.  \u0026ldquoI am very proud of my body. It has taken a long time but I am thoroughly content with my large hips, squishy thighs and little tum, thank you very much.  \u0026ldquoWhen I tried on your jeans I was annoyed, hot and frustrated.

The competition began nearly 100 years ago in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as a bathing beauty contest designed to keep tourists coming to the seaside resort in the weekend after Labour Day.  But it has run into resistance to the swimsuit, and to a lesser extent, evening gown competitions that had come to be seen by some as outdated.  An email scandal last December in which former Miss America officials denigrated the intelligence, appearance and sex lives of former title winners led to a shake-up at the top, and the group\u0026rsquos top three leadership positions are now held by women.  Gretchen Carlson, a former Miss America who is head of the organisation\u0026rsquos board of trustees, made the announcement on Good Morning America.

Ms Carlson, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes led to his departure, said the board has heard from potential contestants saying: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot want to be out there in high heels and swimsuits.  \u0026ldquoGuess what? she said. \u0026ldquoYou don\u0026rsquot have to anymore.  Asked if she is worried the show\u0026rsquos television ratings might suffer because of the elimination of swimsuits, Ms Carlson said she is not, adding that the swimsuit portion is not the highest rated section of the broadcast.  Viewers seem to be more interested in the talent competition, she said.  She also said the group will make changes to the evening wear portion of the competition, adding it will not judge women on their chosen attire.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos what comes out of their mouths that we care about, she said.  The changes will start with this year\u0026rsquos broadcast on September 9.  Ms Carlson said the Miss America Organisation will emphasise its role as a scholarship provider."},{"url":null,"title":"Labour too divided to back proposals for Norway-style Brexit deal     Starmer","story":"              Labour has\u0026nbsprejected proposals for a Norway-style relationship with the European Union because the party is too divided on the issue, the shadow Brexit secretary has said.

He told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme: \u0026ldquoThe difficulty with that, and I think everybody recognises this, is that there are very strong and very different views across the PLP on that particular amendment.  \u0026ldquoSo, whilst there\u0026rsquos unity on all the others and we will all be voting together, on that amendment there are very divided views.

The harbour seal pup, which is less than two weeks old,\u0026nbspwas rescued on Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides by local vet David Buckland after occupants of a house overlooking Prince\u0026rsquos Beach discovered her on June 1.  Mr Buckland provided her with plenty of fluids as she was extremely malnourished.  It is not known what happened to her mother.  Once she was fit to travel, the seal was flown to Glasgow by Loganair, free of charge, and then taken to the Scottish SPCA National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fischcross, Clackmannanshire, to continue her recovery.  Mr Buckland, from the Southern Isles Veterinary Practice, accompanied the pup on her journey on Monday evening.  Loganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said: \u0026ldquoIt was a pleasure to make arrangements to fly the baby seal pup to Glasgow, and make sure she was given first-class service for her first time on board an aircraft.  \u0026ldquoThe Highlands and Islands is our heartland and we\u0026rsquore always glad to help where we can.  The rescue centre is also caring for a young male pup rescued from the Isle of Eigg and both seals will be looked after together until they are ready to be released back into the wild.  Scottish SPCA centre manager Colin Seddon said: \u0026ldquoWe have received a young female harbour seal at our centre in Fishcross, who seems to be in reasonably good health.  \u0026ldquoShe was found on a beach in Eriskay and appeared to be dehydrated.  \u0026ldquoHarbour seals are very vulnerable, and we will be keeping a close eye on her while she remains in our care.  \u0026ldquoWe also received a male harbour seal of around the same age from the Isle of Eigg. He has improved overnight but will require round-the- clock care over the coming days.  \u0026ldquoHaving two pups in at the same time is great for socialisation and the pair will be reared together.  \u0026ldquoWhen they are ready to go back into the wild we will be able to release them at a suitable location on the west coast together.  Loganair has launched a competition on social media to name the pups, with the choices in line with SSPCA\u0026rsquos Disney/Pixar theme for 2018: Ariel and Eric, Nala and Simba. or Dory and Marlin from the films The Little Mermaid, The Lion King and Finding Nemo.  Loganair is no stranger to carrying unusual animals, particularly having flown\u0026nbspShetland ponies to Fair Isle in the 1970s."}]
