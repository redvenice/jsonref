That they belong.\u0027\u0027It doesn\u0027t feel good to have been working at the company that put that out there,\u0027 Terra Field, a software engineer at Netflix, wrote in a Medium post.\u0027Especially when we\u0027ve spent years building out the company\u0027s policies and benefits so that it would be a great place for trans people to work.\u0027Three employees including Field were reportedly suspended last week after crashing a virtual meeting for executives on the Chappelle special, but later reinstated. Another was sacked for leaking internal data about the cost of the program.The walkout and rally have drawn support from film and television celebrities such as Jameela Jamil (The Good Place) and Jonathan Van Ness (Queer Eye), who have recorded a video message expressing \u0027love and support\u0027 for the movement.\u0027This has been such a challenging time I\u0027m sure for all of you,\u0027 Van Ness said in a video released Wednesday by the activist group Team Trans. \u0027It really is so often the trans, non-binary and intersex folks who actually advance theses conversations so often at risk to themselves and to their careers.\u0027Van Ness identifies as nonbinary.\u0027I know it\u0027s not easy. I know it\u0027s scary. I have so much respect for you and so much love and gratitude for you for sticking up for the LGBT+ community\u0027s right to dignity and safety and respect,\u0027 said Jamil. Acclaimed comedian Hannah Gadbsy - who has her own popular Netflix specials - last week called the streaming giant an \u0027amoral algorithm cult.\u0027Chappelle has been accused of mocking transgender people in the past, but remains hugely popular.In The Closer, he describes a US rapper who \u0027punched the LGBTQ community right in the AIDS,\u0027 compares trans women to the use of Blackface, and jokes about threatening to kill a woman and stash her body in his car.Chappelle - who is black - also argues that white gay people \u0027are minorities until they need to be white again,\u0027 and that LGBTQ communities have made progress in a few years that black people have not enjoyed in decades.Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout - The VergeNetflix Employees Stage Walkout to Protest Dave Chappelle Special - Variety"},{"url":null,"title":"Government paper says ramping price high carbon foods help people eat sustainably","story":"Share this articleWhitehall considers meat tax to slash carbon emissions"},{"url":null,"title":"British Gas gets rapped advertising watchdog rules energy giant misled customers","story":"Share this article The regulator said: ‘The ads implied that all British Gas HomeCare customers would be able to call out engineers to attend urgent issues at short notice.’Around 3.4million HomeCare customers pay the energy giant hundreds of pounds a year to insure and service their boilers.But lockdown restrictions and an engineer strike resulted in a major backlog earlier this year."},{"url":null,"title":"Saudi Arabia Japan Australia lobbied scientists water report climate change","story":"Share this article If China does not commit to new action, the prospect of keeping global warming to 1.5C could well be scuppered.

She said it would lead them having to compete with New Zealand farmers not bound by the same standards, which she said was “extremely unfair”. She told the programme: Batters also saids the same problem applied to the outline free trade agreement already agreed with Australia. She said: There is more about the NFU’s objections to the New Zealand deal on its website here. The Conservative party used to be seen solidly pro-farming. But these comments, following Boris Johnson effectively joking about the plight of pig farmers at the Tory conference, shows that assumption no longer applies. The government’s own plan B involves three definite measures (telling the public to behave more cautiously, mandating vaccine passports for some settings, and mandating face coverings for some settings) and one potential measure (telling people to work from home for a limited measure). In a paper published today (pdf), the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change backs making face coverings mandatory in crowded public spaces now, and says mandatory Covid passes should also be considered.  But mostly the report advises measures that would improve vaccine coverage. Blair said: The report makes 12 proposals. Here they are: In an interview this morning Edward Argar, the health minister, said the story was “without foundation”. Asked about the report, he told Sky News: Of course, whether or not a policy is being considered by government is often better seen as a spectrum assessment than a straightforward yesno officials often consider worst-case contingency options that never end up as proposals for ministers.But are the government’s main scientific advisers also in favour of a move to plan B now? They, of course, must speak for themselves, but it is not hard to guess where their instincts lie. In July, when the government announced the full opening up in England, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said opening up should proceed more slowly. In September, when the government published its plan for winter (including a minimalist plan B, which is similar to plan A in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), Sage called for plan B-style measures to be implemented immediately. And at that point Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, stressed that it was always important to “go early” when introducing measures to control rising cases. On the Today programme this morning Edward Argar, a health minister, was asked if the government was now ignoring advice from Vallance and others. Argar at first denied that, arguing that the government listened to a range of advice, Argar said. But when asked directly by Nick Robinson if Vallance was telling ministers it was right not to implement plan B now, Argar would not say that. He went on: In an earlier interview, on Sky News, Argar was also asked if the government was following Vallance’s advice to “go early”. Argar replied: But actually that isn’t really what Vallance has been saying at all Vallance’s argument is that the right moment to act is normally before it is considered necessary. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Department for Education publishes school absence figures for England for autumn 2020 and spring 2021. 10am: Prof Sir Ian Diamdon, head of the Office for National Statistics, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. 11am: The Department of Health and Social Care publishes its weekly test and trace figures. 11am: Boris Johnson attends a service at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh to commemorate the centenary of Northern Ireland. 12.45pm: Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech on how pensions can contribute to net zero.

Photograph: Alan BetsonPharmacists should be involved in the rollout of the booster vaccine campaign, the general-secretary of the Irish Pharmacy Union has said.Darragh O’Loughlin said pharmacists had been included in the original plans as vaccinators but were not included until the summer.“When we did start vaccinating we saw tremendous demand from people to get their vaccine in a local pharmacy - pharmacies were inundated with people looking to get vaccinated,” he told Newstalk’s Breakfast Briefing. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) this week approved the extension of Covid-19 booster shots to people over the age of 60.A number of prominent GPs have criticised the HSE’s plan to rely on family doctors for administering boosters to older patients.However, plans announced on Wednesday did not contain any reference to pharmacies, Mr O’Loughlin said. A number of prominent GPs have criticised the HSE’s plan to rely on family doctors for administering boosters to older patients.Navan GP Ruairí Hanley said the system “cannot cope” with providing boosters to everyone aged over 60 in the coming months.“That will simply prove impossible in the context of flu season and the existing pressures on the system,” he told The  on Wednesday.Meanwhile Mr O’Loughlin said it would make perfect sense for pharmacies to be involved in the booster programme as there are 1,000 pharmacies in the country delivering the vaccine every week with people still coming forward every day to get vaccinated,.“It makes no sense that as we move into the booster phase of the programme we wouldn’t be involved in delivering those boosters”.“It looks like GPs are going to be expected to pick up the bulk of the work - despite the fact that the GP system is already under such pressure - and vaccination centres will be used as well.“We obviously aren’t saying vaccination centres shouldn’t be used, and we aren’t saying GPs shouldn’t be involved. We’re just saying that in a programme of this size and a campaign of this size, where we will want 800,000 people between the ages of 60 upwards to get vaccinated with a booster dose, it makes no sense to exclude 1,000 vaccination locations around the country”.Meanwhile, oncologist Prof Seamus O’Reilly, speaking on Morning Ireland, called for a targeted social media campaign to encourage the unvaccinated.Such a campaign had been undertaken by CervicalCheck and he felt it would help to address the concerns of the unvaccinated rather than berate them.The virus was going to be an issue for years to come as new variants emerged worldwide.This means vaccination programmes have to be accelerated, he said, otherwise waiting lists were going to grow as care was erted to Covid cases.

It is going ahead without the heads of state of either the Republic of Ireland or the United Kingdom, who the organisers had hoped would attend the service.Queen Elizabeth was due to be present but cancelled her visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday on medical advice. Last month, there was controversy over the decision by President Michael D Higgins to decline an invitation to the event. President Higgins said the title of the event was politicised and it would not be appropriate for him to attend. The Service of Reflection and Hope is taking place in St Patrick’s Church of Ireland cathedral. It is organised by the leaders of the five main Christian churches in Ireland – the Catholic and Church of Ireland Primates of All Ireland Eamon Martin and John McDowell, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church Dr David Bruce, the President of the Methodist Church Dr Thomas Patterson and the President of the Irish Council of Churches Dr Ivan Patterson. About 130 people are expected to attend, including the UK prime minister Boris Johnson Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the chief whip, Jack Chambers Northern Ireland’s First Minister Paul Givan the leaders of the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance parties and the Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis. Also present is the North’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride. Other invited guests include iniduals prominent in peacebuilding and in the medical world, as well as people from different ethnic backgrounds to represent the ersity of the Ireland that has developed since 1921.In a message released on St Patrick’s Day this year, the church leaders outlined the motivation behind the service and expressed their hope that their “shared reflection on our past will support and strengthen” engagement and inspire “us to renew our commitment to the work of building peace in the future.”There was an “opportunity”, they said, “in marking these events from our past, to be intentional in creating the spaces for encounter with those who are different from us, and those who may feel marginalised in the narratives that have shaped our community identity.“This will require us to face difficult truths about failings in our own leadership in the world of peace and reconciliation.“As Christian churches we acknowledge and lament the times that we failed to bring to a tearful and ided society that message of the deeper connection that binds us, despite our different identities, as children of God made in His image and likeness.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"consultant claimed mcd associate maligned industry figures","story":"Concert promoter MCD runs the Electric Picnic festival. Photograph: Dave Meehan Concert promoter MCD Productions, which runs the Electric Picnic festival, is investigating claims that a person linked to the business “maligned” some music industry figures on social media.The claims about some people being “vilified” on sites such as Twitter and Facebook came to light during the summer in a consultant’s review of the culture in MCD, which is controlled by US events giant Live Nation Entertainment of Beverly Hills, California. The consultant subsequently contacted people outside MCD and asked to speak to them in connection with the claims.MCD is the biggest promoter in the State and Live Nation is one of the most powerful organisations in the global music business, with 500 million annual ticket sales before the pandemic. Co-founder of MCD Denis Desmond said this week that the company was facing complaints of “abrasive management behaviour” in the business but he did not elaborate.Now correspondence has emerged in which a human resources consultant – Peter Ryan of Dublin firm RA Consulting – told people in the music industry of concerns within the company about some posts on social media.“By way of introduction, I am retained by MCD Productions to provide HR and related consultancy services to the company,” Mr Ryan said in email seen by The .“In undertaking a review of the organisational culture, a number of personnel advised that you had been maligned by an MCD associate on social media (Twitter andor Facebook),” he said.“You will appreciate that the company was most concerned to learn of this and is committed to ensuring that nobody is vilified by staff or associates.”Declined to commentContacted on Wednesday on the mobile phone number he gave on the email, Mr Ryan declined to comment on any aspect of his work for MCD.He told recipients that he would welcome an opportunity to discuss the claims by phone, Zoom or in person “and will be pleased to work around your availability”.The correspondence went out in August, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the email.

Taoiseach says STFU in the Dáil while enduring GBH of the ear hole from DHR. Surely it can’t be true. This coarsening of debate in national politics has to stop. So do you have anything to say about this, Micheál?“Ah shut the fuh. . .” Sorry, could you repeat that? Only we couldn’t quite hear you above the tortured howls of Danny Healy-Rae. Say it again. Please. But this time, finish the sentence properly. Go ahead, Taoiseach, make our day. . .Blink and you would have missed it. But yesterday Micheál Martin almost did what most politicians merely dream of doing at some point in their working lives. Being shouted at on a regular basis – whether by a political opponent or an irate member of the public – is increasingly part of the job for people who choose a career in representative politics. But even when patience is clearly wearing thin, TDs tend to bite their lip for the sake of decorum and tough it out. Whereas in reality what they really want to do is tell their tormentor to put a sock in it and stick their half-baked opinions where the sun don’t shine. But they rarely do. And certainly not in the rarified confines of the Dáil chamber. Shut the hell upYou don’t need to be in politics to know the misery of someone yabbering on at you for the umpteenth time as you silently scream at them to shut the hell up. The Taoiseach was on the verge of snapping during questions on promised legislation. He’s been a bit down in the dumps since his Government’s big plan to deliver a lifeline to lovelorn and lustful clubbers shrivelled in the cold shower of Covid. The reopening of nightclubs and return of full capacity gigs should have been the centrepiece of a set-piece announcement on Monday clearing the way for a wholesale lifting of restrictions tomorrow. But an alarming rise in Covid cases filling up an alarming lack of hospital beds put paid to that. Micheál and his downcast Coalition partners had no choice but to keep some restrictions in place. To assuage the owners of badly weakened businesses in the night-time economy, it was decided to stick with letting them start up again after almost two years in the dark, but with a hastily drawn up, confusing and unworkable list of provisos. How galling it must be for the Taoiseach – who is back and forth to Europe on important national business and who leads a country with a seat on the UN security council – to see his hard work and high office reduced to probing questions about whether the shift in Coppers is outlawed and if the mandatory wearing of masks late at night in darkened drinking dens points to a disturbing lowering of morals in Cabinet. Nightclub ownersIn the Dáil, Alan Kelly wondered why Monday’s press conference went ahead after circumstances had so obviously changed. He had “put the cart before the horse” by announcing “incomprehensible” restrictions without consulting the nightclub owners preparing to reopen in a matter of days.“When was the last time YOU were in a nightclub?” asked the Labour leader, whose primal display of pole-dancing to the top of his supporters’ shoulders is immortalised in a photograph from the 2016 election count. He said the restrictions as they stand (or sit, depending on the venue and class of entertainment) “will simply not work. It’s not natural”. “We thought two weeks ago that we would be opening without restrictions” Micheál wanly replied, heavy disappointment in his voice. Everything was flying until last Wednesday when the medical experts started ringing the alarm bells and pointing to a deterioration in the situation. Yes, the nightclub operators got short notice of the change in reopening requirements but that was down to the sudden setback in the numbers. “And you used a good phrase there: “It’s not natural. Covid is not natural” stressed the Taoiseach. “That’s the problem. There are many twists and turns with it and it can upset the best laid plans.” Special “guidance” will be issued to venue operators and music promoters, but their activities must be “ring-fenced for live entertainment”, he said. But everywhere else when a pint is pulled or a lemonade poured, people will have to keep their hands to themselves and remain in their seats with their legs under control. (Sanitiser will be available in the clubs. Ice and lemon optional.)Yesterday afternoon at an event outside the Dáil, Minister for Arts and Culture Catherine Martin promised that the anomalies and contradictions in the plan to reintroduce nightlife will be ironed out the day before the scheduled reopening. The Taoiseach is also confident the situation will be resolved as best as possible. Blackthorn sticksThere were unconfirmed reports that masks and restrictions on movement is to be abandoned in favour of a new task force led by Dr Tony Holohan which will patrol nightspots around the country with the express intention of walloping people who are too close together with stout blackthorn sticks. Martin hadn’t been expecting to deal with murder on the Dáil dance floor when his week began. “My central object and that of my Government is to protect lives and protect people’s health . . . that’s not giving out to criticising or blaming anybody, but that has to be central” he stressed wearily. Leaders’ Questions gave way to questions on promised legislation. Matters proceeded uneventfully until Danny Healy-Rae ambled through a gap in the hedge with a query about the culling of cattle to combat climate change. He said the Taoiseach had been quoted as saying he is in favour of reducing the size of the national herd. “Where did I say that?” asked Micheál. Sure he wouldn’t mention it if it wasn’t out there. Go check the quote for yourself, said DHR. “It’s out there,” insisted Danny. Produce it so, repeated the Taoiseach, rapidly reaching the conclusion that in this farming-related query, Healy-Rae should be seen but not herd. “I didn’t make it up” harrumphed the Independent TD for Kerry, getting thick now. “I can’t believe the disinformation” protested the Taoiseach, affronted Cork accent to the fore.“It’s in the papers” shouted Danny.“It’s in the papers, man” repeated Micheál sarcastically. Where so? Where?“The farming papers . . .” blustered his accuser. “I didn’t make it up, man. It’s out there.”The Taoiseach appealed to the leas Cheann Comhairle. DHR should not get away with saying something which is untrue. He should withdraw it. “Well, you disprove me so, if it twas wrong,” bellowed Danny. Micheál shook his head and laughed. He was about to say something back, but what was the point? He gave up, throwing both hands up to the continuing din.“Aah shut the fu . . .”And his voice trailed off. He very nearly said it, but, to the unspeakable disappointment of listening reporters, he stopped himself in the nick of time.But we knew how he felt.

Two Eastern European cruise liners have also been brought to the Clyde as makeshift dormitories.It has prompted anger from the Government in Westminster, which believes Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u0027s First Minister, and Glasgow’s SNP-run council have risked the showpiece event turning into a national embarrassment.“It will be chaos if this continues,” said one senior UK government source.When Claire Perry, the former energy minister and then president of Cop26, announced two years ago that Glasgow would host the summit, she said it was the ideal venue because it is “one of the UK’s most sustainable cities with a great track record for hosting high-profile international events”.That reputation is now in shreds thanks to the nationalists running Holyrood and the city council.Earlier this year, the council ditched fortnightly bin collections in favour of one collection every three weeks - causing bins to overflow. At the same time, it introduced a £35 charge for disposing of large items, leading to an inevitable increase in fly-tipping. Thomas Kerr, the leader of the Conservative group on Glasgow council, said the city had become “the fly-tipping capital of Britain”.Critics were enraged when the council leader, the SNP’s Susan Aitken, brushed off the crisis by claiming the city merely needed a “spruce up”.Glasgow’s rat population has thrived on the uncollected food waste to become the fourth-biggest in the country. Three refuse collectors have even been injured by the rodents.Last week, refuse workers voted to go on strike during the conference, from Monday, November 1 to Monday, November 8, unless they are paid more money. The irony of a summit to clean up the planet being held in a city that cannot clean up its own streets will not be lost on those attending.Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said the SNP had ensured that “Scotland is set to be humiliated on the world stage”, while Paul Sweeney, the Labour MSP for Glasgow, said: “It\u0027s going to be an absolute embarrassment when we will shortly have world leaders stepping over bin bags and rats bigger than cats.”A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said of the planned strike by refuse workers: Cop26 will undoubtedly be a busy and difficult time for the city and its residents. Holding this action only in Glasgow at this time will have disproportionate and unfair local impact in pursuit of a national campaign. We urge them to think again about the timing of this.The spokesman said fly-tipped waste was being removed within two days of being reported, and that Glasgow\u0027s rat population was entirely in keeping with the size of the city.Hours after the GMB announced strike action by refuse workers, the RMT union announced a strike by ScotRail staff from November 1 to November 12 - the entire duration of the conference.Graham Simpson MSP, Scotland’s Conservative shadow transport minister, said the strike action was “a major embarrassment for the SNP” and would mean world leaders and delegates arriving in a city where rail services will have “ground to a halt”.The likes of Joe Biden, of course, are unlikely to hop on the train to get to Cop26, but many of the 25,000 delegates would have done. Now they will be forced onto the roads to get from their hotels to the Scottish Event Campus (SEC), where the conference is being held. Even before the rail strikes were announced, Glasgow City Council helpfully published a map of where to expect road congestion during the summit, which showed the entire city centre coloured in red.A gridlocked motorway and road network will be like nectar to members of Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and other climate change protesters.They will relish the chance to bring VIP traffic to a complete standstill by glueing themselves to roads, especially after Assistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins, Police Scotland’s gold commander for the event, said officers on the ground “will facilitate unlawful protest, to a point” and would be “fair, friendly and accommodating”.His comments have caused such alarm that Police Scotland was forced to call a press briefing on Thursday at which they insisted protesters will not be allowed to disrupt the conference and that “protest removal teams” stand ready to remove anyone who blocks roads.If extremists needed any further encouragement, ministers in the Scottish Government have also issued an open invitation to them to disrupt the conference.Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens and an environment minister in Holyrood’s coalition government, has said he supports the use of direct action by climate change protesters and urged them to find “creative” ways to protest.For the lucky few, conference events will be a short walk away from their hotels in the city. However for others, a shortage of accommodation has forced them to book rooms up to 130 miles away.One Whitehall source said: “Embassies and businesses have been getting in touch with the Government because they are unable to get hotel rooms. It’s a massive problem.“Some of them have resorted to staying in England and commuting to Glasgow because there’s just nowhere to stay in Glasgow. We have heard of people deciding to stay as far away as Newcastle.”There are still rooms available through Airbnb, but the so-called “Glasgow gold rush” has seen property owners asking mind-boggling sums. One apartment in the upmarket Kelvingrove area of the city has been advertised at £103,000 for 12 nights, while dozens of others are asking more than £20,000 for the duration of the conference.A few hotel rooms remain available, but only to those prepared to pay 30 times the normal going rate. One room which normally costs £42 was being advertised for £1,400 per night during the summit, while other budget hotels are charging more than £1,000 per night.The lack of beds has become so dire that two cruise ships are being berthed on the Clyde for people working at Cop26. The Latvian-flagged Romantika has already arrived in Renfrew. It will soon be followed by the Silja Europa, from Estonia, in what the vessels’ owner, Tallink, described as a last-minute agreement.In an act of desperation, the Scottish Government has now appealed to residents to open up their homes and allow conference-goers to sleep in their spare rooms. They have suggested that the Cop26 Homestay scheme will enable delegates from poorer countries to “attend the summit and make their voices heard”. However, local health chiefs are concerned it will simply turn Cop26 into a petri dish for Covid.Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said: People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that.Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk\u0027s homes, and that increases the risk even more.Downing Street fears that the multiple failings will not be enough to dampen Nicola Sturgeon’s desire to hijack the event for her own means. Leaked notes and WhatsApp messages have shown that Number 10 and the Cabinet Office are concerned she will use the event as a “soapbox for her independence obsession”. They want to make sure she does not share a platform with Boris Johnson at any point.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We have been working very closely with the UK Government and partners, including Glasgow City Council and Police Scotland, to deliver a safe, secure and successful Cop26 in November. More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS pressure is \u0026#39sustainable\u0026#39, minister insists - but doctors say otherwiseOrionid Meteor shower 2021: when to see it peak, and other dates to watch out for in the UKHow do you solve a problem like GP appointments?France prepared to block UK membership of EU research programme over Brexit fishing rowBoy, 14, charged with murder of five-year-old Logan MwangiRobot artist freed from Egyptian custody after espionage fearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 government wont hesitate lock country","story":"Don’t plan any social gatherings after November  12 – that’s my advice. That is the day that the great and good of the climate lobby fly off back home, many in their private jets, and consequently the day the Government will feel free once again to plunge Britain back into some kind of lockdown. The vultures are already circling. You know something is up when Professor Neil Ferguson starts reappearing on the airwaves. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, has demanded that ministers at once implement a winter plan B, which he said consisted of enforcing mask-wearing, ordering people to work from home and introducing vaccination passports – although Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, yesterday told the Commons health committee that the Government will still be working out details over the next couple of weeks. If you didn’t notice, Parliament has quietly extended the Government’s emergency Covid powers for another six months.   We know where this will lead. The Prime Minister will fend off the Fergusons for a while – all the more so this time around because he won’t want to spoil his big party in Glasgow (although what is allowed to happen there will depend on Nicola Sturgeon). But eventually he will capitulate, and will appear in his Downing Street briefing room telling us that there is no option other than to send us all back to our hidey holes and await the all-clear, quite possibly some time next spring.There is no visible strategy behind any of this. We have become prisoners of the daily Covid numbers. When they rise, ministers start panicking. When they rise fast enough to present as a straight upwards line on one of Chris Whitty’s graphs, they panic a little more. When Ferguson or one of Sage’s modelling teams present a graph projecting that deaths have a theoretical chance of exceeding some previous peak, the game is up – we’re in lockdown.   Meanwhile, the Government has started to drift on its one genuine achievement: the vaccination programme. Having once led the world, we have stalled with 66.5 per cent of the population fully-vaccinated – well behind former laggards like Italy (70.2 per cent) and Spain (79.3 per cent). Ministers prevaricated over whether or not booster shots would be needed, with the result they started late. Only 27.8 per cent of care home residents and 14.1 per cent of staff have received a third booster jab. The Government, too, last month cancelled an order for 100 million doses of the French-developed Valneva vaccine, which, according to trial results published this week, seems to be more effective than the AstraZeneca jab. Before we start to disappear down the rabbit hole once more, one small reform I would like is this: for the Government to stop simply publishing raw figures of new Covid infections, hospitalisations with Covid and deaths. Instead it should publish statistics on mortality from all causes, broken down by age – so we can see Covid cases in their proper context. If the Government published similar figures for pneumonia and influenza and we started agonising over them, we would never fully open society, certainly not in winter. Secondly, wouldn’t it be helpful if the Government broke down its Covid figures to show how many of those deaths and hospitalisations were among vaccinated people and how many among unvaccinated people?  Publishing such figures might even be just the incentive the Government needs to persuade the rest of the population to be vaccinated. Never mind vaccination passports, just give us the facts – how many of the seriously-ill are vaccinated and how many are not – and leave us to make up our own minds. It might well turn out to be the difference between freedom and lockdown. More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS pressure is \u0026#39sustainable\u0026#39, minister insists - but doctors say otherwiseOrionid Meteor shower 2021: when to see it peak, and other dates to watch out for in the UKHow do you solve a problem like GP appointments?France prepared to block UK membership of EU research programme over Brexit fishing rowBoy, 14, charged with murder of five-year-old Logan MwangiRobot artist freed from Egyptian custody after espionage fearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deal new zealand win win countries","story":"This week is proving to be the biggest yet in realising our vision for Global Britain. On Tuesday, we hosted the Global Investment Summit, which saw the world’s leading investors commit nearly £10 billion to the industries of the future across the UK. Today, we are proud to announce we have secured a free trade agreement in principle with one of our oldest and closest allies: New Zealand.Our like-minded democracies could not be closer through our shared history and values. We are united in our fundamental belief that the best way to boost jobs and growth lies firmly in free trade, underpinned by high standards and the rule of law. This agreement shows what Britain can achieve through an independent trade policy, by slashing red tape for small businesses, securing zero-tariff access to New Zealand for all British goods and opening up their market to our world-class tech and services companies.This deal gives British businesses the competitive edge in New Zealand’s fast-growing market. It cuts tariffs on our goods exports such as ships, buses and bulldozers, which means firms can do business at lower cost in an import market which is set to grow by 30 per cent over this decade. In turn, we are making it easier for British consumers to enjoy more of the best New Zealand has to offer, from Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to Manuka honey and kiwi fruit.This agreement is a win-win, and it plays to our strengths as the second-largest services exporter in the world. It will be easier for UK lawyers, architects and other professionals to work in New Zealand, allowing UK companies to set up there and take British talent with them.As we look forward to hosting New Zealand alongside other partners for the COP26 climate change summit, it is fitting that our new trade deal is one of our greenest ever. A far-reaching environment chapter will encourage trade and investment in low carbon goods, services and technology, with the most comprehensive list of environmental goods with liberalised tariffs in any trade deal.The agreement shows the UK’s readiness to lead the charge globally on clean innovation and sustainable growth and We already leading by example, with tariffs cut on over a hundred green goods from around the world as part of our Global Tariff regime. Investors can see we are a global hub for green trade, with EY estimating that London is the top city in Europe for investment-backed “cleantech” projects.it caps a fantastic week of good green news. Besides the success of Tuesday’s Global Investment Summit, £5.8 billion of foreign investment in green projects has been secured since the launch of the PM’s Ten Point Plan, along with at least 56,000 jobs in the UK’s clean industries.Digital trade is becoming ever more important, which is why we have agreed world-leading provisions that will cut red tape for our advanced tech and services companies and make it easier for smaller businesses to break into the New Zealand market.This deal also marks a major step in our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This high-standards pact includes eleven dynamic economies, worth more than £8 trillion in global GDP as of last year.Joining CPTPP will mean we can export more than ever to a collective marketplace of over half a billion people who crave high-quality goods and services. That will drive forward an exports-led recovery across every region and nation of the UK, levelling up our country with high-quality jobs.Our deal with New Zealand will help us seize new opportunities abroad while boosting jobs, enterprise and prosperity at home. Together, we will come out of the pandemic stronger as we build back better and greener through trade.Anne-Marie Trevelyan is Secretary of State for International TradeMore from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS pressure is \u0026#39sustainable\u0026#39, minister insists - but doctors say otherwiseOrionid Meteor shower 2021: when to see it peak, and other dates to watch out for in the UKHow do you solve a problem like GP appointments?France prepared to block UK membership of EU research programme over Brexit fishing rowBoy, 14, charged with murder of five-year-old Logan MwangiRobot artist freed from Egyptian custody after espionage fearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"need referendum net zero save britain green blob","story":"Does the blob never learn? Voters don’t like being treated like naughty children, let alone apathetic imbeciles, by technocrats convinced that they know best. Much of the electorate is now in a permanently defiant, irritable mood. It has grown allergic to stitch-ups by the ruling class across Westminster, the City, the arts and academia, and is repelled by attempts to impose a single political vision as a fait accompli, with no debate and no consultation. This applies as much to radical environmentalism and net zero, the groupthink du jour, as it does to Brexit, the NHS, overseas wars, crime or immigration.The universal franchise was hard-won. The electorate is deeply attached to its democratic rights, not just when it comes to form – elections being held, and results respected – but also in terms of ethos. It expects the great questions of the day to be carefully discussed, and for voters to have the ultimate choice between meaningfully different options. Decisions cannot be delegated to a self-anointed, conformist oligarchy.Voters hate it when, as with the EU, they were told by Labour, Tories and Lib Dems alike that ever-closer union was the best of all possible worlds, that the only acceptable debate was about the speed of integration, and that only a racist would disagree. Ordinary folks’ revenge, when it came, was devastating.It beggars belief, therefore, that a government of Brexiteers, in power only because they led a populist rebellion against another cross-party consensus, have forgotten this crucial lesson when it comes to net zero, and are seeking to enshrine a revolution without consulting the public. Yes, the vast majority, at least in wealthy nations, wants to improve the environment, reduce pollution, bolster bioersity, treat animals better and prevent man-made catastrophes.But that is where the near-universal consensus ends: the details of how to proceed are explosively contentious, and require democratic assent to be legitimate. The parallel with Brexit is clear: the fact that voters all agreed that another European war must be avoided didn’t mean they all wanted to fuse their countries into a superstate.The Government has learnt the wrong lessons from Covid – in a genuine health or military emergency, the electorate temporarily gives its support to any government it believes is doing its best. Even in such cases, a minority will favour alternative solutions, such as a Swedish approach.Decarbonisation is entirely different to the pandemic, whether or not you judge that we face a climate emergency. The public won’t automatically rally around whatever the government proposes. Many, perhaps most, will hate much of it. Net zero involves long-term, hugely significant measures that could drastically modify lifestyles and give the state immense, permanent powers to socially engineer as it sees fit.Do you agree that all new petrol and diesel cars should be banned in just nine years’ time? Or that gas boilers should be replaced, at great cost, with heat pumps, a technology that doesn’t quite work yet? Are you willing to eat less meat and pay higher taxes? Do you disagree entirely, or accept some of these ideas but not others? Or would you prefer to take it more slowly given China’s reluctance to act?The shocking reality is that how you answer is irrelevant. The public isn’t being given a choice. The fact of, and speed, scale and method of decarbonisation have been decided: Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all agree on all the essentials. It doesn’t matter who wins the next election: a new orthodoxy rules supreme. There is no functioning democracy, no mechanism by which outcomes might change. This is a disgrace and extremely dangerous.One doesn’t have to disagree with everything the Government is planning to be concerned. I really like electric cars, though I can’t see how banning combustion engines so quickly in the absence of better, long-range batteries can work. Why not let capitalism continue to organically shift consumers over? It is great that Boris rejects the hair-shirt, neo-communist approach to greening Britain, and that he backs nuclear and hydrogen. But do I really trust a government that has waged war on the car, invented so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods and campaigned against Heathrow expansion not to revert to banning everything vaguely carbon-positive if it falls behind on its targets?Why is its nudge unit advocating a tax on meat and producers and retailers of “high-carbon” food? The inflammatory document, disowned by the Government but commissioned by the Department for Business, demonises business travel and seeks to reduce international tourism and restrict airport expansion – goodbye, capitalist freedom. Can the Government guarantee that it would never impose extreme restrictions, rationing on homes and business or even mini eco-lockdowns? Or use a punitive form of road pricing to drastically reduce mobility (as opposed to ensuring motorists pay appropriately for road usage)? Will the courts start striking down high-carbon housebuilding or farming?Net zero isn’t a technical issue: it is an inherently political question, one of the greatest choices we have ever been asked to make. In the sickening absence of disagreement between the parties, a massive, uncontrollable backlash is guaranteed, at least when the bills start to drop. The only question is who the new green-sceptic Nigel Farage will be, and the next Boris figure? What will Vote Leave II look like?Johnson should preempt this war, which could destroy the Tories, and call a referendum on net zero today. His obligation, in doing so, would be to explain in exhaustive, costed detail how he proposes to achieve the changes he so fervently believes in. The No side would present its case, holding Johnson to account, proposing alternatives, with the public taken through the pros and cons and trade-offs. The results should be legally binding, with MPs compelled to implement the verdict, and the question tightly defined. The Government will have its work cut out: the Swiss have just rejected plans to slash their own emissions and to slap higher taxes on fossil fuels.The green challenge is too important, its implications too dramatic, to be left to an establishment that has embraced net zero as if it were a new religion. The public must have the final say, and the only way this will happen is through another referendum.More from NewsPolitics latest news: NHS pressure is \u0026#39sustainable\u0026#39, minister insists - but doctors say otherwiseOrionid Meteor shower 2021: when to see it peak, and other dates to watch out for in the UKHow do you solve a problem like GP appointments?France prepared to block UK membership of EU research programme over Brexit fishing rowBoy, 14, charged with murder of five-year-old Logan MwangiRobot artist freed from Egyptian custody after espionage fearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils told wear face masks school local health official bring","story":"Thousands of schoolchildren and students will be forced to wear masks again after an alarming rise in Covid cases in Suffolk.Worried education chiefs faced with a steady increase in infections and on Wednesday announced that from the end of the month, students in all 300 primary, secondary and colleges in the county must wear face coverings in communal areas outside the classroom.Students and staff will also have to cover their faces in communal areas outside the classroom and entry to schools will be restricted to essential visitors only. Even parents collecting children in the playground will have to wear a mask.The number of Covid cases among 10-14-year-olds has increased by almost 15 per cent and by 32 per cent among 15-19-year-olds in recent weeks in Suffolk.It means that so far in October schoolchildren in the county have lost 26,264 days of education after testing positive for Covid-19.These measures will be reviewed during the week commencing Nov 15.Stuart Keeble, Suffolk County Council\u0027s director of public health, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the virus is really working its way through that younger population at the moment.He said: For me now it is also about trying to keep children in school.We have had around 7,300 pupils test positive in the last 28 days. If we can keep transmission rates down, we can also keep more pupils in school as well while the vaccine is being run out for 12 to 15-year-olds.He said there is a risk if the infection starts to spread to the older population - including parents and grandparents.Mr Keeble added: We have started to see that. We have started to see an increase over the last few weeks in that parent age group of those in secondary school.He explained we are now also seeing an increase in our over-60s and this is a concern given, there are more vulnerable people in those age groups.The Government has threatened new Covid restrictions with the Health Secretary warning the public they must play their part in order to enjoy Christmas with loved ones.Sajid Javid said the Government would not implement Plan B measures such as mandatory masks, advice to work from home, and vaccine passports at this point.But ministers are coming under pressure by health officials to introduce restrictions immediately ahead of the winter and amid the rising case numbers.Health minister Edward Argar said the original plan for tackling Covid is still working.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: What Sajid (Javid, the Health Secretary) has highlighted now is that we are facing a challenging period - winter.People are indoors, infection rates are rising, and I think what he\u0027s done is levelled early with people, here is what we\u0027re seeing, but there are ways you can... the single biggest way you can impact on that and mitigate it is to have the jabs, that\u0027s the thing.Plan A in that sense, if you want to call it that, is still working. But what he highlighted is it\u0027s a race - and I\u0027ve used this phrase with you, I think, before when I\u0027ve been on your programme - it is a race between the vaccines, and getting those in people\u0027s arms, and the virus.We\u0027re still winning that race at the moment, but it\u0027s narrowing, that lead is narrowing.

However, the more that the virus is able to spread, the more chance there is of it finding a way to break through vaccine defences. Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus plan c household mixing","story":"Coronavirus Plan C with household mixing ban being discussed in GovernmentHealth Secretary Sajid Javid ruled out the implementation of Plan B restrictions despite soaring Covid cases, but officials are said to be discussing more drastic measuresRules on households mixing were first relaxed in May Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByWilliam WalkerNews ReporterLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsThe ban on households mixing could reportedly make awith Brits urged to take Covid tests before Christmas gatherings with family and friends. Cabinet Office officials are said to be discussing proposals for a clamp down on socialising, which could form part of a “Plan C”booster jabs donapost bring the virus under control by Christmas. Health Minister Edward Argar said it wasnapost being actively considered but the Government would always look at ways to prevent the virus spiralling out of control. The Government drew up a list of Plan B contingency measures as part of efforts to fight Covid this winter, which includes ato mandatory face masks, working from home and vaccine passports. But despite rising cases, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has resisted calls to implement the measures. Mr Javid told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that the Government was focusing on getting unvaccinated Brits to come forward for their jabs and rolling out booster shots.  But he warned thatpeople fail to do their bit restrictions will be more likely in the future. Officials in the Cabinet Office’s Covid taskforce are already discussing proposals which could form part of a potential “Plan C”, which would see mixing between households banned, according to the . A Whitehall source said: “The focus is very much on measures that can be taken without a major economic impact, so keeping shops, pubs and restaurants open but looking at other ways to reduce the risks.” The discussions are said to be at an aposearly stage,apos with insiders saying it formed part of contingency planning and would not be added to Plan B, or automatically introducedPlan B was enacted but didnapost work.

But the specics of that report and what was mooted in it as I understand it, as I only glanced at it Iaposm afraid on my way in this morning, about limiting household mixing, things like that ... is that it isnapost something that is being actively considered. Asked how bad the situation in the NHS would have to get before the Government moved to plan B, he said it would not be appropriate to set an arbitrary figure, X number of infections, X number of hospitalisations.  It comes after the UK recorded a seven-month high in Covid deaths on Tuesday, with fatalities up by more than % in a week. Mr Javid urged Brits to consider meeting up outdoors and also wearing masks in crowded places to prevent a further spike in cases. He said people should consider taking Covid tests before meeting up with friends and family at parties over the festive season. If they must meet indoors, he added, people should open windows in order to let in fresh air. BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the Government has taken its foot off the brake, giving the impression that the pandemic is behind us and that le has ed to normal. He said the reality of the situation is an unacceptable rate of infections, hospital admissions and deaths, which he said are unheard of in similar European nations. Dr Nagpaul added: It is wilfully negligent of the Westminster Government not to be taking any further action to reduce the spread of infection, such as mandatory mask wearing, physical distancing and ventilation requirements in high-risk settings, particularly indoor crowded spaces. These are measures that are the norm in many other nations. The ban on people from dferent households or bubbles meeting indoors was lted on May , for the first time since the New Year. At the time it was set as a maximum group of up to six people or two households - whichever was larger. The six-person limit also included babies and children, as they were not exempt. The so-called aposrule of sixapos was dropped altogether when most restrictions were canned in mid-July. The latest data on Covid case numbers reveal that on Wednesday there were a further , new cases recorded in the UK. There was also another  deaths from the disease.

The -page document had suggested “a producer-facing carbon tax” could be slapped on beef and lamb. And it proposed the government “normalise” plant-based food by offering more of it in hospital, school, prison, court, civil service and military canteens. Officials would have been encouraged to “target those learning to shop and cook for the first time, such as students.” And it could have seen a behavioural campaign to portray eating less meat as a “desirable social norm”. The document was uploaded to the government’s website yesterday as part of a Net Zero strategy and badged with the logo of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. But there was one problem - the government had already rejected the advice and it was never adopted as government policy.  The document was deleted when officials realised the blunder and the web page now says: “The information on this page has been removed because it was published in error.” A Government spokesperson said: “This was an academic research paper, not government policy. We have no plans whatsoever to dictate consumer behaviour in this way. For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans.” The document, titled Net Zero: Principles for successful behaviour change initiatives, was drawn up by the Behavioural Insights Team. Formerly the Behavioural Insights Unit, the team is now run outside government. It said plant-based foods could become “the default choice in school or government public canteens and events.” “Timely moments for diet sht will include targeting those learning to shop and cook for the first time, such as students,” it added.

For example, an unsophisticated meat tax would be highly regressive. Moreover, narratives must avoid alienation of mainstream dietary choices, or demonisation of the livestock sector, which will ultimately be the solution rather than the problem.” Boris Johnson unveiled more details of the UK’s plan to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by .

The -page blueprint lays out the Governmentaposs plans to meet legal targets to cut emissions to net zero by  in a bid to tackle dangerous climate change. Climate advisers do not think peopleaposs lives will be that dferent under the plans. Brits will still be flying, eating meat, warming their homes and going to work in the coming decades. But some big changes will be required to day-to-day le to get the UK on track to hit the targets. As the Government scrambles to prepare for COP climate summit in Glasgow, we look at how the sht to net zero will impact on your le. Homes One of the main things that will change is how we heat our homes, moving away from gas and other fossil fuels for heating and hot water, and cooking. For many people that will mean a switch from a boiler to a heat pump, installed in inidual houses and powered by electricity, working a bit like a fridge in reverse to generate heat from the outside air, or sometimes the ground. In cities, district heat networks, which pipe hot water underground to bring heat to homes from a central source, such as the energy from a waste plant, rivers, or even former mines, to heat exchangers instead of boilers in inidual homes could be the answer. And in some places, where hydrogen is being manufactured as a clean alternative to fossil fuels for industry, HGVs and other uses, it could be put through the gas pipe network to heat nearby homes with compatible new boilers. All heating technologies are more efficient at heating a home - and reducing energy demand and bills -homes are well insulated. So campaigners have called for a major energy efficiency programme to make houses much cosier than today, with double or triple glazing, draught proofing and high levels of loft and wall insulation.  Travel Transport is currently the biggest single source of emissions, so those will have to be tackled, and a key way to do that is switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. By the s, new cars will all be electric, andyou have off-street parking, you will be able to charge your car on your front drive rather than having to refuel at a petrol station. But while the range - the number of miles a car can do on a single charge - is increasing, the infrastructure to allow people to charge up on long journeys or on the street will need to improve. And itaposs not just about switching the type of vehicle you drive. Part of the picture will be cutting the number of journeys taken by car and increasing the number of people in a vehicle, as well as ensuring more walking and cycling and better provision for both. That will make towns and cities less polluted and more liveable, while people could be healthier because they are getting more exercise.  Projections by the independent advisory Climate Change Committee do not include a cut in flying, but instead a reduction in the growth in demand for flights, and the Government is pushing development of more sustainable fuels. But the Climate Assembly - a group of more than  citizens from around the country convened by Parliament to discuss how we cut our emissions to zero - did support some kind of frequent flyer levy to charge the small proportion of people who take lots of flights. The changes in working, such as more video conferencing, brought on by the pandemic, could be here to stay, cutting business travel and commuting. Diets The Climate Change Committee says we should be eating a fth less meat by . As well as cutting emissions from livestock, the move will free up land to grow energy crops or create forests that soak up excess carbon emissions and provide habitat for wildle which is also in crisis. The Government has said it will not tell people what to eat as part of its efforts to reach net zero, working with the grain of consumer choice, although it does see a slight reduction in line with current trends. The committee says its recommendations for curbing meat consumption are well within the Governmentaposs own guidelines for healthy eating.  Jobs This is another key area where things are going to change for some people, as jobs in high-carbon industries go and green jobs are created instead. This could include jobs in sectors such as manufacturing electric cars, and zero-carbon steel, boiler fitters retraining as heat pump engineers, or workers in the offshore oil and gas industry taking new jobs in the offshore wind sector. But that means there must be support, retraining and re-skilling for workers in high-carbon sectors so they are not left behind in the move to a green economy. Costs How much all of this will cost for iniduals and families is a big question, with the Treasury warning that the costs - and the benefits - will not fall equally among households, and policies will be needed to reduce the costs and spread the burden fairly. Some new technologies are signicantly more expensive, such as heat pumps, prompting the Government to bring in grants to reduce the costs, but the hope is prices will fall as markets scale up.

Government analysis though has suggested it might not have a massive impact on GDP...Boris Johnson with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden at the UN headquarters Image: PAByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Oct | commentsBoris Johnson’s trade deal with New Zealand could either boost the economy by .%… or cut it by .%, analysis last year suggested.The PM and Kiwi counterpart Jacinda Ardern sealed an agreement overnight after  months of talks in a major post-Brexit breakthrough. The Department for International Tradesaid the “groundbreaking” agreement will cut the price of New Zealand sauvignon blanc wine by p - which is its current tarf - and make Manuka honey and kiwi fruits cheaper. It will also create more chances for Britons to live and work in New Zealand - and “deeper cooperation on digital trade and climate change”, the ministry said.However, critics have pointed out DIT’s own -page analysis of its aims for a New Zealand free trade agreement produced in June .It said: “A trade agreement with New Zealand could have limited effects on UK GDP in the long run [ years], with the estimated impact on GDP being close to zero under both scenarios compared to the UK not having a trade deal with New Zealand .” It also suggested agriculture could see a reduction in output and employment, as “UK market access in these sectors increases and resources move towards the expanding sectors.” The analysis did add that the economy would grow overall on a dferent measure known as “Gross Value Added ”, and “productivity gains are expected to drive increases in takehome pay for workers.” But Shadow Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry questioned the benefits of the deal today in the House of Commons. She asked: “Is it correct, as her department says ... that New Zealandaposs exports to the UK will increase by five times as much as UK exports to New Zealand  “And that New Zealandaposs GDP ... will grow by half a billion pounds while the UKaposs GDP will not increase by a single penny ” Trade minister Penny Mordaunt replied: Missing from the right honourable question was any timeframe.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

What the opposition need to appreciate is that we are building these markets. We are increasing these markets and over time those numbers will go up. They will go up because we have given our businesses and our farmers the opportunity to do that. But they will also go up because we have faith in those businesses and farmers thatwe give them those opportunities they will seize them. AskedDIT was still forecasting a cut in “output and employment” for British farmers, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan replied: I am very confident that the deal we have struck will provide the opportunity for our wonderful food producers to continue to sell their goods across the world and, as we make more trade deals, creating new markets for them also. But she refused to be drawn on whether the June  forecast was still correct. UK-New Zealand trade was worth £.billion last year and is expected to grow under the deal.  However, it was unclear what the agreement means for imports of New Zealand lamb. Welsh farmers fear cheap lamb from Down Under on British supermarket shelves could hammer the UK’s sheep farming industry. International Trade Committee Chair, Angus Brendan MacNeil, said: “While the prospect of increased trade with our friends in New Zealand is welcome, the devil of this agreement will be in the detail. “My Committee will be looking underneath the bonnet and kicking the tyres to find out how far the Government has achieved its stated ambitions, exploring whether this represents a good deal for all sectors of the UK economy and all parts of the country.” Comment MORE ON Penny MordauntBoris JohnsonEmily ThornberryInternational TradeHouse of CommonsClimate changeBritish economyThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Health Secretary, who did not wear a face mask in the Commons today, urged people to consider wearing a mask in busy places such as public transport but did not make them compulsory again. At tonightaposs press conference, he said: There are many things we can all do, like wearing face coverings in crowded or close spaces.His comments came just hours after ministers gathered in the Commons for Prime Ministeraposs Questionsand most Tory MPs did not wear a face mask when sitting next to others. Mr Javid came under fire over his colleaguesapos behaviour - and one Tory MPaposs plans to hold a Christmas party - during todayaposs Downing Street press conference.  He responded to a question about their actions contradicting official advice by saying aposI think thataposs a very fair pointapos. Weaposve all got a role to play and set an example to set as private iniduals as well. Itaposs a very fair point and Iaposm sure a lot of people have heard you, he added. Mr Javid added that the Government is not currently planning to implement its Plan B for tackling coronavirus, adding that ministers do not believe the pressures on the NHS are unsustainable at the moment. Responding to questions, he said: “You said, am I sayingwe don’t do our bit, get vaccinated, all those behavioural changes we can make, that we are more likely to face restrictions as we head into winter - then I am saying that. “I think we’ve been really clear that we’ve all got a role to play. “If not enough people get their booster jabs,not enough of those people who were eligible for the original offer - the million that remain unvaccinated -they don’t come forward. “If people don’t wear masks when they really should in a really crowded place with lots of people they don’t normally hang out with. “If they’re not washing their hands and stuff - it’s going to hit us all. and it would of course make it more likely we’re going to have more restrictions.“Now we want to avoid those, we’ve set out what those restrictions might look like, we’ve set out the Plan B restrictions for example, and we all want to avoid those.”In his first-ever Downing Street press conference, Sajid Javid repeated his warning that Covid- cases could reach , a day as the country enters a challenging winter period.He said the UK was seeing greater pressure on the NHS but said the Government will do what it takes to make sure that this pressure doesnapost become unsustainable and that we donapost allow the NHS to become overwhelmed. He said deaths remain mercully low at the moment, even though in the past week almost a thousand people died after contracting the disease. He added: Weaposve always known that the winter months would pose the greatest threat to our road to recovery.  He added: Thanks to the vaccination programme, the link between hospitalisations and deaths has signicantly weakened, but itaposs not broken. So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term and remains a threat to our loved ones, and a threat to the progress that weaposve made in getting our nation closer to normal le. The latest Government figures show that a further  people have died within  days of testing positive for Covid- as of Wednesday. As of am on Wednesday, there have been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK. Hospital admissions stand at  on average per day over the last seven days, up from  a week earlier, a rise of  per cent.  Earlier, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents health bodies, warned that we risk stumbling into a winter crisis unless measures such as face masks and vaccine passports - the Governmentaposs Plan B for the coming months - are introduced in England. He called for ministers to come up with a Plan C of even tougher restrictionsthose measures are insufficient to address pressure on the health service. A behavioural expert has predicted thatthe Government made face masks compulsory again, most people in England would follow the rule.  Professor Linda Bauld said the nation is the outlier in the UK when it comes to coronavirus safety measures, as many aspects included in the Westminster Governmentaposs Plan B are already in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The behavioural scientist, who is Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said the main issue is communication and added that making something mandatory is a big sht which sends a message that people need to comply. Under the Governmentaposs current Plan A strategy, people in England are advised to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings but it is not a legal requirement. Prof Bauld said it is striking and very unfortunate that most Conservative MPs sit in the House of Commons without masks, compared with those on the opposition benches who have generally been seen to wear face coverings. She said: Leaders need to lead by example and with thesenumbers and the concerns we have, absolutely, I think politicians from all parties should be wearing a face covering when theyaposre in the chamber, when they canapost distance etc. Itaposs social norms that drive these behaviours. When you mandate something, itaposs a big sht, it sends a message that itaposs expected and therefore you need to comply unless thereaposs an exception. She added: I think there are some people who feel quite comfortable still wearing one and donapost care what anybody  thinks, but there are others who do , and so, therefore, I think just saying we recommend it but itaposs not required isnapost strong enough. It just doesnapost really work.

The move could mean the p charge on plastic carriers could be replicated for many other things, such as coffee stirrers and straws. Ministers are set to announce the new green powers in the Commons on Wednesday.It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to host the UN COP climate change summit in Glasgow later this month.It is hoped the charges will nudge consumers to use more sustainable items, after the plastic carrier bag charge cut sales in main supermarkets by %. The bill already contained laws to make it easier for ministers to introduce charges on single-use plastics, but the amendments push to introduce charges on all single-use products. “This change to the Environment Bill will mean we can put an end to ‘here-today gone-tomorrow’ throwaway culture and move towards sustainable alternatives,” a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs source has said. The campaign has been led by Labour ’s Shadow Environment Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch, who has been pushing for the change in the Government’s flagship Environment Bill.“This concession is an important first step in reducing our reliance on single-use items, which have an environmental cost whether they are made out of plastic or other materials such as wood, she told The i paper. “While we have welcomed the Government’s incremental bans on certain plastic items, it is clear that ministers need a wider range of tools to tackle the throw-away culture that creates unnecessary waste and litter.” Ruth Chambers of the Greener UK coalition said: “This is very welcome news. “A plastics only measure would have simply moved producers and consumers to single use alternatives that are often unrecyclable. “It is right that the Environment Bill should tackle our throwaway culture head on.” The levy on plastic carrier bags increased to p from p on May  and now applies to every retailer, from giant supermarket chains to corner shops, small clothes boutiques, butchers, greengrocers and airport duty-free stores Before this, the p levy only applied only to shops with more than  staff but it has resulted in the average person in England buying just four bags a year from the big store chains – a massive reduction from  bags each in .

The Labour leader went on: “The government could stop this by making it clear that directors of companies are criminally liable for material on their sites. “We donapost need to delay, so in the collaborative spirit we saw on Monday, will the PM commit to taking this away, looking at it again and working with all of us to strengthen his proposed legislation.” The Prime Minister committed to looking at “anything to strengthen” the long-awaited bill.

From abusive behaviour that causes real damage and shuts down debate to the extremism that spreads terrying ideas and incites people to commit murder. After a three year delay, the Conservatives’ promised draft Bill has finally been published but it’s weak, ineffective and won’t do the job we need it to do.As the testimony from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has shown, making money is all these companies care about.Facebook knew its app was damaging children’s mental health but chose to do nothing. Imaginea drugs company was selling something that made kids sick or a toy firm was selling dangerous a product, they would rightly suffer severe consequences.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  The first change we need in the Bill is to include criminal sanctions against the senior executives of the big companies for repeated breaches of the new law. We need a strong incentive to change the culture of those companies and how they operate. Without personal liability, nothing will change. And we know this works, we have it in health and safety law and in banking. Itaposs not good enough that the Conservatives left this out of their draft Bill.And it should not have taken Keir Starmer to push on this at PMQs for Boris Johnson to perform a U-turn.Another big omission from the Bill is a tough rule around legal but harmful content like racist abuse suffered by our footballers, misogyny suffered by just about any woman in public le and other abuse that makes le a misery but doesn’t hit a criminal threshold.  We need a tough duty of care on the companies which covers all that abuse because it can’t be left up to social media companies to self police it. They have already shown they can’t, or won’t do it voluntarily.After England lost the Euros final, Instagram said that monkey emojis used to attack Saka and other black players did not breach its rules. So self regulation by these companies has had its day. Finally there is a big worry that this Bill has a two tier approach to digital s putting tougher rules in place for the big “category ” sites like Facebook and Twitter but putting less stringent rules in place for the smaller sites.But as Hope Not Hate and the Anti Semitism Policy Trust and others have warned, it’s often the smaller s that host the most terrying and dangerous content with Twitter and Facebook acting as a shop window for the more extreme material. Labour believes this needs to be addressed because excluding these sites from stronger rules is playing into the hands of those who want to spread this dangerous extremism.On Wednesday, under pressure from Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister promised to bring in criminal sanctions and to bring forward the second reading of the Bill before Christmas. We will be holding him to these promises. We need our laws in place as soon as possible and for them to be effective to make all our online lives safer.

Mr Johnson said: “This is a great trade deal for the United Kingdom, cementing our long friendship with New Zealand and furthering our ties with the Indo-Pacic.  “It will benefit businesses and consumers across the country, cutting costs for exporters and opening up access for our workers.” Ms Ardern said: The United Kingdom and New Zealand are great friends and close partners the historical connections that bind us run deep. “This world-leading free trade agreement lays the foundations for even stronger connections as both countries embark on a new phase in our relationship. “It is good for our economies, our businesses and our people. British business leaders hailed the agreement.  Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “New Zealand has long been a priority market for UK’s small exporters – more than a quarter of which already sell there – and we welcome efforts to build on existing trade ties that go back many decades.” Food and Drink Federation international trade chief Dominic Goudie said: “Our manufacturers will benefit from an ambitious trade deal with New Zealand that removes a range of tarfs that currently constrain exports. “Signicant growth opportunities exist as UK production becomes more competitive in the New Zealand market.” But Shadow International Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry claimed the deal would mean job losses for Britain’s farming communities, produce no extra growth and “generate just £million in additional exports for UK firms compared to pre-pandemic levels”.  She said: “As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we need trade deals that will boost jobs and growth, open up big new markets for UK exporters, and support our objectives to buy, make and sell more in Britain. “This trade deal with New Zealand fails on every count. “It is a deal whose only major winners are the mega-corporations who run New Zealand’s meat and dairy farms - all at the expense of British farmers who are already struggling to compete. “But for British jobs, growth and exports, this deal is yet another massive failure.” National Farmers’ Union President Minette Batters said the deal meant Britain “will be opening our doors to signicant extra volumes of imported food - whether or not produced to our own high standards - while securing almost nothing infor UK farmers”.  The pact involves “signicant upsides for farmers on the other side of the world who can now access our hugely valuable market but contains little discernible benefit for UK producers, either at home or overseas”, she warned. Ms Batters feared it could “damage the viability of many British farms in the years ahead, to the detriment of the public, who want more British food on their shelves, and to the detriment of our rural communities and cherished farmed landscapes”. She added: “The Government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON International TradeFederation of Small BusinessesBoris JohnsonRed tapePoliticsAnimalsNew ZealandBrexitAfter BrexitEmily Thornberry\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Queen, Sir David Attenborough, Barack Obama and Joe Biden are just a few of the major figures expected to appear at the summit. Here are the  things you need to know about COP: What is COP  COP stands for ‘conference of the parties’, the annual meeting of the countries that are members of the UN Climate Convention. These meetings have taken place since the convention was set up in Rio, Brazil, in . Since then, negotiators from most countries decide what actions need to be taken under international law to protect the climate.  COP takes place from October  – November  in Glasgow, Scotland, and is the UK’s first time playing host, in partnership with Italy. It was originally planned for November , but the pandemic forced a reschedule. The conference is opening a day earlier than planned, because of Covid-.

The Key points were to keep global temperatures well below .Cabove pre-industrial times and endeavour to limit them even more, to .C. Also to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between  and . So far  countries and the EU have revised their actions - also known as National Determined Contributions . These have to be revisited every five years and COP marks the deadline, which has already been extended as a result of the pandemic. What is hoped to be achieved in Glasgow  It is broadly accepted there are three headline targets for COP: To keep .C in reach by ensuring all major polluters deliver new plans. To deliver a green recovery and finance package for developing countries, including the bn but also plans to fund adaptation and loss  damage.

The projected harm to wildle and ecosystems increases enormously between global heating of .C and anything higher. At C, experts say there will be almost no coral reefs left, the Arctic will be ice-free in summer once a decade and huge numbers of animals and plants will be extinct. The chance of flooding will increase by %. How warm is it now  Temperatures around the world are already at about . – .C above pre-industrial levels, and greenhouse gas emissions are still on an upward trend.  Will this impact the UK Yes. A report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this year said weather events once rare or unprecedented are becoming more common.It said that it will continue evenglobal heating is limited to .C. It also said that climate change is unequivocally being driven by human activity, which fuels these extreme weather patterns. What happensCop fails “COP was always going to be extremely tough, UK PM Boris Johnson told Bloomberg this week.The big players in the talks – the UN, the UK, the US – have already conceded that Cop will not achieve everything that was hoped for as the NDCs likely to emerge will not add up to all that is needed to ensure the world remains within .C.  That is disappointing for many observers, but is not a surprise given the complexity of the negotiations. China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the G nations yet to submit anything pre COP - although to give Ankara credit, they have finally signed up to the Paris Agreement six years after it was agreed What the UK hosts are now focused on is ensuring that there is enough progress on emissions cuts for  to “keep .C alive”, and to pursue as many other routes – phasing out coal, cutting methane and setting a path away from fossil fuels for transport etc. November Rain Tensions are rising as Cop approaches with rail workers and waste collectors going on strike, Airbnb are screwing over customers who have already booked accommodation in the city by asking for more money and Covid rates are rising.  Speaking for a planet, even the Queen piled in: “It is very irritating when they talk, but they donapost do,” she said, in a nod to national climate plansyet to land. Can I go to COP  Yes and no. In order to attend, only accredited delegates, media and politicians will have access to what is known as the Blue Zone - the area of venue managed by the UN.COPs also have a green zone, managed by the Presidency, with events for the wider public.

With the addition of delays in the booster jab rollout, as well as immunity waning and a new Delta iant in the UK, it is feared restrictions may have to .But in the question is, what kind and when  What is the government’s plan to tackling Covid this winter   The government previously announced a Plan A and Plan B to tackle the spread of Covid- this winter, though the latter has yet to kick in. Plan A includes booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, offering a first dose to  to -year-olds and advice to wear masks in enclosed spaces. Much of this is underway already but nevertheless infections are still rising at an alarming rate Plan A includes no additional restrictions introduced over winter, meaning there is no limit to how many people you can meet, and pubs and restaurants wonapost be closed. The government are hoping to avoid addition restricting by relying on the Covid booster jabs programme, which is being offered to around  million people, including the over s, younger adults with health conditions, and frontline health and social care workers. The NHS Test and Trace will continue, as well as the offer of free PCR test for those who have symptoms of Covid-. The government is also encouraging those who are being offered the flu jab to take it up. Brits are also being reminded to wear face coverings in crowded places, and let fresh in when meeting indoors, although this is not mandatory. According to government documents, in the event that “Plan A is not sufficient in keeping the virus at manageable levels”, Plan B will go ahead. However they have yet to make clear what the tipping point for this will be. What is Plan B   Plan B would involve theof mandatory masks, including in schools. According to the governmentaposs Autumn and Winter Plan document: If Plan B is implemented, the Government will bring back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. The precise settings will be decided at the time. In addition, schools will be handed a contingency framework for what to dovirus cases surge. This could involve theof bubbles. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues could be activated at a weekaposs notice. Under Plan B, the government would also consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. The document states: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions, so a final decision would be made based on the data at the time. Clear guidance and communications will be issued to the public and businesses, setting out the steps they should take to manage the increased risks of the virus, although itaposs not yet clear what this would involve.To find out more about Plan B, you can read our separate guide here.Will there be another lockdown this winter   Do you think Plan A will work  Let us know in the comments below. The government has said itaposs very unlikely that the nation will go into lockdown. This is due to the success of the Covid vaccination programme, which will hopefully reduce transmission and relieve pressure on the NHS. The government is hoping that by outlining Plan A and Plan B, there wonapost be a need for a national lockdown this winter. However, although ministers expect Plan B measures to be sufficient to avoid a signicant increase in infections, there is no guarantee another lockdown is off the table. Dr Quinton Fivelman, Chief Scientic Officer at London Medical Laboratory, warned thatnumbers continue to increase the government would be forced to introduce a non-existent Plan C. However, the government has insisted lockdown would be a last resort. Speaking about the Covid lockdown plan on BBC Breakfast, Mr Javid said: No one wants to see another lockdown, I certainly don’t. I don’t think we are going to need to see another lockdown. I think the vaccines are working. “But I think it would be irresponsible for any health minister in the world to say that this or that is % ruled out. “Not least because I just don’t know whether at some time in the future – next year, the year after, the year after that – there might be a vaccine escape iant that doesn’t work with the current suite of vaccines.” Comment MORE ON NHSPlan BSchoolsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Angela Artis, , was travelling back to Charlotte, in the US, with husband Darien and son Mason when they were forced off the plane at Heathrow where they were making a connection. Their holiday to Santorini, in Greece, where the couple were renewing their wedding vows, turned sour on thevia Heathrow. After being removed from the American Airlines flight  last Sunday, the airline provided overnight accommodation and rebooked the Artis family onto the following day’s flight. Mrs Artis claimed it was impossible to keep a mask on a two-year-old and that there was a baby near them that wasn’t forced to wear a face covering.  She said having got on board the plane initially everything was fine with the flight crew and her son was even given a lollipop. It turned sour, she claimed, when another flight attendant came over.She told the: “But about  minutes before the flight was due to take off another attendant came over and pointed a finger at my baby. She said aposhe needs to put a mask on or he’s got to go” in a very rude way.Mrs Artis said that her heart dropped as she had no idea it was a strict policy because she claimed that she had been able to travel before without him wearing a mask. Mrs Artis added that other flight crew in the past have accepted it is not feasible to keep the mask on a two-year-old “for more than five minutes”. She said: We had tried to put it on him for the first few minutes but he just couldn’t keep it on, it’s dficult for a baby to even physically breathe with a mask on. She said that the plane then taxied back to the terminal and the family was forced to get off the plan with an announcement that it was due to a child not wearing a mask. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Transportation Security Administration directives mean that American Airlines requires passengers aged two and older to wear face coverings at all times while indoors at airports and onboard. In a statement, the airline said: On Oct. , American Airlines flight  ed to the gate prior to departure from London Heathrow to deplane a party failing to comply with the face mask requirement. After agreeing to comply with the face mask requirement, all iniduals were rebooked for travel on the next flight to Charlotte the following day.

Other requirements for the job, which involves looking after children aged two to five, includes having eyes in the back of your head and offering big, warm hugs whenever required. The viral advert reads: You must be comfortable about entering public places on your way home from work with unknown substances on your clothing.

Police chiefs said plain clothes officers were likely to be deployed in nightclubs although womensapos groups warned some women struggled to trust forces in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs murderer.Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an urgent update from police following harrowing reports of women being injected at nightclubs across the country.Universities have said they are working with bars and police to help ensure studentsapos safety after the reports.Have you been affected by this story  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Campaigners call for changes to make night venues safer Groups from more than  universities around the UK have joined an online campaign calling for the boycott of nightclubs. Campaigners say they are seeking tangible changes to make night-time venues safer, such as covers stoppers for drinks, better training for staff and more rigorous searches of clubbers. A petition to make it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search guests on entry, started last week, has already gained more than , signatures. The National Union of Students issue statement Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students , said: Itaposs absolutely disgusting that in the past few days a number of students have reported instances of women being spiked on nights out. My rage, love and solidarity goes out to all those who have been impacted by these violent acts, and all other women and marginalised folks who experience sexual violence on our campuses and in our communities. One studentaposs story A student has told how she believes she was spiked with an injection during a night out with friends as police say reports of spiking are on the rise.Zara Owen, , from Surrey, who is a student at the University of Nottingham, said she went for a night out with friends last Monday but then blacked out soon after arriving at a venue.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: I went out with my friends to a nightclub in the city - nothing more than what we would usually do. I remember going to the bar, going to the toilet, going to the photobooth, and then after that moment my memory is a blank until I get home and Iaposm getting my phone charger. I know I didnapost drink as much as I usually would on a night out this night, and the fact that I donapost remember anything is terrying for me because this is something that is a very rare occasion to me.  Iaposve never suffered with memory loss and then the next morning, obviously I did with the memory loss, I woke up with a really painful leg. I found a pin prick in my leg which was the epicentre of all pain. It made me unable to walk and I was limping around. As a young person whoaposs at university, Iaposm hearing stories of people who have been to nightclubs and they have been injected. I have heard stories of someone having it through their hand or through their back so this kind of gave me an idea this had happened to me. Ms Owen added she was afraid that she may have contracted a diseasea dirty needle had been used. What did the university say  A University of Nottingham spokesperson said: We are extremely concerned by these reports - no-one should feel unsafe on a night out. We are working closely with Nottinghamshire Police and the cityaposs nightle venues to monitor, review and learn from incidents and experiences in the city centre. We have contacted them about the specic concerns raised and will continue to liaise with them to actively tackle societal problems and challenge behaviours.The NHS website provides some guidelines on what to doyour skin has been punctured with a used needle. They advise to aposwash the wound using running water and plenty of soapapos, aposdry the wound and cover it with a waterproof plaster or dressingapos and to not scrub the wound or suck any blood. Nottingham Policeaposs websites has some guidance on what to doyour drink has been spiked, but they currently do not have any guidelines on being injected. They advise to: Tell the people you’re with and make sure you’re someone where you feel safe. Alert a member of staff at the pub or club you are at. If you feel unwell you should seek medical attention immediately and tell them that you believe your drink has been spiked.Police in Nottinghamshire investigateNottinghamshire Police has seen a rising number of reports of spiking over recent months and are now stepping up operations to tackle the problem. Superintendent Kathryn Craner said: Over the last few months we have seen an increase in reports where people believe that drugs may have been put in their drink - thataposs due to the fact that they have experienced a distinctly dferent feeling to their normal reaction to alcohol. But weaposve also received a small number of reports where people are telling us, as Zara has, that this has been associated with a pain or a mark on a part of their body, scratching sensation, and as though they have been physically spiked. The force has arrested a man as part of the wider operation to tackle spiking in Nottingham. Police Scotland also investigate reports Police are investigating reports of people being spiked by injection in the Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen areas. It follows reports on social media about people being targeted inside venues in Scotland. Police Scotland said a small number of reports from the four areas are being investigated but do not appear to be linked. The force has also received a report of a drink-spiking incident at a venue in the Stirling area and inquiries are ongoing. A Police Scotland spokesman said: We are aware of posts circulating on social media about spiking incidents involving injections in Scotland. Officers are carrying out inquiries, and a small number of reports from the Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen areas are being investigated. These do not appear to be linked. We take all reports seriously and we would encourage anyone who believes they have been a victim of spiking in any form to contact police via .  What politicians are saying about the issue“ These are obviously vile crimes,” said Commons Home Affairs Select Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper.Ms Cooper, a former Shadow Home Secretary, said she received a report today from a victim who attended a hospital casualty unit last night “as a result of a possible injection spiking”. The victim “referred to there being three other people who were in the AE at the same time for spiking more widely, who were unable to walk as a result of drink spiking”.Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an urgent update from police following harrowing reports of women being injected at nightclubs across the country.A Home Office source said: Weaposve asked the police to look into whataposs going on. We need to understand the scale of the problem. The thought of whataposs going on is just horrendous. What are the experts saying about it Some experts have cast doubt the use of needle spiking being a widespread phenomenon due to multiple iables such as the size of needle needed, the amount of liquid to cause an effect as well as the medical know-how needed to perform the injection.Guy Jones, senior scientist at drugs charity the Loop, told VICE World News: “GHB would be a poor candidate for injection due to the large amount of fluid needed, and therefore the thick, painful needle. This means that the substance involved would be something that would be highly detectable for several days in a toxicology screening such as a benzodiazepine.”David Caldicott, an emergency medicine consultant and founder of drug testing project WEDINOS, also said: “There are a couple of things that are disconcerting about this story. The technical and medical knowledge required to perform this would make this deeply improbable. It is at the level of a state-sponsored actor incapacitating a dissident, like the Novichok incident. The idea that a clubber would do this to a fellow clubber seems highly unlikely to me.

Crews had been called terried by the figure, thinking someone was hanging.When he let the -strong crew in they told him they were investigating reports of a concern for welfare.  Have you got a story youaposd like us to cover  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorThe man who has asked not to be named says: I was asleep in bed when I got a call from concierge to say the police were on their way up. I jumped out of bed in a scare I just totally panicked, I didnapost know what was going on, my kids were in the other room I had to check they were okay. I had police, paramedics, officers all come in. I switched on the lights and within minutes they realised it was the Iron Man sculpture and they just said aposwowapos and aposthataposs coolapos. The next thing they were taking selfies with it. It seems surreal now, but at the time it was really scary.  The man has lived in the flat for a year and said the sculpture has never caused any problems before now. Police officers told the man he should now move the sculpture as aposthe same thing could happen againapos, but he says itaposs simply too heavy. In a video from the scene, a police officer is heard saying: You need to move it, weaposll just keep getting calls. The homeowner is a fan of the Iron Man movies starring Robert Downey Jr, and bought the mammoth £, sculpture just before lockdown which features flashing eyes, chest and hands.  He says: Iaposve been here a year and no one has ever complained about the statue before. I mean we are really high up here. The officers were saying: you need to move Iron Manapos but itaposs just too heavy to do that. It was custom built and touches the ceiling. I just really like Iron Man and this lights up and everything, itaposs cool, I wanted it as a feature for the apartment. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: At around pm last night , police were called to reports of a concern for welfare on Deansgate, Manchester. Emergency services attended and established that there was no cause for concern. West Tower is one of the four huge new apartment blocks that has been built at the far end of Deansgate in the city centre as part of the Deansgate Square cluster. It boasts apartments spread across  floors, while the neighbouring South Tower is the largest of the four towers rising to  floors.

Betty finally decided she was brave enough to approach a handler offering a tasty treat on the st day of her stay at DogsRescue in Worsley. Bettyaposs transformation was slow but incredible, and the sweet moment was captured on video, the Manchester Evening News reports.The shelter wrote in a video caption: “Betty taking a treat from our hands. This moment has been  days in the making. “Probably the most broken rehab dog we have taken, her transformation whilst slow is incredible.  Moments like this are golden. We are so proud of you Betty.” Later that day they shared the full video, and said: “Betty taking a treat. She’s sat and watched other dogs do this thousands of times. Love, kindness, time and patience pay off in the end. “This was on her st day at our rescue. All in your own time, beautul girl. There’s no clock ticking on how long you can stay here.” In the video, the handler stays calm and still, offering out the treat while Betty is seen looking around tentatively, starting to approach several times, before doubling back, taking a few steps backwards, and then starting again. She then seemingly surveys the area to make sure that the coast is clear before walking up steadily towards the handler, finally taking the treat very gently before beating a hasty retreat. The tweet has gained more than , likes and nearly  comments, with users praising the rescue for allowing Betty to overcome her fears at her own pace. DogsRescue was founded by Emma in  with the aim to rehabilitate dogs across Europe and the UK to homes in the Manchester area. They pride themselves on being a kennel free environment, and believe in ‘pack rehabilitation’, allowing the dogs to enjoy a lestyle where they can exercise and socialise with the other animals, gaining confidence from each other, before eventually being rehomed.  One user said: “That is so beautul to see but I can’t help thinking what the beautul baby has been through to be so frightened. “Thank you so much for your patience and perseverance. You guys are truly amazing.” Another commented: “Bless her, so thankful to you for giving her the opportunity to express herself at her own pace without the time pressure of finding a home. “Thank you for the wonderful work you do.” A third said: “Breaks my heart to see her check her escape route first. Thank goodness she has you guys.”In a further post on Twitter, the rescue said: “Betty is a smart, sweet dog who was unbelievably afraid. It was unthinkable to us to end the le of a healthy dog just because they need time and patience.“It’s a privilege to be on this confidence building journey with her and watch her blossom into a happy member of our pack.” Comment MORE ON FitnessAnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Previous iants of the coronavirus have wreaked havoc as they can spike infection rates across the country.Health experts from the NHS are now encouraging the government to enact its contingency plan for further restrictions, which may include another lockdown. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said in response: This time last year we didnapost have the vaccine. We donapost want to go back into lockdown and further restrictions. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: As you know it’s something we’re keeping a very close eye on because of the strength of our genomic capability we are able to keep a very close watch on any iants that are emerging.What is the new Delta plus Covid iant  The new coronavirus iant, known as AY.., is an offshoot of the Delta strain, which is dominant across the world.Viruses mutate and change to fight against the antibodies that learn to kill them. It means immunity to viruses are often hard to keep up with. Some virus iants are more easily spread and can be more infectious. Some strains are also known to be more severe. Is the New Delta strain more transmissible  It is currently unclearthe new iant is indeed more severe or infectious. Tests are currently underway in an attempt to determine this. However, according to Dr Jeffrey Barrett, the director of the Covid- Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, and Prof Francois Balloux, the director of the University College London Genetics Institute, AY.. could be -% more transmissible than the original iant. He told the Financial Times: Its potential higher transmissibility could at this stage only explain a tiny fraction of additional cases. “It’s around % frequency [now], and assuming it may be % more transmissible, that would only explain an additional % extra infections [every five or so days].  However, the PMaposs spokesperson said: Thereaposs no evidence to suggest this iant, which I think is the AY. you are referring to, is more easily spread. There’s no evidence for that but as you would expect we’re monitoring it closely and won’t hesitate to take actionnecessary.” Thereaposs no evidence provided to us that we have seen that suggests it is more easily spread. Will the Covid vaccine still work  Experts say at this early stage, it is unlikely the new iant will escape the current vaccines. Tests are currently under way to establish how big of a threat this new iant poses. The Covid- Genomics UK Consortium , which tracks new iants, said the new iant “is likely to become dominant” in Britainit is found to be more infectious. However, it said there is no evidence to support this yet. More recently experts have argued there is a case for a Delta-specic vaccine, according to The Independent.

The Pack Horse, which is in the Peak District village of Hayfield, was visited by a group who didnapost complain when staff came and checked on them after they got their food. Staff say that the group chose to complain once theyaposd eaten most of the meal.The group allegedly tried to ask for a new dish, which was refused, and eventually left without paying the bill, Manchester Evening News reports. Owner and chef Luke Payne said that one member of the group then had the nerve to wink at him as they left. Were the diners right to leave  Have your say in the comments  The pub takes card details at the time of booking in case of no-shows or walk-outs, but the group reportedly said they would cancel their cards. Luke said the ordeal was immensely frustrating for him and his staff. He said: They were perfectly pleasant to begin with and then everything just changed. After theyaposd eaten about  per cent of the food, a lady brought her plate up to the bar and said it wasnapost to her liking, wasnapost what she expected, and could she swap to another meal for free   To which I said aposNoapos, because sheaposd eaten most of it and we canapost give food away for free when itaposs just personal preference. Thataposs not really how it works. Luke said his small team had already checked in with the group of customers and there were no complaints made about their food. When the group threatened to not pay their bill, Luke said he told them: aposThataposs not really acceptable, youaposve eaten most it, and you were given the opportunity to say there was something wrong with it.apos  He added: If theyaposd flagged it up in the check-back we could have done something to recty it. We donapost actively like making people unhappy, itaposs our job for people to have a really good night. We love people leaving with a buzz and knowing theyaposve had a great time with us, and  per cent of the people we have in are absolutely lovely and have a great time. We put in so much effort and passion and love, so every negative comment is taken personally. We will always do our utmost to fix a problemsomething is wrong -weaposve made a mistake weaposll hold our hands up and weaposll own it. So in an instance where absolutely nothing is wrong and people have kicked off, it hurts. The Pack Horse is one of the North Westaposs leading and most respected gastropubs, earning itself a place in the Estrella Dam Gastropubs list. Luke says that business has been great since they were able to reopen their doors after lockdown, but he says the post-pandemic kindness is fading. He said: I feel like there was a point in the pandemic where everyone was like aposBe kind, be nice. But Iaposve certainly noticed over the last couple of weeks that thereaposs been more stressed-out people with shorter tempers, and I know that thereaposs a lot of hard times for people at the moment, but it doesnapost take much to be nice to others. It was such a great opportunity to have that societal reset but I think some people have slipped back into their old ways. Business has been great, weaposve been so thankful for all the support weaposve had and weaposve been practically full every single weekend.

The -year-old monarch was feeling “a little tired” on Tuesday evening, before royal doctors were called to her living quarters at Windsor Castle, it is understood. Upon waking on Wednesday morning, ahead of a planned departure from her Berkshire home at midday to travel to Belfast, the steely Queen was said to be “showing slight signs of a seasonal cold”.Her Majesty, who has had a jam packed schedule of engagements since ing from her summer break at Balmoral, took covid test which confirmed she was not suffering from coronavirus. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up But palace medics advised her to take a period of “immediate rest” for the next few days. The nation’s longest reigning monarch is resting at Windsor Castle but will still receive her ministerial red boxes which she will attend to. She is still expected at this stage to host a reception in Glasgow on November  for the Cop climate change conference. Several engagements in her diary for next week remain as yet unchanged, but courtiers said they would maintain a “cautious view” with any plans. The Queen was set to attend a series of engagements at Hillsborough Castle on Wednesday and Thursday attend a service in St Patrick’s Church, Armagh to commemorate the centenary of the foundation of Northern Ireland. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days.  “Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. “The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future.” It emerged this week that the Queen turned down the ‘Oldie of the Year’ trophy because she feels she does not meet the criteria, believing “you are only as old as you feel”. Despite her period of rest to take it easy, the Queen was spotted on Wednesday driving around the Windsor estate and enjoying taking her dogs for a walk. A royal source said: “The Queen’s enthusiasm for ing to a fully packed schedule of engagements following the coronavirus restrictions being lted has been incredibly admirable. “There is certainly no cause for alarm.  “Her Majesty doesn’t know any other pace than full on and used to being incredibly busy, especially of late, but perhaps it is in her best interests that she takes this time to rest and recuperate before she starts once again.” Courtiers believe the cancellation of the Queen’s trip will serve as a reminder that the head of state - at the age of  - cannot do what was expected of her  or  years ago. In recent weeks she has for the first time been seen walking with a stick at public engagements. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said the Queen’s autumn schedule had been more crammed than expected, but last-minute cancellations were inevitable in the future. Since the Queen ed from Balmoral Castle at the start of October, she has met Canadian troops at Windsor, launched the Queen’s Baton Relay for the Commonwealth Games, attended the Royal British Legion centenary service at Westminster Abbey, travelled to Cardf for the Welsh Senedd opening, and hosted a global investment summit reception, as well as holding audiences and video calls.  Mr Little said: “I think when you get to the age of  and you have a role such as the Queen has, there is an inevitability about last-minute cancellations. “Unfortunately, I think this is just how it’s going to have to be from time to time. “The fact that she has been busy and seemingly healthy and happy of late shows that clearly looks can be deceptive unless something has happened overnight.” He added: “Mentally, the Queen is pin sharp as ever and when she makes speeches she speaks well. “But you notice that the body is perhaps a little bit less so. “Every now and again there will be this reminder that she is  and she can’t do what was expected of her ,  years ago.  Just five years away from her th birthday and next year due to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee -  years on the throne, the nation’s longest reigning monarch still keeps a busy diary of events and audiences and deals with her daily red boxes of official papers. She held two audiences on Tuesday via video link from Windsor Castle, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida, followed by a reception for business leaders including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in the evening. At the weekend, she enjoyed a day at the races at Ascot, and on Monday held a virtual audience with the new Governor-General of New Zealand. Royal sources said the Queen’s “enthusiasm to get on with the job” has shown now sign of letting up, but most conceded she would be advised to “take her foot off the gas” to maintain her health. It was revealed last week that Her Majesty had taken the “personal decision” to give up regular drinking by her doctors as she keeps up a busy schedule ahead of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations.  Due to her age the Queen is expected to have had her Covid booster jab, following her first inoculation in January.At the time she broke with protocol to announce she had been given her first injection, alongside husband Prince Philip, from a royal doctor at Windsor Castle.The head of state made the personal decision to let it be known she had accepted the vaccine to send a “message of hope” to the country, as Britain reaches a crisis point in the battle against coronavirus.

Her Majesty, , was forced to cancel her two-day trip to Northern Ireland after being advised take some time out of her schedule. She pulled out of the trip just five hours before she was due to arrive. Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days. “Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. “The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future.” The Northern Ireland trip was cancelled so last minute palace staff were already waiting in Belfast, the Mail Online reports.  A royal source said of the Queen: With her Platinum Jubilee on the horizon, many are thinking that perhaps her private office needs to look at the diary again. Another source added: No one is saying that she should take a step back, but perhaps another slight step to one side might be in order.  It has been confirmed that the monarch is not sick due to Covid-, and that she simply needed to rest after a busy schedule and weeks of travelling. This week the Queen welcomed guests following Boris Johnsonaposs investment summit. She met with business leaders, tech entrepreneurs and politicians, including the the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. The monarch also recently ed from a summer in Balmoral, and opened the Welsh Senedd last week. Over the weekend, she had attended the Ascot races and on Monday met with new governor-general of New Zealand virtually.Also last week, the Queen had attended a service at Westminster Abbey for the Royal British Legion, where she was spotted with a walking stick for the first time. The Palace has insisted that there is nothing to be concerned about and that her doctor instructed her to rest.  The Northern Ireland trip would have seen the Queen attend a service marking the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland. She was also due to visit Hillsborough Castle, which was renamed to the Royal Hillsborough Castle, and would have met with some pandemic heroes. This is not the first time the Queen has been forced to cancel a trip. In January of last year, she was due to visit the Womenaposs Institutebranch in Sandringham, Norfolk but did not attend due to ill health. She was also forced to cancel her appearance at an event at St Pauls in London in June  because she was feeling ill.

The cost for the accommodation is £ per week and include service charges for cleaners and usage of the lt. Julie Baker is a long term resident at St Margaret’s having lived there for  years. She has been left frustrated by the most recent leaks, with a bin full of water being left outside her flat.Julie told the Manchester Evening News : The outside of my flat is disgusting and theyaposve told me they want to come in and dig the kitchen floor up, while Iaposm still in there, because they say thereaposs a pipe underneath thataposs cracked. We have a cleaner that we pay for but they werenapost even here half an hour today and I still have to mop the floor myself in laundry room. Itaposs disgraceful really because weaposre all vulnerable in one way or another. My mum hasnapost come to visit since Iaposve been here because sheaposs embarrassed of the place.

Another resident who has lived in the building for nine years has reported numerous times regarding a mice infestation in his property but claims that it has not been resolved. He said: Iaposve still got them now, I can feel them at night. They tell me Iaposm leaving food about but all my food are in plastic containers in the fridge or freezer. Itaposs the st century, it shouldnapost be like this.  Phil used to live in Julieaposs flat but he had to move out as it was, in his words, p***ing water. He has since moved into Julieaposs old flat, which has been left semi-decorated. Itaposs angin mate, he said. We just want somewhere nice to live. Iaposm basically just living in my bedroom. Theyaposve not done anything to the flat since I moved in. I had an electrician round the other day to sort something out and even though there were two other simple jobs I asked him to do, he said he couldnapost due it because it had to be logged. You complain but they just tell you that youaposre imagining things. Eventually their concerns were put across to the housing association and since then, they have apologised to the residents for aposfalling below the standards they deserveapos and promised to carry out full inspections.  Joanne Scarlett, Riverside’s head of asset strategy and delivery, blamed a roof leak for some of the problems the residents have faced. She said: We apologise unreservedly to our retirement living customers at St Margaret’s Gardens in Oldham. We take all complaints extremely seriously and our team are speaking to customers to discuss progress in resolving the issues they’ve experienced and how we can come to a speedy resolution. We will also carry out a full inspection of each inidual apartment over the coming days and weeks. The root of the problem is a leak in a glass roof in the reception area. We have also been renewing guttering for this roof, where drainage had been blocked and water was backing up, causing a range of issues which have affected customers’ properties.

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes had more than six spoons worth of salt in his system at the time of his death in June last year, a court heard. Consultant pathologist Dr Roger Malcolmson told a murder trial at Coventry Crown Court it was aposhighly unlikelyapos the boy poisoned himself. Thomas Hughes, aged , and his then-girlfriend Emma Tustin, , stand accused of killing his son Arthur at their home in Cranmore Road, Shirley. They both deny murder and multiple counts of child cruelty.  Giving evidence today - Tuesday, October  - Dr Malcolmson stated it was aposmore likelyapos Arthur was aposrepeatedly poisoned with salt contaminated food or fluidsapos in aposbrutal controlling circumstancesapos. He told the court it was less likely he was given a single portion of salt shortly before he collapsed at the Shirley home on June . Asked whether his raised sodium levels, combined with dehydration, would have contributed to Arthur being aposless physically able to resist a fatal assaultapos the expert witness said: Thataposs my suggestion, yes. If he had been suffering health side effects from being poisoned to the extent he is likely to have been in this case, then yes he may not have been able to put up much of a fight.  Dr Malcolmson had earlier told the jury that Arthur suffered apossevereapos eye injures, including a detached retina, aposvery rarely seenapos in child head trauma cases. The expert described them as apostowards the extreme endapos of the scale and put them down to apossevere blunt force traumaapos to Arthuraposs head. He said: At minimum, there has been a very signicant head impact, there may have also been a shaking-type mechanism.  Dr Malcolmson reiterated his belief that the cause of Arthuraposs death was a head injury which could not have been self inflicted because the boy would not have been able to generate enough force himself, the court heard. The court also heard that Arthuraposs left kidney was aposextremely smallapos while his thymus lymphoid organ in his chest appeared to have shrunk. Dr Malcolmson stated the latter was likely caused by apossevere and or prolonged physical stressapos and confirmed it could have been brought on by aposrepeated and sustained abuseapos.  It is alleged Tustin and Hughes aposisolated Arthur from the familyapos, aposassaulted himapos, aposdeprived him of water and made him stand in the hallway where he spent up to  hours a dayapos, the court was previously told. They both deny murder. Tustin has admitted one child cruelty offence but denies three others. Hughes denies all four counts.

A man has been arrestedEllie SImpson, whose sister was targeted in a Nottingham nightclubByCallum Parke:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A man has been arrested days after a young woman was allegedly injected with a needle in a nightclub. The victim was rushed to AE and spent the night in hospital after the terrying incident, which allegedly happened last Tuesday in Nottingham. Ellie Simpson, the womanaposs sister, said her sibling was with friends in Stealth nightclub when she felt a pinching or scratching sensation on the back of her arm. She began to feel ill, and was taken to AE, where she spent the night on a drip.Ellie told Derbyshire Live that her sister, who studies in Nottingham but is from Derby, has been left seriously shaken by the experience. She said: Sheaposs OK now, but sheaposs still really shaken up and afraid to go out. She went out for a night out and had only had a couple of drinks, so had drank less than she would normally. They were trying to leave the club and on the way out she felt something on the back of her arm, a pinching or scratching sensation, and she canapost remember anything after that. The police took urine samples so I donapost knowthey will be able to find anything. I felt sick, because you see these things happen to other people. You never expect to have it happen to anybody that you know. And then I obviously felt angry, and you just question why, why does somebody want to do that  What were their intentions  Iaposm just thankful she was with a friend becauseshe wasnapost, what would have happened  Spiking is the act of adding alcohol or a drug to food or drink without the knowledge of the person who consumes it. Reports of spikings have been re across the country in recent weeks, with particular concern about the use of needles given the risk of infection with HIV.It is recommended by the NHS that anyone concerned about contracting HIV should use soap to clean the wound, and buy anti-HIV medication within  hours of the incident.Signs that a drink may have been tampered with include a foggy appearance, excessive bubbles, sinking ice or a change in colour. If someone has been spiked, it is recommended to tell a member of staff and to ensure someone stays with the victim, calling an ambulancetheir condition deteriorates. It is important to ensure they do not travel on their own, or drink more alcohol. But Ellie, who has herself been spiked while studying in Loughborough, says women can only do so much to protect themselves and that more should be done to create a safe environment for everyone. She said: Ever since that [Ellie being spiked], my sister has been a lot more conscious in terms of putting your hands over your drink. But when itaposs a needle, how do you stop that  You canapost. Unless you go out in a suit of armour, which weaposre not going to do. Evenyou do search people, itaposs like looking for a needle in a haystack. I personally I donapost know how youaposd go about stopping it, as metal detectors may not pick needles up as theyaposre so small. As women, we shouldnapost have to go out on a night out, thinking have I got my bag, have I got my keys, then thinking, am I safe to go out, am I going to get spiked tonight  It shouldnapost be like that. Boycotts of nightclubs across the country have been organised over the next fortnight in protest. Using the name aposGirls Nights Inapos, events are happening in Derby and Nottingham on Wednesday, October , to coincide with Wednesday nights often being busy student nights, with similar happening across the country into early November. But Ellie has said that anyone, including men, are welcome and encouraged to become part of the campaign for greater awareness and protection in clubs. To other men it must seem like we are blaming them, even though we know it is not all men. I suppose in a club environment, the only sort of way I would feel safe isyou could see a manaposs hands and know where they are, but how you do that  And you shouldnapost have to do that. But weaposre keen to say itaposs not all men. Nottinghamshire police have said that a -year-old man has been arrested after receiving reports of a number of incidents in recent days. He has since been released on bail. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A and class B drugs and cause to administer poison or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve and annoy following an incident in Lower Parliament Street on October , four days after Ellieaposs sister was spiked.A petition for greater security checks for nightclubs has also reached over , signatures, surpassing the threshold needed for the matter to be debated in Parliament.

Locals shared photos of damage to their gardens, including a smashed brick wall and toppled furniture. Four people had to be rescued from the roof of their car after it became swamped.  They were left balancing on the top of the vehicle that was stuck in four feet of fast flowing water at St Kew, Cornwall.Police were first on the scene just before .pm and then called in Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service.Crews from Wadebridge and Delabole were sent along with water rescue units from St Austell and Bude, supported by an Area manager and group manager.  Londoners complained of “terrying” journeys home on Wednesday night. One person tweeted: “The rain tonight coming back from London was the worst I’ve seen in a long time. Loads of deep flooding from Hammersmith through to the M.” Another wrote: “Terrying drive home from West London to Rochester, Medway. Torrential rain all the way with flooding and stranded vehicles along the route. Still raining...”  People across the south of the country woke up to tumultuous scenes of flooding this morning after a storm moving in from France brought with it strong winds and heavy rains. Storm Aurore was expected to dump mm of rain and blow mph winds in the worst affected areas. The Met Office issued a yellow rain warning covering most of southern England for Wednesday night and into Thursday, meaning people living there could see transport delays, flooding and power issues. The Met Office issued yellow rain warnings for the southern counties and Channel Islands until am on Thursday, but said the most severe impact of the storm would be over northern France.  It added the unsettled weather was likely to continue for the rest of the week, with showers and breezy conditions across western Scotland and some areas of central and northern England and Wales on Friday. Forecasters predict there to be more persistent rain over the weekend, with the heaviest rain expected in western Scotland, where -mm could fall in  hours. Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales, could see up to mm of rain, while southern and central areas will see light rain.

A court heard the plastic-wrapped bundles of notes were found in several shopping bags during a police raid at the home of Pero Mitrovic in Kensington, London, where he rented out a room to Milan Kosoric. Officers also found just over g of cocaine and drugs paraphernalia at the property and in a parked car outside. Prosecutor Tim Hunter told Maidstone Crown Court that the amount of cash found plainly doesnapost equate to the small quantity of the class A drug which had been ided into  deals. Both men, who have no previous convictions in the UK or their native country, admitted possessing criminal property in respect of the cash on a jointly owned basis.  Mitrovic, , was jailed on October  for  months and -year-old Kosoric, who also pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was sentenced to a total of four years and three monthsapos imprisonment. The flat in Redclfe Street was raided on March  this year and the cash totalling £, was found in Kosoricaposs rear bedroom. Mr Hunter said: The cash was bundled up and marked into separate amounts and kept in a iety of robust supermarket shopping aposbags for leapos. Police also found six bags containing the vast majority of drug deal bags, a sealing machine and money counter. A further  cocaine wraps were found in a VW car. Craig Rush, defending Kosoric, said he had been entrusted by those further up the chain to act as a storekeeper for the drugs and money. Tony Wyatt, defending Mitrovic, told the court he knew the money was related to crime but not that it came from drug trafficking.He added: He could and should have put a stop to what was happening and ask his co-defendant to leave the flat. However, Judge Charles Gratwicke said it beggared belief that on seeing the money and paraphernalia he would not have known what was going on. Passing sentence, he told Mitrovic: You clearly must have been aware of the criminal activity that was going on, you clearly were permitting that criminal activity to take place, and there is little doubt that there was to be some personal gain.  Jailing Kosoric, Judge Gratwicke added he had played an active role in the illicit operation. Class A drugs bring with them nothing but misery, degradation and occasionally death to those who become addicted, he said. Those who prey upon the addiction class A drugs bring can expect to receive immediate prison sentences to reflect societyaposs abhorrence of the evil trade and to deter others. Detective Superintendent Lee Morton of Kent Police who investigated the case, said: Kosoric and Mitrovic both occupied key roles in an organised criminal network, and whilst both of them may not have directly orchestrated the drug supply chains running into Kent, they had clearly been entrusted to look after and redistribute vast sums of criminal cash. Both men have now rightly been jailed and the fact that we have been able to successfully and permanently seize all the money is equally important. Some of the work we do can take months of painstaking investigation but it is important that people see that we wonapost allow criminals to benefit from their illegal activity. Any ill-gotten cash will be taken from them and where possible redistributed to our local communities for everyoneaposs benefit.

Megalodons, meaning aposbig toothapos, are a now-extinct shark species that once swam in the Earthaposs waters. They are believed to have lived from about  to . million years ago, from the Early Miocene to the Pliocene eras. Captain Michael Nastasio, from the city of Venice in Sarasota County, found the    inchestooth just off the coast of his home city, while on a shark-tooth chartering trip with his company: Black Gold Fossil Charters. The area is noted for the shark teeth found on the local sea bed. While Michael has found many other shark teeth in the past, he said he would be keeping this one due to how impressive it was.  He said: I have been fossil hunting for almost  years, and running my own charter now for a little over a year. I have found thousands of Megalodon shark teeth and other ious fossils.” After the discovery last week, Michael said he was in awe of the huge fossil. I canapost take my eyes off of it, he said. Megalodons were previously classied as part of the Lamnidae family, which would have meant that they were closely related to great white sharks . However, they are now listed as part of the Otodontidae family, which is extinct. Megalodons are often considered to have been one of the biggest predators on the planet. Michael said his job means he is in the water with the customers a lot. “You can hear them underwater when they find a tooth,” he said. “You can hear them yell... It just makes you feel good.

Meghan said she was writing the letter to House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Charles Schumer “as a mom” and “on behalf of millions of American families”. The duchess, who is mother to UK-born Archie and US-born Lilibet, said paid leave should be “a national right” as she reflected on how hard her parents worked and how she herself started working at the age of .  Meghan reflected on her family le after the birth of Lilibet earlier this year, saying: “In June, my husband and I welcomed our second child. “Like any parents, we were overjoyed. Like many parents, we were overwhelmed. “Like fewer parents, we weren’t confronted with the harsh reality of either spending those first few critical months with our baby or going back to work. “We knew we could take her home, and in that vitalstage, devote any and everything to our kids and to our family. “We knew that by doing so we wouldn’t have to make impossible choices about childcare, work, and medical care that so many have to make every single day. “No family should be faced with these decisions. No family should have to choose between earning a living and having the freedom to take care of their child .”The US has no system for paid parental leave, although President Joe Biden has vowed to introduce it.The American-born royal also revealed some of the dficulties she faced growing up and as an adult living in Calornia. She wrote: “I grew up on the .-dollar salad bar at Sizzler – it may have cost less back then– but what I do remember was the feeling: I knew how hard my parents worked to afford this because even at five bucks, eating out was something special, and I felt lucky.  “And as a Girl Scout, when my troop would go to dinner for a big celebration, it was back to that same salad bar or The Old Spaghetti Factory because that’s what those families could afford to do too. “I started workingat the age of . “I waited tables, babysat, and piece-mealed jobs together to cover odds and ends. “I worked all my le and saved when and where I could – but even that was a luxury – because usually it was about making ends meet and having enough to pay my rent and put gas in my car.” The former Suits actress, who signed off as “Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex”, concluded the letter, by writing: “If we’re going to create a new era of family-first policies, let’s make sure that includes a strong paid leave program for every American that’s guaranteed, accessible, and encouraged without stigma or penalty.  “I know how politically charged things can – and have – become. But this isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong. “This is about putting families above politics. And for a refreshing change, it’s something we all seem to agree on. At a point when everything feels so isive, let this be a shared goal that unites us. “So, on behalf of my family, Archie and Lili and Harry, I thank you for considering this letter, and on behalf of all families, I ask you to ensure this consequential moment is not lost.” The Sussexes have established a new le for themselves in the celebrity enclave of Montecito in Calornia, buying a multimillion-pound home and launching a non-profit foundation.Harry and Meghan have also signed lucrative deals – thought to be worth well over £ million – with Spoty and Netflix that have given them the capital to pursue their new lestyle and public goals.Comment MORE ON Meghan Markle\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dog owner Shannyfantg was rewatching security footage of her dogs when she saw what she believes is a aposghostapos.She shared the clip on her account @user, and urged viewers to watch the black dog carefully.She wrote: Sorry for the obnoxious barking at the beginning. Watch my black dog. Ghost takes her collar off in her crate. In the video, her two dogs, both in separate crates, are barking at each other. They continue to do this non-stop, until about  seconds into the footage, when the animals fall completely quiet - and stand alert for some time. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The black dog, which is in the cage on the right, starts whimpering and suddenly rears back into the cage as far as it can, when its collar randomly falls off. This is what convinced its owner that there was a aposghostapos - and sheaposs not the only one that thinks it. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than one million likes and thousands of comments from people who say itaposs a ghost too. One person said: Iaposve never seen such a convincing ghost video.  Another wrote: They both got super quiet... they felt the energy. A third commented: The silence was unsettling. Someone  put: Something that messes with the dogs doesnapost sit right with me. Others suggested that the collar got caught on one of the bars of the metal crate, causing it to come loose. They said: Collar was stuck on crate, when the dog turns his head it unbuckled. The dog got startled at the collar unbuckling and jumped back. Cmon people. The only thing that would make sense - BESIDES A GHOSTis the collar was too tight, the dog turned its neck and made it snap off. Dog gets scared and jumps back. But not everyone was convinced as the dog was aposnowhere near the sides of that crate for it to be stuck on anythingapos.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Police in New Zealand jumped into action and having headed to his home an officer was able to confirm that he did in fact have cool toys. The recording of the call was shared on social media by police in the South Island city of Invercargill. While they do not encourage children to ring the emergency number, officers alleged the call was “too cute not to share”. The call begins in standard fashion, with the emergency operator saying: “This is police, where is the emergency ” After a pause the unidentied boy hesitantly says: “Hi”, and then “police lady ” The dispatcher responds in a softer tone: Yes. “What’s going on ”  “Um, can I tell you something ” the boy asks, before adding: “I’ve got some toys for you.” The woman then said: “You’ve got some toys for me  And he replied: “Yep. Come over and see them!” A man then picks up the phone from the boy and confirms the call was a mistake and there was, in fact, no emergency. Still, a police dispatch call then goes out, providing the address and stating clearly: “There is a four-year-old there who is wanting to show police their toys, over.” An officer pounces into action, saying: “Yeah I’m one up, I’ll attend to.” Police said the officer, identied only as Constable Kurt, attended the address, whereupon he was shown a selection of toys. He later confirmed to his fellow officers that, as he had testied, the boy did indeed “have cool toys”. The force also shared a photo of Constable Kurt with the boy sitting happily on the bonnet of his police car and wearing the officer’s hat, saying the lad had even ben treated to seeing its flashing lights in operation.

Along with the traditional orange pumpkins, you may also spot people out and about with teal or blue ones too.The blue pumpkin buckets are being used by trick or treaters to show households they have autism, Manchester Evening News reports. The idea was started by a mother in America who explained her decision in a Facebook post which has been shared thousands of times.She wrote: If you see someone who appears to be an adult dressed up to trick or treat this year carrying this blue bucket, he’s our son! His name is BJ  he is autistic. “While he has the body of a  year old, he loves Halloween.  Please help us keep his spirit alive  happy. So when you see the blue bucket share a piece of candy. Spread awareness! These precious people are not “too big” to trick or treat. “Love this idea! Hope he has a great Halloween,” one person commented. Another said: “I will be ready and waiting for BJ.” According to the NHS website, people with autism frequently have issues with social interaction and communication. By making it clear to others that a trick or treater is autistic, the hope is that households are receptive to a slightly dferent kind of interaction. Teal pumpkins may also be seen due to another campaign which also started in America in . The Teal Pumpkin Project is an awareness campaign from Food Allergy Research and Educationwhich aims to make sure children with food allergies or other dietary restrictions can also enjoy trick or treating. According to the FARE website, a teal pumpkin placed on a doorstep symbolises safety, inclusion and respect of iniduals managing food allergies.

Covid pandemic has had on the four million people asked to shield across the UK.Experts from Aberdeen University and NHS Grampian were part of the Health Foundation#s Networked Data Labteam who analysed the effect shielding had on inidual#s health outcomes.The team discovered #signicant unmet health needs# and worsening mental health among those classed as clinically extremely vulnerable.Data showed the rate of deaths among this group was more than two and a half times that of the general population at the peak of the first wave in April , with  in , dying compared to one in , of the general population.By the end of August , this group accounted for % of all deaths # while only making up % of the population in England.The Health Foundation is calling for urgent action to be taken by those planning pandemic recovery with priority for the clinically extremely vulnerable to prevent further deterioration, based on the research findings.The Aberdeen leg of the project was led by Dr Jess Butler who said identying the clinically extremely vulnerable through their records was #challenging#.The research suggests there were #signicant issues# in the way that the shielding list was compiled with iations across the country and dfering qualities of data available.This raised questions around how effectively vulnerable people were identied andthey had access to the support they needed throughout the pandemic, including food parcels, priority delivery slots for online shopping and medicine delivery.She continued: #Clinicians in Grampian, across the acute sector and primary care, worked hard to identy those who were at risk and add them to the shielding list.#This accounted for almost half of all people asked to shield and took a considerable amount of work. While this approach helped rapidly identy some iniduals, there are limitations to an algorithm-driven approach.#Greater access to data from general practice and better data sharing would improve identication. Investment in data sharing and data quality monitoring will be essential to improving the process.#This is needed to provide the NHS with an accurate picture of the clinically extremely vulnerable population so that services can be designed and delivered to meet their needs.#Better data is also needed so that in the event of future emergencies we can more effectively identy those at the highest risk of poor outcomes.#Kathryn Marszalek, senior analytical manager at the Health Foundation, highlighted that shielding has also had an impact on people#s mental health.She explained: #Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable are, by definition, a high-risk group and the government took rapid steps to ensure that they would be protected during the pandemic.#Despite this, they have seen worse rates of infection and death from Covid- and, having greater health care needs, have been particularly impacted by changes to NHS services during the pandemic.#However, the negative impact goes beyond the harm to their physical health. Over a period of  months, those advised to isolate at home have been unable to take part in usual activities, such as shopping for food, exercising, or seeing friends and family.#Our research reveals the toll this has taken on the mental wellbeing of many clinically extremely vulnerable people who were already more likely to suffer from mental health conditions than the general population.#Action is now needed by those planning the recovery at local and national levels to address the unmet need for NHS care and worsening mental health.#Further investment is urgently needed to ensure that in the event of a future health emergency, we can quickly, accurately and consistently identy iniduals to enable rapid planning and delivery of relevant support.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

students with a spate of flashing incidents just weeks after their arrival in Aberdeen.The students have been left distressed by the behaviour they are being exposed to at Seaton Park, just beside the Hillhead halls of residence.Details of the incidents emerged during a meeting of Old Aberdeen Community Council last night.One teenager reported the concerns, pleading with the community group to fight for action.He said: #There are problems regarding people flashing in Seaton Park, and numerous students are feeling unsafe.#These are first year students coming here for the first time, and I think something needs to be done about that.#It#s a big concern.#The majority of the incidents are thought to have taken place #later in the evening#.But with winter drawing in, the park will frequently be dark as students head home from afternoon lectures.Caretaker chairman of the community council, David Craik, said problems at the park stretch back decades.He added: #It can be a dangerous place, it has been an issue for so many years.#Member Lekky Shepherd suggested the university should issue guidance on #the safest ways to go back and forth from halls#.She added that there is very little time dference between walking around Seaton Park, along Don Street, compared to cutting through it.And Lekky questioned whether more lighting, and CCTV cameras at the gates, could act as a deterrent.David suggested perpetrators could be put offthey #knew they were being pictured on the way in and out#.A police spokeswoman said complaints regarding indecent exposure are #taken very seriously#.She added: #We appreciate the adverse affect this type of behaviour can have on anyone who witnesses it.#People should call they have any information on the recent lewd acts, or ring #immediately#they want to report an ongoing incident.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “We have always advised the public not to use the park in the dark and this approach has always been backed by the police.#There are well-lit routes around the park which should be used. We will continue to liaise with police colleagues to seeadditional measures are required.#Nick Edwards, head of student support at the university, said: “We would encourage students – and indeed the general public – to avoid accessing the park in the dark and instead make use of the lit walkways around King Street and Don Street.“Alongside Police Scotland, we continue to raise awareness to our student body of the dangers of walking through the park at night, and reinforce messages throughout the year, and during orientation, about personal safety.“We encourage all students to make use of our free bus service where they can to get to and from Hillhead and campus, and we have our SafeZone app they can download to directly engage with university security or emergency servicesthey feel at risk.#Nick added that reminders about the risks will be issued #throughout the winter and beyond#.Victim Support Scotland says indecent exposure incidents #can lead to anxiety, fear and feelings of distrust and violation#.The charity offers support and information on its free, confidential helpline at   .Its website states: #If you or someone you care about has been affected by an indecent exposure incident, please know that you are not alone.#Whoever you are, whatever the situation and whenever the crime took place, we can help you.#Girls night in: Boycott of Aberdeen nightclubs

urged to do more to help homeowners pay for energy efficiency upgrades to their homes, with figures showing more than , homes across the north and north-east fall below the target.Earlier this month, the SNP and Green coalition published their strategy for making homes across Scotland cleaner and greener from .The plan will require more than a million homes and the equivalent of , non-domestic buildings to meet at least an Energy Performance Certicaterating of C standard by .Figures from the Scottish House Condition Survey reveals Shetland has the highest percentage of homes with an EPC rating of less than C in Scotland.The most recent data, from  to , shows three quarter of homes in the Highlands fall below the standard and more than half of domestic properties in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire are also below the target.Scottish Conservative MSP Alexander Burnett, who represents Aberdeenshire West, has called on ministers to #stand up and help homeowners across the north-east#.Homes currently account for around a fth of Scotland#s emissions and will need to be made more energy efficient with the majority switching to low or zero carbon heating systems to meet the SNP-Green target of becoming a net zero nation by .Mr Burnett said: #The SNP have not outlined what funding is going to be in place to support owners and private landlords to achieve environmental targets.#These costs have the potential to alarmingly spiral into millions for the north-east.#It’s clear the coalition of chaos is ill-prepared to deliver on the need, which we all accept, to decarbonise millions of homes across Scotland over the next decade.#The SNP-Green Government must be upfront about their plans otherwise it is hardworking people who are going to pay the pricewe don’t have a fair transition to net zero.#Speaking in Holyrood earlier this month, Patrick Harvie, zero carbon buildings minister, said there will be certain trigger points for buildings to meet EPC band C standards after the regulations are set out in .This could include a change of tenancy when a property is empty, a point of sale, when major refurbishment is carried out or when replacement or installation of a new heating system takes place.The Scottish Government is investing at least £. billion over the course of this parliament in heat and energy supplies across Scotland but has made it clear #that the cost cannot be borne by government alone#.Mr Harvie told MSPs it is expected the total cost of ending Scotland#s contribution to climate change from buildings emissions will be more than £ billion.A spokesman for the Scottish Government called on the UK Government to take #urgent action# in reserved areas to support the just transition to decarbonised heating, adding that Westminster#s current overall plan does not go far or fast enough#.He added: #The ambition set out in our Heat in Buildings Strategy is signicant, and rightly so on the eve of COP coming to Glasgow.“This is a huge transition, affecting communities, businesses and households all across Scotland and we must work collaboratively – across public and private sectors, across parliament, and across governments, to deliver it.#We are clear that, as we take these bold steps to reduce emissions from our homes and buildings, we must do so in a way that leaves no-one behind.#The Scottish Government already offers a comprehensive support package for domestic and small scale non-domestic heat and energy efficiency measures through our Home Energy Scotland and Energy Efficiency Business Support services.#Our existing funding scheme for zero emission heating systems, including heat pumps, already goes beyond the support offered by the UK Government#s Clean Heat Grant, with grant funding of up to £, per household, in addition to a further £, of grant for energy efficiency improvements, as part of the Home Energy Scotland Loan.#A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial said: #The Scottish Government made the decision to opt out of the forthcoming £ million UK Government Boiler Upgrade Scheme.#Decarbonising our buildings is a joint endeavour across the United Kingdom and our Heat and Buildings Strategy showcases our plans to incentivise people to install low-carbon heating systems in a simple, fair and cheap way as they replace their old boilers

The chairman is not a single guy who picks the manager at this football club. I don#t think that#s ever going to be the case.#There#s a group of people on the board who picked the previous manager and stuck by him and did very well for the club. Now they#ve chosen to put me in.#It#s insulting to a lot of people and to be honest, there#s a clear agenda. I understand it, I accept it and I#ll try to prove the people right who believe in me.#The Dons boss stopped short of going into detail on what that agenda is, but it is clear he believes it is his turn to be in the firing line, with the radio interview with Cormack in particular highlighting what he believes is a drive to push him out of the club.He said: “His personality is to stand up for the club and the whole club feels the benefit of having a chairman like that. He showed that the other night.“I listened to the show. I don#t listen to anything , but I knew he was going to be on it.“It sounded very much like they were pushing the chairman towards saying he should be sacking me.“But he held strong to his belief that we are the right group of people to lead the club and the players are capable of getting ourselves out of the hole that we#re in at the moment.“It was a bit surreal really. Listening to a radio show where basically the guys are trying to provoke the chairman by saying we think you should sack your manager.“A little bit surreal. But you#re Aberdeen manager, you are not getting the results. I know it goes with the territory and I accept it.#The support is appreciated. I hope to repay it. Only we can change the results and only we can change people’s ability to question us like that.”When askedhe believes the agenda is from the media, Glass said: “No, the media is a big group of people.“I know there are a lot of right-minded people in the media and there are a lot of people who are shock jocksyou like, and their job is to provoke and make noise.“If it is not me it will be another manager. It is pretty evident there are people out there and that’s their job.”Glass’ former Dons team-mate Peter Hetherston is among those to criticise Glass’ appointment, claiming the Dons boss is not ruthless enough for the job and is too nice.The Aberdeen manager, not one for paying much heed to articles, has taken note of Hetherston’s remarks.He said: “Someone sent me that article last night. It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest and it doesn’t surprise because of who wrote it.“But it goes with the territory. You lose games and you open yourself up to criticism.“There is a personal insult in there from someone I’ve not spoken to for  years.#He must be a hell of a good judge of characterhe can judge me from distance, not having spoken to me for  years.

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers.

the reportsrsquo authors strongly resisted political pressure.Documents, leaked to Unearthed, Greenpeacersquos team of investigative journalists, names countries including Australia and Saudi Arabia as those trying to get the IPCC to weaken a conclusion that fossil fuels should be phased out.Brazil and Argentina have also reportedly made comments pressing IPCC report authors to delete messages about the climate benefits of undertaking a ldquoplant-based diet, despite a study in  finding that moving to a meat-free diet could cut food land use, and reduce emissions by %.And the Australian

part of the cycle that IPCC climate science assessments go through.The final draft of each report is published after it has been approved unanimously line-by-line in sessions between government representatives and scientists.The leaked documents include more than , submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties, on the draft report of the IPCCrsquos working group III section of the UN bodyrsquos sixth assessment of climate science.The working group III report, due to be published next year, is responsible for assessing responses and solutions to climate change, by reducing emissions and enhancing ldquocarbon sinks such as forests.Unearthed reports that the majority of contributions were ldquoconstructive comments aimed at improving the report.A spokesman for the IPCC said processes used when drafting reports were ldquodesigned to guard against lobbying from all quarters.And UK scientists involved in the process rejected the idea they would be swayed by political lobbying.Prof Piers Forster, professor of climate change and Priestley Centre director, University of Leeds, said: ldquoIn my over  yearsrsquo experience of writing IPCC reports there has always been lobbying from multiple directions.ldquoIt is important to note that the authors get the last word as ultimately the report rests on peer reviewed science, not opinion.He said governments eventually agree the text unanimously, making it the trusted source of climate science for all countries.ldquoThis would not be possible unless all countries felt free to air their views and have them respected, listened to and responded to by the authors.Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: ldquoIPCC reports are scientic documents and the authors respond to review comments on the basis of their scientic merit.ldquoItrsquos important that government representatives can comment on the science, and very often they make valid, useful

change are expected.In the summer, the IPCC published the first part of its sixth assessment ndash after approval by governments ndash which issued a stark warning on how people were driving dangerous

fuels and unsustainable meat production, they are using every opportunity to protect their corporate interests and continue with business as usual while the planet burns.ldquoAs the global spotlight

transmissible that the original Covid iants discovered in .However, with tests currently underway, there is so far no indication that it is signicantly more transmissible, and experts are keen to acknowledge that virus mutation is very common and not necessarily reason for concern.With this in mind, heres what we know about the so-called Delta plus iant...What is Delta plus AY.., or Delta plus, has been described as a \"descendant of Delta\" and was discovered by scientists in July , shortly after Delta became the predominant iant in the UK.While the new iants presence is increasing in the UK, it is not rising as fast as the original Delta earlier this year.Experts are monitoring the iant, however ithas notbeen deemed a\"iant under investigation\" or a \"iant of concern\".Delta plus has mutations which impact the spike protein, which viruses use to attack the bodys cells.If examination finds that this iant is likely to be more infectious than the original Delta, it will be promoted to a \"iant under investigation\".More tests will then be done to determine whether it should become a \"iant of concern\".The good newsis that currently experts do not believe that Delta plus will take hold, meaning it could drop off the watch list soon.What do experts say about Delta plus Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College Londons Genetics Institute, said \"dont panic\" regarding the new iant, which is \"nothing\" like the situation with Alpha or Delta.\"Its nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like  to  percent more transmissible. So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.\"It is likely to be up to  percent more transmissible.\"Its good that we are aware. Its excellent that we have the facilities and infrastructure in place to see anything that might be a bit suspicious.\"At this stageI would say wait and see, dont panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.\"What have Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson said about Delta plus In a tweet

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

I have referred to this excellent record in providing information for this historical résumé.A further detailed company history is being prepared, though the rapidity with which West Coast#s evolution takes place means that it is hard to ever regard any such work as complete!Suffice it to say that John, David and William Craig, having formed a garage repair business just after the end of the First World War, then ventured into the realms of road passenger transport in February  by launching a service between Campbeltown and Tarbert to compete with Duncan Ramsay, an existing operator on this route.The Post Office then put out to tender its mail contract to meet the steamer at Tarbert. It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow. This was renewed at succeeding intervals and continued right up until .The vans and light trucks later used were every bit as smartly turned out as the coaches, and were an excellent advert for the company.To be continued in next week#s Courier."},{"url":null,"title":"whats on at campbeltown picture house","story":"Ron’s Gone Wrong is the story of Barney, a socially awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally-connected device, which is supposed to be his ‘Best Friend out of the Box.’ Ron’s hilarious mals set against the backdrop of the social media age, launch them into an action-packed journey in which boy and robot come to terms with the wonderful messiness of true friendship.Previews From ThursdayDirected by Denis Villeneuve Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people.

The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-cricketers-play-icc-mens-t20-world-cup-kit-designed-haddington-schoolgirl","story":"The ICC Menrsquos T World Cup gets under way in the United Arab Emirates and Oman this weekend.Scotland, who start their tournament against Bangladesh this Sunday, will be wearing a design created by Haddingtonrsquos Rebecca Downie.The youngsterrsquos pattern was chosen from more than  entries from schoolchildren across Scotland.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Robert Leslie, THAW Orkney manager, said:#We are extremely grateful for this funding from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. We experienced high demand during the pandemic from Orkney residents with mental health issues or learning dficulties as they sought support to engage with energy efficiency programmes, energy providers, and income maximisation and debt services. It became clear, due to the volume of referrals and complexity of some of the work, that this was an area of our activity that needed to expand or we would be overwhelmed.#This contribution from the Resilient Communities Fund will add resource to this vital work at a time we expect demand to grow considerably again, with rising electricity prices and reductions in other support mechanisms that have been in place during the pandemic. THAW Orkney will need to be at full strength to meet this demand, and this award takes us a step closer.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

part of the cycle that IPCC climate science assessments go through.The final draft of each report is published after it has been approved unanimously line-by-line in sessions between government representatives and scientists.The leaked documents include more than , submissions made by governments, companies and other interested parties, on the draft report of the IPCCrsquos working group III section of the UN bodyrsquos sixth assessment of climate science.The working group III report, due to be published next year, is responsible for assessing responses and solutions to climate change, by reducing emissions and enhancing ldquocarbon sinks such as forests.Unearthed reports that the majority of contributions were ldquoconstructive comments aimed at improving the report.A spokesman for the IPCC said processes used when drafting reports were ldquodesigned to guard against lobbying from all quarters.And UK scientists involved in the process rejected the idea they would be swayed by political lobbying.Prof Piers Forster, professor of climate change and Priestley Centre director, University of Leeds, said: ldquoIn my over  yearsrsquo experience of writing IPCC reports there has always been lobbying from multiple directions.ldquoIt is important to note that the authors get the last word as ultimately the report rests on peer reviewed science, not opinion.He said governments eventually agree the text unanimously, making it the trusted source of climate science for all countries.ldquoThis would not be possible unless all countries felt free to air their views and have them respected, listened to and responded to by the authors.Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: ldquoIPCC reports are scientic documents and the authors respond to review comments on the basis of their scientic merit.ldquoItrsquos important that government representatives can comment on the science, and very often they make valid, useful suggestions based on their own knowledge of the literature, but IPCC authors are keenly alert to the possibility of political pressure and strongly resist it.The leaks come ahead of the Cop conference, where countries face calls to increase action to cut emissions and prevent global warming of more than .C of above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the most dangerous impacts of climate change are expected.In the summer, the IPCC published the first part of its sixth assessment ndash after approval by governments ndash which issued a stark warning on how people were driving dangerous climate change.The report was labelled a ldquocode red for humanity.Commenting on the leaked documents, Greenpeace International executive director Jenner Morgan, said: ldquoThis is an insight into how a small group of coal, oil and meat producing countries continue to put the profits of a few polluting industries before science and our planetrsquos future.ldquoRather than phasing out fossil fuels and unsustainable meat production, they are using every opportunity to protect their corporate interests and continue with business as usual while the planet burns.ldquoAs the global spotlight moves to Glasgow, other world leaders should be aware of how far these governments will go to sabotage our chances of keeping .C in sight.ldquoThe key test for world leaders is whether or not they agree to rapidly phase out fossil fuels, as the science warrants.ldquoHistory will not be kind to themthey fail ndash and we will be watching, she warned.We want our comments to be a lively and

Currently,  of the current constituencies fall outside this range.As the existing constituencies were established in , but the current local government boundaries are more recent, from , these wards have been used as ‘building blocks’ by the Commission in setting out the changes.The full list of the proposed changes can be found on the Boundary Commission website.Professor Tonge said: “The previous threat of cutting a parliamentary seat from Northern Ireland is clearly over.“A radical change would have cut the Belfast seats, but that would have caused uproar. You could argue it’s the local government tail wagging the parliamentary constituency dog, as it is very focused on placing as many wards as possible within single constituencies to avoid splitting — understandable I suppose, but I doubt the electorate really cares that much.“A very early reading is that Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein the renamed Belfast South becomes a shade more unionist, but not enough to give the SDLP’s Claire Hanna sleepless nights Foyle becomes a bit more nationalist and East Londonderry a bit more unionist. If there is a pattern overall, it’s a very marginal deepening of the green and orange areas — nationalist areas consolidated in particular, but some unionist seats as well.”Deputy chairman of the Commission, Mr Justice Michael Humphreys, said: “The Commission is keen to encourage everyone with an interest to share their views by engaging with the consultation process, whether it is to support the proposals or to suggest alternatives which also take into account the requirements of the legislation.”The proposals will now go out for consultation and public hearing before final recommendations are made by July , .Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyMost ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’Alban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobTop VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern IrelandWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressDUP block on welfare mitigation legislation ‘disgraceful’, says HargeyNI centenary: Boris Johnson and Simon Coveney in Armagh for cross-community service of reflection and hopeAndrew Clarke tipped for big future at Linfield as David Healy says striker has ‘more brains than a rocket scientist’Drug dealer Noel Johnston may have mistook police for hit squad prior to fatal fallLatestWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressArteta says ‘anything is possible’ as he discusses Lacazette’s Arsenal futureDUP block on welfare mitigation legislation ‘disgraceful’, says HargeyWelsh NHS boss warns of ‘hard period ahead’ as winter loomsNI centenary: Boris Johnson and Simon Coveney in Armagh for cross-community service of reflection and hope,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

ExpandChristopher LeebodyTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThose gathered at an event to mark the centenary of partition and the creation of Northern Ireland has heard how the past has shaped society, ided and left scars, but also helped bring people together. The Service of Reflection and Hope in Armagh began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen, who was unable to attend.Welcoming the congregation to the service, he said: Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us. And, yet, it has also on occasion brought us together.As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is in attendance at the service, along with Northern Ireland#s First Minister Paul Givan. The Irish Government has sent two representatives, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Chief Whip Jack Chambers. And PM Boris Johnson is in attendance. The service became the centre of a row last month after the president of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, declined an invitation to attend because he believed it was not politically neutral.Sinn Fein is not attending the event while the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is attending representing his party.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church service []jsdjs.src\"embed.scribblelive widgets embed.js\"ijsMost ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top job‘Tiocfaidh ar la’: Nigel Farage ‘happy to say anything for £’Top VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern IrelandJohnson and Coveney attend church service to mark centenary of Northern IrelandWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressDUP block on welfare mitigation legislation ‘disgraceful’, says HargeyAndrew Clarke tipped for big future at Linfield as David Healy says striker has ‘more brains than a rocket scientist’Drug dealer Noel Johnston may have mistook police for hit squad prior to fatal fallLatestCarl FramptonOpinionTyson Fury is the best heavyweight boxer of his era… he’s better than Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder by a country mileJulian TaylorOpinionRangers can revive their Europa League campaign but a win over Brondby is more important to Steven Davis than mostTory MPs voice concerns over face mask ‘obsession’ amid booster rollout fearsJohnson and Coveney attend church service to mark centenary of Northern IrelandCrackdown on buy now pay later sector looms as consultation is launched,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is absolutely crucial people support those businesses as that is what the voucher is all about.”Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster added: “Look, we all have to accept there are people maybe less fortunate than you and I, that this £ puts food in their cupboard.“But I think there is a huge dference between someone going and buying groceries in one of our supermarkets to feed their kids and using it for an Amazon voucher.“I think at this point we should be appealing to them [the supermarkets] and they should come out and make a statement and say they should no longer accept [the card] for that type of purchase.”During the show a number of callers admitted they would be using the Spend Local card to purchase vouchers for the online retail giant.One man called Graham told the show: “When I get my money, I am going to nip down and buy a voucher and I am going to spend it on Amazon.I am going to buy on Amazon something I can get for maybe half the price I can buy through my local retailer.”While the cards cannot be used online or for gambling or legal services like penalties, according to the Department for the Economy there is no technical way to prevent online gt vouchers being purchased in a store.They said the “limits of the technology” mean it is “not possible to distinguish between items within someone’s shopping basket”.In a statement from a department spokesperson, they instead encouraged the public to think of the local retailers who have been impacted by the pandemic and said an advertising campaign is designed to encourage this.“The High Street Scheme is designed to stimulate demand in local businesses, including retail and hospitality sectors, following the pandemic,” they said.“However, the scheme has also been designed to be as simple to use as possible in order to allow the public to spend their £ pre-paid card in local businesses.“It was set up so that businesses in Northern Ireland that can accept a debit or credit card as payment for goods or services they sell, can also accept the Spend Local cards as payment.“While it is possible to purchase some goods which will have less benefit to our local businesses, the Department would discourage this.”They added: “Indeed, the Department has been clear in its messaging to all card holders – use your Spend Local card to help those retail, hospitality and other sectors in your local area that have been most impacted by the pandemic.“This message has been embraced by many of our local business owners who are encouraging card holders to spend a little to give a big effect. We encourage Nolan Show listeners to do the same.”Most ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’Alban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobTop VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern IrelandWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressDUP block on welfare mitigation legislation ‘disgraceful’, says HargeyNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldAndrew Clarke tipped for big future at Linfield as David Healy says striker has ‘more brains than a rocket scientist’Drug dealer Noel Johnston may have mistook police for hit squad prior to fatal fallLatestIndian PM Modi to attend Cop climate conference in GlasgowHundreds more evacuated as volcano lava moves further into La Palma townWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressIceland to give away food on last day of shelf le to online customers freeEvanna Lynch criticises radio DJ who called Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay ‘chubby’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one wants ato the draconian measures that have been in place for so long.The Executive has identied a robust and dynamic communication strategy as key in achieving this. Time will tellit can stay on message.Most ReadBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church servicePolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’Alban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobTop VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern IrelandWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressDUP block on welfare mitigation legislation ‘disgraceful’, says HargeyNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldAndrew Clarke tipped for big future at Linfield as David Healy says striker has ‘more brains than a rocket scientist’Drug dealer Noel Johnston may have mistook police for hit squad prior to fatal fallLatestWelfare mitigation: Hargey has raised issue with NI Executive  times and written  letters but still no progressEvanna Lynch criticises radio DJ who called Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay ‘chubby’Arteta says ‘anything is possible’ as he discusses Lacazette’s Arsenal futureDUP block on welfare mitigation legislation ‘disgraceful’, says HargeyWelsh NHS boss warns of ‘hard period ahead’ as winter looms,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Claudy para-triathletes Chloe and Judith MacCombe have put themselves in pole position for a place in the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games after claiming first and second place at the national championships in Limerick. Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings. He continued: The efforts that have been made by so many in recent months to drive up vaccination rates and step-up compliance with mitigations do seem to be working. It is vital that we dont let up. We must maintain our focus and collective endeavour.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry twins take on marathons on same day in dferent cities overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaCarraig Foam Party. . .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry twins take on marathons on same day in dferent cities overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaCarraig Foam Party. . .

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry twins take on marathons on same day in dferent cities overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaCarraig Foam Party. . .

Castlerock footbridge is the subject of a ,-year lease to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, entered into by the legacy Coleraine Borough Council in . googletag.cmd.push The bridge was removed in  to assess whether or not it could be restored and to investigate costs for any work required. Councillors recently raised concerns that the bridge was now sitting exposed to the elements, with Cllr Adrian McQuillan previously describing it as a big rusty mess. Now a report to the Environmental Services Committee has revealed further analysis on the bridge will take between  and  weeks. “Mann Williams Consultants have issued costs to complete the additional analysis necessary to satisfy the requirements of Translink and Council that the bridge is safe to re-install,” said the report.     “This work will commence shortly and is estimated to take - weeks. Council and Translink have agreed to meet monthly to keep abreast of progress.” An exasperated Cllr Richard Holmes asked a council officialTranslink would ever be satisfied the bridge could be safely re-installed. “The report is  or  weeks away, which seems an awful long time given how long weve already sat doing inspections on this,” said the UUP representative. “There is a chance that Translink are going to throw up obstacle after obstacle and we could be sitting here in ten years time with just a few elements of rust being left. “The bridge stood there for years, and local engineering firms took it out, fixed it and left it back previously. We didnt have to go through this amount of work. “Is it a case that no matter how many reports we do, somebody at Translink is quite happy for this bridge never to be put back in place ” Council official Aidan McPeake said there were design standards that had to be met. “Translink must be satisfied the bridge meets them,” he said. “Having done the initial analysis, it doesnt meet that, so were having to do these further finite element analysis on it. “If after this, it still doesnt pass, Translink wont let it back in. Thats the bottom line.” “It could be in Garvagh museum yet,” responded Cllr Holmes.  pound, spent allowing County Derry footbridge to become a big rusty mess  Cllr Adrian McQuillan has vowed to keep the issue on the Council agenda.

Cahore Playing Fields in Draperstown is currently home to Draperstown Celtic Football Club, who requested that Mid Ulster District Council upgrade the facilities back in February . googletag.cmd.push The proposal was approved at last weeks Development Committee, with plans to move forward with a sub-leasing arrangement also given the go-ahead. Local company Heron Bros currently lease the land directly to the Council, with the lease ied in  to a term of  years, backdated to April  . After public expressions of interest were sought in September, submissions for the two soccer pitches and one GAA pitch were received from Draperstown Celtic FC and St Colms GAC Ballinascreen. A site map of the location in Draperstown showing the pitches. Both clubs have indicated acceptance of LPS rent valuations for the site, with the soccer pitches to be rented at pound, per year and the GAA pitch at pound, per year.     Council will retain control of the sites pavilion under the arrangement due to the muli-sport nature of the facility, with clubs paying pound each in a keyholding arrangement. An initial survey carried out by a local contractor has indicated a cost of around pound, to upgrade the facilities, with the GAA pitch and one soccer pitch experiencing poor drainage. The report indicated the upgrade would focus on the GAA pitch, with the security provided by the lease allowing Draperstown Celtic to apply for funding to develop a G pitch in place of one soccer pitch. Councillor for the area, Catherine Elattar, said improvements at the site were overdue. “This seems to be a sensible approach. Money does need to be spent bringing the pitches up to standard,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “The leasing arrangement will allow the cost of this to be recouped in a relatively short period by Council. “It also allows local clubs to take over responsibility for the pitches, which will benefit the local community, as these clubs do an awful lot of important work in the area. Catherine Elattar spoke in favour of approval. Cllr Water Cuddy said he would not be voting against the proposal, but told the Committee it did seem very complicated. “Ive just cant understand why we dont step out and let the two clubs talk to the landowner,” he said. “Any public organisation needs to have policies in place and follow those through, becausewe start stepping outside policies, it gets very dficult. “We need to keep this as tidy as possible. Can we not just sign this over to the clubs without the spend so they can draw down the funding themselves  “Theyre getting pound, of grant aid through the back door almost. We need to keep things clear and transparent. “Its great to see it being delivered, and Im not against the project, but it just seems so complicated.” Cllr Cuddys UUP colleague, Cllr Trevor Wilson raised questions over how quickly the process had been undertaken. “My concern is that this was brought before us in February and we now have a report sitting [proposing] to go ahead with this,” he said. “I brought a report last year on another sporting facility and it has never reached this table. It makes you wonder. Ill just leave it at that.” Draperstown Celtic will join St Colms GAC Ballinascreen at the facility. Cllr Elattar said she was glad to hear Cllr Cuddy would not vote against the proposal. “These pitches in Cahore are not fit for purpose. If you come up to see them, you could be up to your knees in water,” she said. “The soccer team has to travel sometimes to Dungiven to play matches because they cant actually use the pitches. “The money needs to be spent whether or not the lease goes ahead. The lease gives the clubs ownership and lets them apply for outside funding that will add to what these pitches offer.”  County Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home  The -year-old has been disqualied from driving.

When Ann decided four years ago to take on a new challenge in the form of running, she knew Claire would be her biggest supporter. googletag.cmd.push You see, Claire is no stranger to running, having undertaken almost  marathons to date, including ultras and  hour running events, she was only too happy to share her experience with herolder sister. The twins celebrate their achievements. But that Sunday morning Ann would have to step out in The Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon without Claire by her side.. and it seems Claire was more nervous than Ann about that. Ann, who lives inMagherasaid: “I only started running in  when we lost our youngest sister, Julie. I was , about to turn  later that year. Swatragh playgroup ran a CK and I joined in with that, that led on to me wanting to run more.     “Claire has been the biggest inspiration, she was always giving me words of advice, evenshe didnt realise she was doing it.” So as Ann built up her miles, and their thbirthday approached, the twins planned a trip to celebrate. But this wouldnt be a holiday where they needed flip-flops, the pair of them packed their running shoes and Ann ran her very first half marathon on the morning of their birthday, in sunny Benidorm with proud twin sister Claire by her side. Claire pictured in London. Claire, who is a member of Ballymena Runners said: “We have done lots of firsts together. Anns first k was with me in Ballymena and we did the half marathon at .am on the morning of our birthday – that was an unofficial one, but I was also there when Ann undertook her first official one. That was in Derry, I was her pacer and she was the only person in the group to stay with me the entire way. “I will never forget it, over the Foyle bridge Ann was right on my heels, I was immensely proud that day.” So how come on Sunday, October  the sisters ended up running in dferent places  Claire, a Learning Support Assistant at St Patricks College Ballymena, explained: “I had every intention of running Belfast, I wanted to be there for Anns very first marathon, but I had got through to run London in  and a stress fracture ruled me out, so when I had the chance this time I was so happy to do it, and it honestly didnt disappoint.” Ann, who works in Crawfords in Maghera, said: “At the beginning I had little motivation running solo, so I started doing social runs with other people close to home, as well as track training. I train with Rosemary Hargan but I belong to Termoneeny running Club.” And when Ann decided she was entering the Belfast Marathon, Claire was only too happy to be her training partner. Ann said: “Claire did a good few training runs with me, she gave me lots of advice, but above all was to smile and enjoy every step which is exactly what I did. I wasnt nervous until I saw the starting line, then I got a message from Claire and knew she was thinking of me, it really relaxed me knowing she was rooting for me! With my phone in my pocket, it was like she was with me. “Its never about the times, I just wanted to finish the marathon. I had hit  miles at four hours and looked at my watch, wonderingClaire had finished yet.” Ann pictured after taking on the Belfast Marathon. Claire added: “I probably overloaded Ann with advice, but she is so laidback I worried she hadnt realised the mammoth task involved in training for a marathon. “Ann and I both have our set days for training and we dont sway too much from them, but we never ever miss the long runs. “We did a good few of them together, Id either go toMagheraor Ann would drive to Cloughmills, wed run  –  miles, but when we didnt run together Ann would tell me what she was doing and Id be messaging her to see how she got on. “On the morning of the marathon I messaged her from the start line, I genuinely couldnt feel any more proud. I was more worried about Ann than myself, I worried that shed get caught up in the crowds and have a struggle to finish. “When I crossed the line myself I phoned my husband, Damien, and he was in Belfast waiting on Ann coming in. I was so happy to know she had the support of him and her whole family, she knew I was there in spirit.” Ann concluded: “I felt so happy running myself and knowing Claire was fulfilling one of her dreams to run in the London marathon. “We have enjoyed so many runs together and I know we will enjoy many more – another marathon is definitely on the cards for me, so hopefully we can both be in the same place for it!” So what advice do the girls give to any budding runners  Or anyone that may think theyre too old to start running  Ann said: “I was nearly  when I started running, Id say do it for YOU, keep turning up, commit to your own training, dont compare yourself to another runner, everyone runs for dferent reasons – headspace, beating their own personal times, but my advice is to show up and do it for you.” Claire, who is also a Leader in Running Fitness at Ballymena Runners, added: “The best advice Id give anyone is to trust your training. The longer runs make you stronger as they build a resilience youll need in a marathon. Consistency is key, as is good nutrition, thats fuel for your body.” So as the two sisters recover and plan their next long run they both want to thank friends who offered support and encouragment to them both during their training, their running clubs and their families, who are all very proud of them both and think theyre an inspiration.

The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award-winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. googletag.cmd.push Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us in order to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September.     “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival.

Sinn Feacuteins Cllr Sean Bateson used a discussion on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Grant Funding Policy Review to raise a question on the funding of a NI centenary event held at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push The event, part-funded by the Council, featured a historical re-enactment of a B-Specials drill demonstration and checkpoint, described by a local SDLP MLA as isive and crass. The organising committee of the event issued a statement to say no Council funding had been used to fund the demonstration. Cllr Sean Bateson Cllr Bateson asked officials at the Leisure and Development Committee to clary no public money had been spent on it. “I would like to speak on . on item  and specically, the NI small grants fund,” said the representative for Bann. “Can I ask the director for clarity on the awarding of this grant and in relation to the grossly inappropriate and deeply insensitive event at Coleraine Town Hall at the weekend      “My community was disgusted at this event and the re-enactment featuring a military display of the B-Specials. “The history of the B-Specials speaks for itself. It was effectively established as the paramilitary wing of the Orange state and was designed to subjugate nationalists and republicans. “For nationalists and republicans, such an event yet again clearly illustrates that the centenary of partition is being used by certain quarters as a show of triumphalism. “Can the director clary and put on recordthis grant went towards the funding and display of this event and the group that was involved in it  “Can the director give me a breakdown of the total Council funding and what it went towards ” Cllr John McAuley Committee Chair, Cllr John McAuley, told Cllr Bateson his question was not related to the agenda item the Grant Funding Policy Review. “You are quite aware that this isnt even part of the agenda,” said the DUP representative. “You did attempt to put in an AORBwhich you were too late for, and now you have decided to try and slip it in to make a few headlines with your republican agenda. “I try not to rise to these sort of things, but its a case of offended by everything and ashamed of nothing. Cllr Bateson began to protest that it was in fact part of the agenda, but Cllr McAuley told him he would chair the meeting as I choose to chair it. “Im the Chair, so Ill speakI want to speak. As a proud son of a B-man, I will not be letting you try and take over this Committee tonight to whitewash history. “Ill chair the meeting as I choose to chair it,” he added. Cllr George Duddy Cllr George Duddy then called a point of order, stating thatCllr Bateson continually interrupted the Chair, the Committee could vote on point of order . that the member not be heard on this item. “When the Chair speaks during the debate, any member speaking at the time must stop and the meeting must be silent,” said the DUP councillor. “Im not sure that Cllr Bateson understands standing orders, but you have asked him on more than one occasion, which is your perogative, to cease speaking, and he has continued to interrupt. “If Cllr Bateson continues, I will call point of order . for a member not to be heard any longer.” “Go ahead Cllr Duddy, I think it shows your agenda,” replied Cllr Bateson. The Committee then voted in favour of the point of order intervention, with nine voting for, two against and three abstentions. It marks the second time in four weeks that a Sinn Feacutein councillor has been subject to point of order . and no longer permitted to speak on an item. Cllr Duddy also called the point of order on Glens councillor Cara McShane at a previous meeting of the Leisure and Development Committee. The incident arose after a fellow DUP councillor claimed Cllr McShane insinuated he was a fool.  MLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry  The demonstration took place on Saturday.

Destined operate centres in Derry and in Feeny, with the latter providing much needed services to more rural north Derry community. googletag.cmd.push Its aim is to build empowerment, address social isolation and exclusion and build lelong skills and self-confidence among its members. Fiona, Michael, Tamara, Peter, Owen, George, Kevin, Ryan and Gavin take a break from their cooking to speak to the County Derry Post last week. Through a iety of activities including karaoke, arts and crafts, cooking and gardening, the members have a busy week. Now, through funding provided by Rank Net Foundation under the Time to Shine project, the group are seeking to establish a new centre in north Derry to match their facility in the city. Some of the members spoke to the County Derry Post, and said more space was needed to complete their activities.     Kevin, Peter and Michael relaxing in the kitchen area of the centre in Feeny. “Its too small and we need more space to do our cooking and karaoke activities, and we havent much space for our computers upstairs,” said Tamara. “We could do with new computers too and maybe another sofa. Id love a nail bar to get some pampering done.” Kevin had his eye on a bigger TV. “We need the new centre because this one is too small. We need a bigger kitchen and a bigger TV,” he said. “If you have a bigger building you can space out more people and have better facilities for both children and adults.” Gavin is keen to show off the groups polytunnel outside the centre. George said everything about Destined was enjoyable, but that more space was the main priority. “I enjoy coming here, I like the people and the staff. Id be looking for more outside space as well. I love it here, but we need more room,” he said. A community survey was carried out earlier this month, with over  people taking part. Project Officer Grainne McNickle said the interest showed clearly an increased demand. “This has been an amazing response from the public,” she said. “The findings from this have strengthened the fact that there is an increasing demand for services in the rural areas to cater for everyone not just those with a Learning Disability. Cooking is just one of the activities the members enjoy at Destined. “Destined have been operating out of a small rented unit in Feeny for nearly ten years now and when the pandemic hit the building was deemed unsuitable for use. “A new centre would benefit Destined members, their family members, and will also be a great asset to people living in the surrounding area.” Alongside a consultation process, the group have worked closely with a steering committee of representatives from the Western Trust, local community groups and Rossmar Special School. The committee has completed a mapping exercise of where best to locate the new centre, and will begin the process of applying to potential funders when this is completed.

Destined operate centres in Derry and in Feeny, with the latter providing much needed services to more rural north Derry community. googletag.cmd.push Its aim is to build empowerment, address social isolation and exclusion and build lelong skills and self-confidence among its members. Fiona, Michael, Tamara, Peter, Owen, George, Kevin, Ryan and Gavin take a break from their cooking to speak to the County Derry Post last week. Through a iety of activities including karaoke, arts and crafts, cooking and gardening, the members have a busy week. Now, through funding provided by Rank Net Foundation under the Time to Shine project, the group are seeking to establish a new centre in north Derry to match their facility in the city. Some of the members spoke to the County Derry Post, and said more space was needed to complete their activities.     Kevin, Peter and Michael relaxing in the kitchen area of the centre in Feeny. “Its too small and we need more space to do our cooking and karaoke activities, and we havent much space for our computers upstairs,” said Tamara. “We could do with new computers too and maybe another sofa. Id love a nail bar to get some pampering done.” Kevin had his eye on a bigger TV. “We need the new centre because this one is too small. We need a bigger kitchen and a bigger TV,” he said. “If you have a bigger building you can space out more people and have better facilities for both children and adults.” Gavin is keen to show off the groups polytunnel outside the centre. George said everything about Destined was enjoyable, but that more space was the main priority. “I enjoy coming here, I like the people and the staff. Id be looking for more outside space as well. I love it here, but we need more room,” he said. A community survey was carried out earlier this month, with over  people taking part. Project Officer Grainne McNickle said the interest showed clearly an increased demand. “This has been an amazing response from the public,” she said. “The findings from this have strengthened the fact that there is an increasing demand for services in the rural areas to cater for everyone not just those with a Learning Disability. Cooking is just one of the activities the members enjoy at Destined. “Destined have been operating out of a small rented unit in Feeny for nearly ten years now and when the pandemic hit the building was deemed unsuitable for use. “A new centre would benefit Destined members, their family members, and will also be a great asset to people living in the surrounding area.” Alongside a consultation process, the group have worked closely with a steering committee of representatives from the Western Trust, local community groups and Rossmar Special School. The committee has completed a mapping exercise of where best to locate the new centre, and will begin the process of applying to potential funders when this is completed.

The proposal will be voted on by members of both branches in the beginning of November.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, A proposal to merge both the Derry and Claudy Credit Unions will be voted on by members at the start of next month. In a letter sent to members of Derrys Credit Union, the branchs President, Sean Hegarty, outlined the proposed merger and his reasons as to why this would benefit both unions googletag.cmd.push Earlier this year, the Directors of the Derry Credit Union were approached by their Claudy counterparts requesting a “transfer of engagements” to merge the two unions where the latter would switch its business to Derry. The proposal to members, which will be made at Derry Credit Unions agm on November , will be to vote on rubber-stamping the merger. Claudys members will be asked to do likewise at their own agm  hours later – a majority of members is needed to pass the proposal through. In the letter to his members, Mr Hegarty, wrote: “The merger with Claudy Credit Union will create a larger, well-resourced Derry Credit Union that will serve our combined common bond and reinforce our position as the leading credit union in Northern Ireland and in this region.     “We are excited by the opportunities that this merger will bring to our combined membership. “In coming together, we will broaden and enhance the range of services that we can offer to all our members, including additional online facilities and a wider-range of loan products. “It is you, our members, who will make the ultimate decision regarding this merger. Please take this opportunity to cast your vote and have your say in the future development of the credit union movement in the wider BT and BT postcode areas. “We firmly believe we are stronger together.” Meanwhile, Alliance Party Councillors, Rachael Fergusonand Philip McKinneyhave sent good wishes to the members of Derry and Claudy Credit Unions. “The two credit unions are considering merging together”, the Councillors said in a joint-statement. “Both Boards of Directors have approved a merger and they are recommending it to their members. And Derry Credit Union has already done its due diligence checks. So it looks like this merger will take place.” Cllr Ferguson added: “Derry Credit Union, once claimed to be the largest community-based credit union in the world, is an amazing success story. “It was founded only  years ago by  local people, with combined savings of pound.p – and now has over , members and over pound million of members savings.” Cllr McKinney said: “The whole Credit Union movement is a brilliant self-help story. “It has a proven track record across the world –  million members in over  countries. We wish well the members of Derry and Claudy credit unions in their coming decision.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry twins take on marathons on same day in dferent cities overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaCarraig Foam Party. . .

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year. We were slightly shocked to get booked so early as we had so far only presented an embryonic version of the show once and was a bit of a disaster technically. “We have done one more show since and its light years ahead now and very excited about presenting it on m screens.”  Any music over there you’d recommend  “Well i would definitely say check out Max’s new album ‘Turn of Phrase’, I’m extremely excited about working on the live presentation and its without doubt one of the best albums of the year. “My pal Yaws is also putting out some wild bendy tempo electronics that you will struggle to pin down. “Also,anyone is interested in the world of digital art and experimental music, I would check out Clot magazine ran by my wonderful other half.” www.clotmag news performance-maxwell-sterling-stephen-mclaughlin-a-v-at-space--london  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry twins take on marathons on same day in dferent cities overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Carriag Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaCarraig Foam Party. . .

In our society, that there continues to be injustice and inequality in our healthcare system is something that should shock us out of any potential apathy that all is rosy and well.ldquoAs we emerge from the pandemic, this should awaken us to action in a collective effort to take stock of where our health service is and what can be done to bring it to where it needs to be.Mr McGrath said healthcare staff must also be a priority for everyone as, without them, the health system would simply collapse.ldquoWithin the Downe Hospital for instance, we have seen staff moved about and relocated to other hospitals within the South Eastern Trust. And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed.

This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players. The feeling in the club as a whole at the minute is fantastic.ldquoMost of these girls are of minor age as wersquove lost a lot of our more experienced players to other commitments, so what they have achieved is remarkable.The manager added: ldquoWe knew Kilcoo were going to play using a sweeper, so we wanted to force their lsquokeeper into a long kick out that we were confident we would win. That game was won on the training ground.Kilcoo: S McEvoy, L Devlin, C McEvoy, C McClean, C McEvoy, E McEvoy, M Rogan, L Morgan, D McGreevy, R Doherty, C Kane, S Fettes, E Doyle, K Laverty, N Johnston.Subs: B McAneney, C McCrickard, C OrsquoRourke, C McEvoy Ireland, N OrsquoReilly, S McAneney, K Greenan, K McEvoy.Downpatrick: K Carling, C McKervey, O Boyle, O Beattie, N Loudon, A Trainor, V Scullion, K Turley, P Smyth, O Quinn, C Mulholland, K Convie, E Murphy, A Flynn, C Tumelty.Subs: M Shannon, R Trainor, A Doran, S Sloan, K McLeigh, G Scullion, N Madine, A Murphy, E McIlmurry, M Kelly, S Rice, K Trainor, M Ross..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_cd.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 24%2C 2001  ","story":"BISHOPSCOURT ndash The sale of Bishopscourt Motor Racing Circuit should be clinched later today.It has also been confirmed that the sprawling track, which was put on the market at the start of the month, will remain a race circuit.Yesterday afternoon the circuitrsquos current owners, David Beattie and John Gfin, were locked in crucial talks with potential owner, Jim OrsquoBrien from Newry, in a bid to finalise the deal.Although the going price for the circuit has not yet been confirmed it is believed the final bid may be in the region of half a million pounds.Last month the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surround its future.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal.

A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change.

Please try again later.Submitting...Emotional states, as any psychologist knows, grossly distort perceptions of reality.They are easy to manipulate via modern media and spin, whilst reason and rationality require scientic discipline and mental rigour.Woke issues are media-friendly precisely because they have emotional impact, and because the media are dominated by woke educated arts and humanities folk who lack real ‘scientic’ training.Further, most media folk are middle class, and woke issues don’t threaten their materially-comfortable lestyles.Thus banning speakers, political correctness, and emotional outrage don’t involve paying higher taxes to resource practical real solutions for example, providing better healthcare, welfare, or social services – things that really and inclusively help all races and creeds.One can still have a second home in France and feel emotionally good by being politically correct.Woke issues often do exist, like racial inequality, but their understanding of them and proposed solutions are infantile and downright dangerous - like, for example, where curbs on freedom of speech are concerned.They also ignore white inequalities, like working class deprivation in ‘post-industrial’ society, making working people feel bitter – hence Labour’s drubbing in Northern England.Yet the flight of the Left from reason has rational explanations, e.g. the collapse of the Soviet Bloc founded on Marx’s Enlightenment ideal of scientic socialism.The Left sought a quick alternative and found it in sloppy ‘touchy-feely’ politics, instant emotive issues, and symbolic gestures like toppling statues or political correctness.Marx would have scorned such empty, gesturing fools.Modern society is frequently unjust and re with real socio-economic and political problems, but the solutions lie in painstaking, tedious analysis and long-term planning, resources and delivery systems, not grand posturing.In such a world there is a serious need for a Left to challenge greedy self-interest - doing this is even fundamental to a liberal democratic society.Here, Ulster’s heritage could provide a template. Modern economics and Enlightenment thought actually has its roots in the Ulster moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson‘Father of the Scottish Enlightenment’ and man who taught Adam Smitheconomics .Both men were moral philosophers who would never advocate greedy self-interest.They saw the greatest virtue and happiness in dong good for ones community and fellow man .What Hutcheson taught Smith was that by removing articial constraints, from race to socio-economic disadvantage, over an inidual’s ability to develop their talents to the full enabled men to make a greater contribution to their community and fellow men.This Enlightened, moral dimension of market economicsis usually ignored.But it represents an ‘old’ Left critique of market economics, something which requires the rationality and reason of a disciplined mind - which modern woke-ism now eschews for emotive gestures.• James Dingley is a former international lecturer and NATO Instructor on terrorism and editor of: Combating Terrorism in Northern IrelandMore News Letter letters and opinion at this link——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Instead of bringing a baby home all I had was a little box with her footprints and photos.ldquoI didnrsquot deal with the aftermath very well at all ndash trying to grieve without being around my family was extremely hard.Cariad had a private funeral ndash attended only by her parents ndash at James Summers funeral home.ldquoThe funeral home was amazing ndash particularly Julie, said Ms Paskell.ldquoShe helped with everything, including reading a poem at Cariadrsquos funeral.This month would have marked Cariadrsquos first birthday ndash instead her mother is raising money for two charities: Aching Arms and Downrsquos Syndrome Association.ldquoAching Arms supported me personally, said Ms Paskell.ldquoI received a teddy bear from them, which is something to hold when my arms feel empty.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeaving the main car park and tramping pavements along Heol Gorllewin to pass the Prince of Wales pub, which features in the tale of the Maid of Sker, the group then entered the southern part of the vast Kenfig Burrows. These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why.

Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book.

The working group III report, due to be published next year, is responsible for assessing responses and solutions to climate change, by reducing emissions and enhancing ldquocarbon sinks such as forests.Unearthed reports that the majority of contributions were ldquoconstructive comments aimed at improving the report.A spokesman for the IPCC said processes used when drafting reports were ldquodesigned to guard against lobbying from all quarters.And UK scientists involved in the process rejected the idea they would be swayed by political lobbying.Prof Piers Forster, professor of climate change and Priestley Centre director, University of Leeds, said: ldquoIn my over  yearsrsquo experience of writing IPCC reports there has always been lobbying from multiple directions.ldquoIt is important to note that the authors get the last word as ultimately the report rests on peer reviewed science, not opinion.He said governments eventually agree the text unanimously, making it the trusted source of climate science for all countries.ldquoThis would not be possible unless all countries felt free to air their views and have them respected, listened to and responded to by the authors.Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: ldquoIPCC reports are scientic documents and the authors respond to review comments on the basis of their scientic merit.ldquoItrsquos important that government representatives can comment on the science, and very often they make valid, useful suggestions based on their own knowledge of the literature, but IPCC authors are keenly alert to the possibility of political pressure and strongly resist it.The leaks come ahead of the Cop conference, where countries face calls to increase action to cut emissions and prevent global warming of more than .C of above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the most dangerous impacts of climate change are expected.In the summer, the IPCC published the first part of its sixth assessment ndash after approval by governments ndash which issued a stark warning on how people were driving dangerous climate change.The report was labelled a ldquocode red for humanity.Commenting on the leaked documents, Greenpeace International executive director Jenner Morgan, said: ldquoThis is an insight into how a small group of coal, oil and meat producing countries continue to put the profits of a few polluting industries before science and our planetrsquos future.ldquoRather than phasing out fossil fuels and unsustainable meat production, they are using every opportunity to protect their corporate interests and continue with business as usual while the planet burns.ldquoAs the global spotlight moves to Glasgow, other world leaders should be aware of how far these governments will go to sabotage our chances of keeping .C in sight.ldquoThe key test for world leaders is whether or not they agree to rapidly phase out fossil fuels, as the science warrants.ldquoHistory will not be kind to themthey fail ndash and we will be watching, she warned..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Indian PM Modi to attend Cop climate conference in Glasgow article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
