That’s why.They said the metal was too thick for normal tin openers to cut through and often only scraped the surface.Many broke their tin openers while tackling the tin – and some fed up customers said they even resorted to using hammers, screwdrivers and chisels.They said the metal was too thick for normal tin openers to cut through and often only scraped the surface. (Picture: Pembo362 YouTube)Customers have long complained getting the lid off can be hit and miss.One YouTuber called Bill Kidgell, who was filmed smashing a screw driver into the tin with a hammer in a bid to open it, jokes: ‘It’s quite easy when you know how.And another YouTuber called Charlie posted a video of himself smashing the tin open with a big knife with the message: ‘Tin opener wouldn’t open so used the biggest chef’s knife I had and a hammer. lol.’Student blogger Pembo362 posted a video claiming: ‘This thing does not open.‘It is official, after three years of having this pie under my bed in my emergency food box it’s going in the bin.’It offered a link to the recommended opener which retails at £8.50 – seven times the cost of the common metal tin openers and four times as much as a classic Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie.Pie fans were still unhappy and Fray Bentos has now said it is putting the iconic tin under the design microscope in a bid to ‘improve openability’.Pie fans were still unhappy and Fray Bentos has now said it is putting the iconic tin under the design microscope in a bid to ‘improve openability’. (Picture: Bill Kidgell YouTube)A spokesperson for Baxters Food Group said: ‘Since Baxters Food Group acquired Fray Bentos six years ago, we have worked closely with Crown Packaging (the Fray Bentos pie can manufacturers) to improve the openability of the can without compromising the integrity or quality of the Fray Bentos product.‘Based on consumer feedback the focus has been on improving the tin profile (ridges on the lid).‘We have conducted a number of trials, and while we have managed a slight improvement, we have concluded that the cans require a robust ‘cut from the top’ opener rather than a ‘cut from the side’ opener.‘Budget tin openers will not deliver consistent results.‘Moving to a ring pull lid has been considered, however due to the surface area and force required to lift the lid, this may result in serious injury to the consumer.‘This has been discounted as a potential solution.‘Whilst we continue to review the design of our can, based on consumer feedback we would strongly advise our consumers to use a robust can opener.‘We are in the process of updating this on our packaging. We have updated our website to reflect this recommendation.’Fray Bentos tinned steak and kidney pies first hit supermarket shelves in 1961."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12197208.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"pet dog was actually a black bear and now weighs 250lbs","story":"A Chinese family raised their pet dog for two years before discovering that it was actually a black bear.Su Yun from Kunming in the Yunnan province thought she bought a Tibetan mastiff puppy but grew suspicious when the animal started walking on two legs.Now a fully grown black bear, the ‘pet’ weighs 250lbs.Ms Yun told China News: ‘The more he grew, the more like a bear he looked.’She added: ‘I’m a little scared of bears.’But were surprise to discover that the ‘pet’ grew into a huge black bear (Picture: Pear Video)The family bought the pet while on holiday in 2016.The animal has been identified as an endangered Asiatic Black Bear, which would have been sold for thousands on the black market.Nursery teacher filmed pushing pupil before pulling chair out from under herStaff were so intimidated by the animal, who can be seen in the video standing over 3ft tall, that they sedated it before transporting it from the family’s home.MORE: This is why throwing sticks for dogs can be fatalMORE: 37 Palestinian protesters killed as Donald Trump hails US Embassy move to Jerusalem"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/15/4C2D1CC100000578-5721671-R_B_singer_R_Kelly_delivered_a_raunchy_performance_for_a_crowd_o-m-18_1526222121932.jpg","title":"Apple wont promote R Kelly music featured playlists","story":"The 51-year-old began performing in the 80s and made his official debut in 1992 with the group Public Announcement.

They have been published in newspapers, magazines and on websites around the world.          1. Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle          2. The photographer scans the computer booths for the best viewpoint as Mr Markle heads to the front counter to pay to get online  3. Mr Markle and the photographer book time to use one of the computers, but are secretly planning to choreograph a photoshootIn all of them Mr Markle appears to be unaware they are being taken. But we can today reveal they were in fact contrived and shot with his co-operation. It is not known if he was paid to take part.The faked images include Mr Markle apparently:Being measured for a suit to wear to the wedding – in fact the ‘tailor’ was an assistant at a party goods shop recruited for the job as the suit hire store the photographer planned to use was closed.Being caught browsing a book of British landmarks in a branch of Starbucks – although he actually arrived at the cafe with the photographer, and set up the shot.Working out with weights to get in shape for the big day – but the pictures appear to have been taken on a waste tip, an unlikely place to exercise but away from prying eyes.The revelation that Mr Markle has been co-operating with a paparazzo behind the backs of his daughter, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace officials will cause huge embarrassment to the Royal Family in the run-up to the wedding. It will be galling for Harry who, in a BBC documentary last year, hit out at the paparazzi for the way in which they pursued his mother, Princess Diana. She was killed in Paris in 1997 after being chased by photographers.And shortly after his relationship with Meghan became public in 2016, the Prince made a heartfelt plea for the media to respect the privacy of Meghan and her family.Last night, just hours ahead of our exposé, represenatives of Mr Markle wrote to editors around the world and to British newspaper watchdog the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Editors were told that he was suffering as a result of media intrusion and did not want to participate in photocalls or interviews.          4. In this grainy image, the figure of Mr Markle sitting at a desk in front of a computer screen can just about be made out, while behind him Rayner uses his long lens to capture pictures he later sells for sizeable fees          5. Rayner trains his lens on Mr Markle, who is in the corner of the cafe, reading stories about Harry and Meghan but looking at the screen at an odd angle          ... to produce this lucrative shot which was flogged to the world\u0027s unsuspecting mediaKensington Palace officials did the same a few weeks before. An official letter, written by Prince Harry’s communications secretary Jason Knauf, described how Mr Markle had been ‘followed and harassed’ by photographers and journalists. The letter urged editors not to publish pictures of Mr Markle and called on them to stop pursuing him.Mail on Sunday reporters have established that Mr Markle and Rayner, a 44-year-old Los Angeles-based photographer, set up at least four photoshoots.

Samantha tweeted the official Kensington Palace Twitter account and said: \u0027The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault. The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money\u0027.           Samantha, speaking from Florida, insists that the staging of photographs was so her father would be seen in a more positive lightLast night Kensington Palace was silent about claims that Meghan Markle’s father had secretly collaborated to stage a series of ‘faked’ photographs in the run-up to the royal wedding.The palace refused to comment on the allegations, but it is understood there is no change to plans for Mr Markle to walk the bride down the aisle of St George’s Chapel on Saturday.Both Prince Harry and Miss Markle however, are likely to be embarrassed by the revelations that Mr Markle secretly posed for pictures showing him being ‘measured’ for his wedding suit and browsing articles about his daughter and the Queen’s grandson in an internet cafe.Yesterday The Mail on Sunday reported that Mr Markle, 73, an award-winning former Hollywood lighting director who now lives a reclusive life in Mexico, had worked with US-based photographer, Jeff Rayner, to set up the lucrative photo deal.It is not known whether Mr Markle was paid for his involvement.The disclosure came after warnings to the media from Kensington Palace about alleged harassment by photographers of both Miss Markle’s parents.          Samantha Markle, pictured with her famous half-sister in 2008, has said it\u0027s her fault their father agreed to appear in staged photos on the eve of the royal wedding          Photographer Jeff Rayner, camera slung over his shoulder, arrives at the Omega internet cafe at 9.50am on March 27 with Thomas Markle, it emerged on Sunday  Thomas Markle\u0027s son (left), Thomas Jr (right), has said his father plans to apologise to Meghan Markle for the stunt that has left him and his family \u0027deeply embarrassed\u0027Privately there was some concern last night over Mr Markle’s ability to cope with the pressure of this week’s royal wedding.It is understood that he has long ‘struggled’ to handle the immense global interest in his daughter’s romance. And he is said to be feeling ‘significant stress’ about this week’s events, which will see him travel to the UK, take tea with the Queen and meet up with Meghan’s mother, his ex-wife Doria Ragland.Samantha Markle, who is estranged from her Suits star sibling, has previously called for Prince Harry to ‘man up’.There has been a bitter row because Meghan and Harry haven\u0027t invited her and her brother.  She accused the Queen’s grandson of rank hypocrisy in offering ‘shout outs about humanitarianism’ while allowing ‘Meg to ignore the Markles’.‘Someone must point out that the ‘Emperor is not wearing any clothes’,’ the 53-year-old raged.The royal bride to be has suffered a number of embarrassments at the hands of her dysfunctional family yesterday.Her estranged half-brother branded her a ‘phoney Diana’ and wrote an open letter to Harry saying it\u0027s not \u0027too late\u0027 for him to call off the wedding.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday, May 19, in Windsor      Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will not have a sitdown wedding breakfast after their ceremony on Saturday – but have plumped for trendy ‘bowl food’ instead            The Royal Kitchen at Windsor Castle has begun preparations for the wedding banquet    Pictured the Royal Palaces Head chef Mark Flanagan (right) and the Royal Palaces Pastry chef Selwyn Stoby (left)Still, Harry and Meghan hope that it will make the occasion less fussy and allow them to move around the room greeting as many guests as possible.Guests will also feast on canapes during the lunchtime reception, which will last around two and a half hours and includes speeches and cutting of the cake. Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/11/17/4C1A45A800000578-0-image-m-24_1526055185140.jpg","title":"Ecuador foreign minister working UK resolve Assange situation","story":"    María Fernanda Espinosa, foreign minister of Ecuador, has said she is working with the UK and a \u0027team of lawyers\u0027 to \u0027resolve\u0027 Julian Assange\u0027s stay in the London embassyIn remarks quoted by Spanish news agency Agencia EFE, she said Ecuador was in \u0027constant communication\u0027 with the United Kingdom and a \u0027team of lawyers\u0027.\u0027We are looking for an exit, but that exit has to be framed within the international law of human rights,\u0027 she said.Asylum seeker killed sex worker two months after he was due...\u0027I still get nightmares\u0027: Wife of Libyan dissident reveals...Share this articleThe Wikileaks founder has been holed up in the Knightsbridge embassy since 2012 following attempt to extradite him to Sweden amid rape and sexual assault allegations. Assange, who helped leak of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables that year, denied the claims and said they were politically motivated.Swedish prosecutors have since  dropped their investigation into allegations against Assange, but he fears he will be extradited to the United States if he leaves.

This reversal of fortune for the economy partly, though far from fully, reflects broader pressure created by the US dollar’s recent appreciation – a process that is set to accelerate, because both monetary policy and growth differentials are now favouring the US.For a while now, the US Federal Reserve has been well ahead of other systemically important central banks in normalising monetary policy – that is, raising interest rates, eliminating large-scale asset purchases, and starting the multi-year process of shrinking its balance sheet. This was amplified this year by another catalyst of the dollar’s recent appreciation a growing, and less favourable, ergence between economic data and expectations in the rest of the world.Now, there is less external capital chasing returns in Europe and the emerging economies, and some that was there has already flowed back home. So economic and financial factors can be expected to continue to fuel the appreciation of the US dollar. The only way to ease that upward pressure, and to mitigate spillovers, is with effective policy responses.The good news is that there are sufficient tools to reduce the risk of dislocations. But there is a need for broader implementation within inidual economies, and better coordination across borders.To be sure, some may view the US dollar’s appreciation as consistent with a longer-term rebalancing of the global economy. But, as Argentina’s situation demonstrates, excessively sharp and sudden appreciation of such a systemically important currency risks unbalancing things elsewhere.Emerging markets have long been particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon. In the run-up to the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, many emerging economies kept their currencies rigidly pegged to the dollar, and governments tended to borrow heavily in dollars, despite generating most of their revenues in the domestic currency (what economists labeled “original sin”).As the dollar appreciated in international markets, these economies became less competitive and experienced sharp deteriorations in their current-account positions. Actual and potential capital outflows forced central banks to raise local interest rates, intensifying economic contractionary pressures and undermining the creditworthiness of the domestic corporate sector. Currency devaluation was not an easy option, either, as it would boost inflation and send the costs of servicing external debts soaring to prohibitively high levels.Many developing countries now have flexible exchange rates, and, by shifting to domestic sources of borrowing, they have reduced the currency mismatches associated with their liabilities. Yet two vulnerabilities remain.First, the recent extraordinary period of repressed volatility in financial markets, ultra-low interest rates, and dollar weakness unleashed another surge of capital flows to emerging countries, including “tourist dollars,” which tend to flow right back out at the first sign of trouble. Second, empowered by exceptionally generous global financing conditions, a growing number of emerging-market corporates have resorted to external dollar borrowing, materially increasing their financial vulnerability to higher interest rates and adverse currency moves.Externally driven changes in financial variables have thus become a source of serious risk, especially in countries, like Argentina, with a history of economic mismanagement, large current account deficits, other financial imbalances and a habit of pursuing too many objectives with too few instruments. With the emerging-market economies still structurally subject to short-term risks of contagion, it is usually just a matter of time until a few countries’ problems result in a tightening of financial conditions for the asset class as a whole.Beyond challenging emerging markets’ stability, a sudden and sharp appreciation of the US dollar – and, specifically, the losses in trade competitiveness that it causes – threatens to complicate already-delicate trade negotiations. In particular, efforts to modernise the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and to establish fairer trade relations between the US and China could be put at risk.Against this background, policymakers should be implementing measures that take pressure off foreign-exchange markets. This includes, first and foremost, pro-growth policies, particularly for Europe, which, despite recent economic gains, faces significant structural headwinds. Emerging economies, meanwhile, should focus on maintaining solid balance sheets, improving their understanding of market dynamics, and safeguarding policy credibility.Country-level measures should be reinforced by better global policy coordination, especially to help avoid or break vicious cycles. The IMF, which may soon face more requests for financing, has an important role to play here. Using a bit of extra precaution now is obviously preferable to risking a mess that will need to be cleaned up later.• Mohamed A El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz and was chairman of Barack Obama’s Global Development Council"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95284de8dc3f2c4524ccd78650b3f15486ce94e/0_0_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c81f8deec6f38b9e34273ecfd2e3940","title":"big society safety net predators vulnerable","story":"In place of the ‘big society’ we were so fatuously promised, we have growing numbers of loan sharks and slumlordsIt may be hard to believe, in the midst of a benefit sanctions regime that sees one in five universal credit applications turned down, and a “hostile environment” that directly led to the Windrush scandal, but most of the current Conservative government also stood at the 2010 general election with a campaign that centred on something called the “big society”.

It’s a philosophy that contains a toxic mix of soft-focus nostalgia for a time that never was, and quasi-religious moralising that sees poverty not as a scourge to be eradicated but a tool for disciplining society’s undeserving into better behaviour.Predictably, this experiment in social engineering did not reveal a hidden population of people with the time and money to spare who had just been held back by the stifling provision of basic public services. The gaps left by the slash-and-burn policies of the Cameron-era coalition were filled not by an army of cheerful local volunteers, but by predators who saw other people’s vulnerability as an opportunity for profit.As Jennifer Williams reported in the Manchester Evening News, the city’s homelessness crisis has provided a rich opportunity for unscrupulous landlords offering “temporary housing” facilities that are often neither temporary nor really housing, except in the broadest possible interpretation, with people living for years in squalid, dangerous buildings. Vulnerable people are given a stark choice – live in a rundown, dirty, unmaintained and insecure environment, or risk life on the streets. The charitable organisation Justlife estimates that there are tens of thousands of households in the UK living in unsupported temporary accommodation, over and above the official homelessness figures.As the big society gave way to the hostile environment, so too did the dangers to which migrants were exposed. In their Women Living in a Hostile Environment report, the End Violence Against Women Coalition says: “The impact of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) conditions on migrant women who have suffered domestic abuse and are financially or otherwise dependent on their spouse or partner has been devastating.” Unable to go to the police or seek public support for fear of falling foul of the Home Office’s opaque rules and obsession with deportation targets, women find themselves dependent on and unable to leave abusive partners.From loan sharks to exploitative employers, rogue landlords to domestic abusers, rolling back basic public services has created opportunities for the unscrupulous to take advantage of those with nowhere else to turn. The big society has become the predatory society.The existence of a forgotten and neglected underclass of people is not something unique to the Conservatives’ time in office. Vulnerable people and those who prey on them are not new. The safety nets in the UK have often been badly maintained and easy to slip through, but the Tory solution has been to blame the safety net itself rather than its design, and then to work to make it even worse.The right wing will argue that this is a negative view of humanity, that they, and they alone, believe that people are noble of spirit and capable of rising above their circumstances. Rather than telling people to rely on “handouts” we should be encouraging them to pull their socks up and get on their bikes. But poverty is a social phenomenon, and public services were the tools that we built to enable people to rise above it. Being poor is exhausting and stressful, and running the gauntlet of a predatory society is a full-time job in itself.At the sharp end of a brutal and precarious society, people do not have the time or resources to perform the role of “we were poor but we were happy” peasants for the edification of privately schooled landowners looking to justify their monopolistic hoarding of the nation’s wealth. Those who find themselves in this situation are regarded as unworthy and undeserving and therefore eminently ignorable – and it’s easy to do when the people tearing up the safety nets are also writing the rules about what counts as deserving. As the late Terry Pratchett observed: “While it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be living in a slum, for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got you invited to the very best social occasions.”Tory policy can – and should – be reversed, but to truly make a difference we have to see through the bankrupt ideology that tries to reimagine letting economic predators off the leash as being socially progressive. Rather than sanctions or deportation targets, we should be setting the target that everyone should have access to a life worthy of living. There should always be an alternative to the loan shark and the slumlord, but it won’t just appear because rightwing theorists say it should. The work has to be put in to make sure everyone has somewhere to turn other than the predators in our society. If not, then what is to stop them taking advantage?• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f340cef1fe07c23809d8d8480d91d8e3d32f254f/0_81_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9e1b06a607e7f01107362b939396c91","title":"david miliband theresa may brexit tory european economic area","story":"When David Miliband fled to New York to run the International Rescue Committee, he cannot have imagined his old country would be most in need of his services. Britain now needs all the help it can get, even from superannuated expatriate politicians. By the autumn the government will have had to choose between the devil of a messy but feasible hotchpotch of soft Brexit and the deep blue sea of no deal. We can dance on the head of a pin for so long, but this year there has to be a choice.Today, at an Open Reason event in Essex, a tri-party trio of Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan are seeking to advance the cause of a version of the customs unionsingle market called the European Economic Area (EEA), as enjoyed by Norway. This would not reverse the referendum, an outcome futilely sought by remain fundamentalists. It would honour Brexit, while also honouring Theresa May’s claimed commitment to “frictionless” trade. Each of the “issues” – control on aspects of migration, no border in Ulster, ad hoc deals with third parties – can be accommodated, up to a point, within the terms of an EEA negotiation.May should now slam her fist on the cabinet table and say yes to Miliband, Clegg and Morgan. She should say yes to the 14 Lords amendments to the Brexit bill now returning to the Commons. She should say yes to a clear majority of her cabinet and all MPs. She should say yes to public opinion. The EEA is the one sensible and consensual compromise through this mess.Against it stands the apparently insuperable obstacle of the prime minister’s lack of guts. She is in awe of a group of diehards in her cabinet and on her backbenches.May undoubtedly faces the greatest crisis of Tory leadership in a generation, and there is no question this involves personal risk. She must rescind some of her more reckless hard-Brexit pledges. She will face the resignation of ministers and a probable leadership challenge. But it is doubtful if such a rebellion will terminally undermine her position. Leaders have faced such crises before – as did John Major when he called the bluff of a similar rebellion in 1995.Seeking a parliamentary consensus is the proper constitutional way forward. May should be able to win support this autumn for a realistic negotiating strategy in Brussels, irrespective of her party’s internal disputes. For the next year, such an outbreak of sanity could lead Britain to a new, perhaps even constructive, semi-detachment from the EU. It would serve the national interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d980902e926aa8fccccb3aea86394ef0db16b25c/0_0_2705_4134/master/2705.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ad98b96d88b342955480c6c3910bb4bc 2020w","title":"juventus extend my7h a success to celebrate or a cause for lament","story":"The all-conquering Old Lady has no plans to abdicate her throne even with the inevitable summer changes aheadLast May, the commemorative T-shirts celebrated a “Le6end”. This year, Juventus went with “My7h”. Even as players popped champagne corks for the second time in four days at Rome’s Stadio Olimpico, it was tempting to imagine a marketing team somewhere planning the slogans and hashtags for the next round of celebrations in 12 months.Seven consecutive Scudetti. No club had even won six in a row before the Bianconeri embarked on their present run. Across Europe’s top five leagues, only Lyon, at the start of this century, have enjoyed such an uninterrupted spell of domestic dominance. Even then, they did not pair Ligue 1 success with cup triumphs. Juve’s 0-0 draw with Roma on Sunday sealed an unprecedented fourth straight Serie A and Coppa Italia double.Whether that is an achievement to celebrate, or a cause for lament might depend on your perspective. The front page of Monday’s La Repubblica sport section reminded us: “Hegemonies do not help a system to grow.”Beneath that headline, Angelo Carotenuto drew links between the advent of pay TV and a diminished competitiveness: accusing clubs of prioritising comfortable economics over competitive championships. Even in Spain, he noted, where a duopoly exists, other clubs have found success in Europe.There is merit to such arguments, and it is true that too few Italian clubs have shown the ambition Juventus did in building their own ground at the start of this decade, as well as adapting in other ways to the modern commercial environment. Since moving into what is now the Allianz Stadium, Juventus have won the league every year and increased their annual revenues almost three-fold.And yet, in this specific season, is it fair to put the Old Lady’s success down to a lack of competition? Napoli’s title challenge fell apart at the crucial moment, but with a victory over Sampdoria they nevertheless reached 88 points: a club record in Serie A. If they win at home to Crotone on the final weekend, they will become the first team to fail to win the Scudetto with more than 90.Juventus are too strong, too unerringly consistent. Finances have skewed the playing field, but we ought not let that obscure the fact that their achievement is astonishing. The wealthiest clubs will generally prevail in football, but it is not true that they always do – see Monaco and Leicester.Perhaps, if Juventus were still performing as poorly in Europe, their achievements might be easier to dismiss. But this team has been to two of the past three Champions League finals and was eliminated this year by a last-minute goal away at the Bernabéu.It is the resilience of this team that marks it apart. Juventus had been atrocious in the first leg against Madrid, yet somehow attacked the return game with the conviction of a side that still believed it could find a way through.Domestically, they always do. Juventus were four points behind Napoli when they travelled there in December. The Partenopei were playing the better football. Massimiliano Allegri had his team dig in and grind out an uninspiring but nerveless 1-0 victory.Similarly, when Napoli beat them in Turin and seemed to blow the title race wide open, Juventus refused to yield. From 2-1 down to Inter in the 87th minute at San Siro one week later, they emerged with a win.Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri defined that as the moment when the race ended. His team had been watching at their hotel in Florence. Deflated, they slumped to a 3-0 defeat against Fiorentina. It was an almost identical scenario to the one in March, when Juventus stole an injury-time win out of nowhere at Lazio, before Napoli imploded against Roma.Since 2014, Juventus have bid farewell to Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal, Paul Pogba, Carlos Tevez, Álvaro Morata and Leonardo Bonucci, to name but a few. Allegri has adapted and reinvented each season, never seeming to rush in the new arrivals but typically getting the most out of them by the end.He never even found a settled formation this time around. In 37 league games, Juventus have used 36 different line-ups. Along the way, Allegri found ways to integrate Federico Bernardeschi, Mattia De Sciglio and Wojciech Szczesny. He took a slowly-slowly approach with Douglas Costa, and now has him looking like this team’s brightest star.“I will need to speak to the directors,” said Allegri when asked if he planned to stay, amid reports linking him with Chelsea and Arsenal. “Tomorrow I’m going to the seaside but if they don’t send me away then I will be back next year … Some people will leave, some will arrive. Whatever happens we want more victories.”Among those departing will be Gigi Buffon, barring any late reversal of his decision to retire. This was the goalkeeper’s ninth Serie A title – excluding those revoked as a result of Calciopoli – a record no other player can equal. Yet the fact that he did not play on Sunday, leaving space for Szczesny, was a reminder of how this team has worked to plan ahead throughout this era of dominance.Juventus’s summer transfer campaign is already well under way, with Emre Can expected to arrive from Liverpool, along with Mattia Caldara and Leonardo Spinazzola from Atalanta. More will follow. Nowhere is it written that this run must end at seven. The Old Lady has no plans to abdicate her throne.• Roma will also return to the Champions League, but we don’t know which team will join them. At least Lazio had the twin excuses of playing against a Crotone side fighting for survival, and without Ciro Immobile and Luis Alberto. Inter were beaten 2-1 at home by Sassuolo. Nevertheless, they can take fourth if they win at Lazio.• Milan and Atalanta will take the final Europa League spots, barring a defeat for the latter, and a seven-goal swing to Fiorentina. The Viola lost their cool on what was supposed to be a day to celebrate Davide Astori, losing 1-0 at home to Cagliari (whom the defender also represented) in a game that ended with scuffles on the pitch and both Fiorentina midfielder Jordan Veretout and manager Stefano Pioli sent off.• Cagliari’s win lifted them out of the relegation zone and, combined with victories for Udinese and Chievo, dumped Crotone back into 18th spot.• Sampdoria’s game at home to Napoli was halted for several minutes in response to discriminatory chants from the home support towards people from Naples. Samp’s owner, Massimo Ferrero, even walked out to plead with fans and appeared to be heeded, although only after being abused himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f81d195d6bacc6063c9050121b95064a7d5bca76/211_713_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50cf69d7c26cd2ac3c90acc73d3ea4f5","title":"premier league 2017 18 review innovations we need for the future","story":"Let’s introduce injury bins and close-of-play hooters. And can we ban fans, usually young ones, from begging for a shirts? There is a coming-together on the pitch, perhaps two players rising to contest a high ball or a player on the run being dispossessed by a sliding challenge. One, whose team are leading, stays down. He appears to be in pain. The physio is beckoned on and kneels over his man to administer treatment. After a while the ailing player is helped to his feet and is led, limping gingerly and wincing in apparent agony, from the field. But it is as if an invisible, all-healing forcefield rings the pitch, because the moment he hobbles across the white line he spins and demands to return to the fray. The referee waves him on and he sprints back to his position, suddenly in rude health. Attempting to deceive the referee by feigning injury is a bookable offence, for unsporting behaviour, but in these circumstances it is absolutely never punished, and not only does this tactic steal chunks of action from almost every match it often interrupts the flow, esting teams of momentum. It is, in short, cheating, and annoying. Unless officials can properly enforce the law concerning unsporting behaviour, even retrospectively, another option is required. So how about giving each stricken player 60 seconds to get on with play, after which – unless they are bleeding, in which case they are already forced off the pitch for as long as it takes to stem the flow – they are obliged to leave the field for a period of no less than five minutes. You never know, the idea of placing your team at a numerical advantage might prove to have surprising restorative powers.To aid the tension and uncertainty that surrounds stoppage time, I offer a simple proposition, borrowed from rugby league: as soon as the referee believes that sufficient additional time has been played at the end of each half, an aggressively loud hooter is sounded. From that point, play continues indefinitely until the ball goes out of play (fouls conceded by the team not in possession don’t count – you can’t just kick someone to end a match), at which point the halfgame is over. This is probably only a very marginal improvement on the status quo, and many matches would end with nothing more dramatic than the player in possession when the hooter sounds immediately blootering the ball into row Z, but in certain close-fought games I believe it would add a pleasing bonus period of total chaos.An unpleasant recent novelty has been a rise in the number of young fans going to games with signs beseeching a particular player to give them his shirt. Why do you want a dirty shirt? It’s just another thing in a world full of things. If you go home and try to tidy your bedroom, you’ll find you’ve already got more than enough things. And dirty shirts aren’t even good things. Creating a shirt-begging sign suggests an expectation that a free shirt might be the result from that moment if he or she does get the shirt the moment will have been stripped of innocence and spontaneity, and if they end the day empty-handed they will be disappointed. I’m not suggesting players shouldn’t give away their shirts, however dirty and useless they are. The point is, and this is something I believe very strongly, children who go to matches with signs asking for things are precisely the children who should not be given things."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309b2ae262623202fc993916a2b7d7e12c358bde/0_279_5172_3105/master/5172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a65743239b5fd910a2280abf5478d60","title":"arsenal the arsene wenger years in pictures","story":"As Arsène Wenger prepares to hang up his famous coat for the last time, we take a look at some of the highs and lows of his career at Arsenal, as seen through the lens of  and Observer photographer Tom Jenkins "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1651037032e95965f8e7f2923b593a03c9b55007/487_973_5055_3034/master/5055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c576395fa97d3783ba9cdbb2e10cc6d4","title":"life microcephaly afghanistan in pictures","story":"In an impoverished country where support is limited at best, people with disabilities must look to their families for help.

The Coca-Colas were kept ice cold, and appear as essential to her writing routine as quiet and light. Those who pledged $50 or more to the crowdfunding of Griffin’s film received a copy of her personal cookbook. A scrapbook of food clippings from magazines, menus of the meals she served at dinner parties (for Patti Smith she made chicken hash with roasted yellow peppers and baguettes) and food-stained recipes, handwritten, with terse crossing-outs, its most revealing page was the recipe for a parsley salad, less as an illustration of her diet, or even for the way its sparse style reflects her prose, but more as an insight into her social reach: the salad feeds up to 40.It’s not just that her recipes reveal her – reading her work you see Didion discovers herself this way too. In the notes she scribbled when covering the Patty Hearst trial in 1976 she unpicks her privilege through memories of fancy meals, mid-flight, “Lunching Aloft on Beltsville Roast Turkey with Dressing and Giblet Sauce,” then, “Stuffed Celery au Roquefort over the Rockies”.Though she dwindled to 75 pounds, cooking seems to be for Didion, now 83, one of the rituals that helped her keep on living when everything (John died at the dinner table as she mixed a salad Quintana died two years later, at 39) had shattered around her. After Dunne’s death there was a period when all she ate was congee in the documentary she cuts the crusts off a cucumber sandwich while she reads from The Year of Magical Thinking, her report from the frontline of grief. Translating it into a play, David Hare took the opportunity to plump her up. He set up a table in the theatre, and a sign: Cafe Didion. Here he’d insist she ate, croissants and jam in the morning, sandwiches at lunch.It seems reductive to tie Didion so tightly to death, but it’s there even in her recipe book. From the parsley salad for 40, the quantities shrink as time passes, to 12, to 8, to the cucumber sandwich, for one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0daf9254a0056460ba557b350845ea71a740149e/0_1679_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7f8bcba6ea1690e2edfa05c6555dbc","title":"anna jones recipe cooking lettuce","story":"Give salads a new dimension by charring leaves or simmering them into a spring soupI’m not sure who came up with the idea of cooking lettuce, but they should be applauded because, however ridiculous it may seem, a cooked lettuce will almost always triumph.

Cut the lettuces in half lengthways, and then again into quarters.Tear the bread into bite-size pieces, put on to a baking tray, drizzle generously with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper, then put into the oven to toast until lightly golden – about five to 10 minutes.Meanwhile, griddle the little gems for a couple of minutes on each side, until deep char marks form and they collapse a little. Lay the charred lettuces on a platter, season with a little salt and set aside.Next, make the dressing: finely grate the garlic into a food processor, add all the other ingredients with six tablespoons of water, and blitz smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon, salt, pepper and soy to taste.When the croutons are ready, take them out of the oven and sprinkle with the lemon zest and some parmesan, then put them back in the oven for another minute or two.To serve, toss the charred lettuce in a few tablespoons of the dressing, then put it on to a platter, scatter with the croutons and grate over the rest of the parmesan.

Push the lettuce under the liquid as much as you can, cover and simmer for another two minutes, giving the lettuce time to wilt, then turn off the heat and add the herbs.Use a hand blender or a jug blender to whizz the soup until it’s as smooth as you like it, thinning with a little more hot stock, if you like. Taste and add more salt and pepper – or even a squeeze of lemon if you think it needs some sharpness.Either return the soup to the pan to keep warm, or let it cool, then chill for a few hours until it’s cold. If serving chilled, check the seasoning again before serving, because it may need more salt.I like to serve mine topped with a swirl of yoghurt, a few drops of olive oil, a few more fresh peas, sliced radishes and a tangle of pea shoots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68848834eed98422f2546a6789f8ebd0c2ead6ee/0_154_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d0f8b4e0836428d18bcc2a5abbb115","title":"seven ways to deal with hay fever","story":"Try to stay indoors as much as you can on high-pollen days. In particular, avoid outdoor activity between 10am and 4pm, the peak time for pollen dissemination. The best time to be outside is after rain, which helps to clear pollen from the air. If you are outside on high-pollen days, taking precautions such as putting petroleum jelly around your nostrils to trap pollen and wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop it getting into your eyes can help.Wash your hands often. On high-pollen days, make sure you shower and wash your hair when you get home home, since pollen can collect on your skin, hair and clothes throughout the day. Make sure you wash bed sheets weekly in hot water.Keep windows and doors shut as much as possible to prevent pollen from settling in your home and consider buying a dehumidifier to keep the indoor air as dry as possible. Portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can help keep your bedroom pollen-free, while many experts suggest using a vacuum cleaner with an inbuilt HEPA filter. In the car, try to use air conditioning rather than opening the window on hot days, particularly when the pollen count is high.Avoid hanging laundry outside to dry, since your clothes can trap pollens. Gardening chores such as mowing the lawn and weeding can trigger hay fever attacks, so consider wearing a filter mask while doing such activities.Dairy products and sugary foods can exacerbate common hay fever symptoms such as nasal congestion, because they increase the production of mucus in the respiratory tract. Try alternatives to dairy such as almond milk and rice milk and try to supplement your diet with foods that have natural antihistamine properties such as broccoli, asparagus, onions, garlic, cherries, pineapple and kiwi fruit.Antihistamines are the most common hay fever medications. While they are associated with side-effects such as drowsiness, more modern antihistamines such as cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine are less likely to make you sleepy. You may need to try several types to find which works best for you consult a pharmacist for advice. If you see that high pollen counts are forecast, start taking medication before your symptoms begin.Herbal remedies such as licorice tea, nettle tea and ginger and honey may help relieve symptoms such as congestion and itchiness, since they help to reduce respiratory tract inflammation. The tea should be steeped for at least eight minutes to ensure that the crucial ingredients are present in a higher concentration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a12da554894d91e31d43b1488dd6057ba58dda/0_0_8533_5120/master/8533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e533ade59ef45e5da66b1ae58d7d3792","title":"tried everything to cure premature ejaculation","story":"I have had this problem for 12 years and nothing I have tried – from medication to yoga and therapy – has helped. It is ruining my relationships with womenI am 27 years old and have been battling premature ejaculation since I first had sex at 15. It was one of the main causes of my seven-year relationship breaking up, and has left me feeling insecure about my relationships with women. I have tried everything from medication (paroxetine) to yoga (vinyasa yoga to control breathing, as well as tantric yoga) to seeing sex therapists and changing my diet. Nothing seems to work. Sex is a huge part of a relationship and is one of the main ways to express your love, but I have faced nothing but frustration in this aspect of my relationship with women.It is usually possible to learn to delay ejaculation by identifying one’s point of “ejaculatory inevitability”, then practising the art of taking a controlled pause before it overtakes. It is best to first try this “stop-start” technique during masturbation. Once a man is able to halt his race to ejaculation during self-pleasuring, he can try to achieve it during manual or oral stimulation by a partner, or during intercourse – ideally beginning with what is, for him, the least exciting.This latter part of the protocol is best tried with an understanding and willing partner. And on this note, it is worth remembering that not all women enjoy prolonged intercourse in fact, some much prefer to have a short period of thrusting – especially those who mainly reach orgasm through manual or oral stimulation. In fact, if you learn to pleasure partners to orgasm without engaging your penis – before or after you have ejaculated – they will be highly satisfied and are unlikely to complain about shorter intercourse.You seem to have erroneously come to simply labeled yourself as an “early ejaculator”’ when you are a man with a wide range of attributes that must make you desirable to a partner and worthy of love. Try, therefore, to gain a broader perspective regarding all your positive qualities, and appreciate what you can contribute to a relationship.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@the (please don’t send attachments).

It remains superb.Its streets are wide and nobly lined with mansions and offices that would flatter a capital. It has rich museums, universities, theatres and 50 dance halls. It has well-kept parks and a graceful river. This is a great city with a character as strong and pleasing as its national drink.But it is also a city that considers itself in trouble. It believes itself to be in the grip of a crime wave, not so much of robbery as of a degenerate, mindless, pointless violence. This week, for example, a 16-year-old boy, who could not run away because he had an artificial leg, was stabbed three times by young strangers in a park. They ran away, shouting “Shamrock”. A 12-year-old boy, the son of a policeman, waiting at a bus stop, was slashed down his jaw-line with a razor. And again there was no reason for an attack that was as casual as a smile at a pretty girl. A girl looking into a shop window with friends was stabbed in the back, apparently because she had refused to kiss a strange young man.The worst of Glasgow’s recent experiences came over the Easter weekend. Then there were 21 serious assaults and 25 robberies with violence. Nearly 100 people were injured. A boy coming home from church on Good Friday was stabbed by a youthful gang and died on the pavement in his father’s arms. There were 132 brutal attacks in Glasgow in March. There were 56 in the same time a year ago.It is a mysterious business and it is not clear if the situation is worse than in other comparable cities. Violence and its punishment was a major issue in the recent local elections and the Tories first and then the Labour candidates made it one of their chief claims to authority. There are demands for sterner punishments and for more powers of search and arrest for the police, though they would seem to have all that a civilised policeman could require.There were famous fights in the 1920s and 30s when gangs of up to 300 fought each other on the streets. Now Lord Carmont, a judge who handed down punishment like an outraged god, is remembered with longing. He is accorded the honour of having diminished razor slashing. The knife has taken its place and the convenient broken bottle remains.Extract from an article, published in the Observer on 19 May 1968, entitled ‘Where the violence is as casual as the smile of a pretty girl’, by Patrick O’Donovan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae347ba8fd932e1103473f31e8a96c7174edb6aa/0_142_8824_5295/master/8824.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c303aef398a5680f897728161131622","title":"lifestyle club london members fees rights","story":"It was when Paolo Sanchez* needed to find affordable accommodation in London that he was lured by a Facebook ad offering a large, attractive room for a reasonable rate. Cleaning, utilities, broadband and council tax were thrown in. He applied, and moved into a eight-bedroom house-share in Hackney for £900 a month. Only then did he realise what he had let himself in for.“The agent can come and go without notice and make a judgment on how tidy it is and, if they don’t like it, can fine all the occupants,” he says. “Three times people have been in our property. Most worrying, they can terminate the contract at any point giving us seven days to move out.”The company, Lifestyle Club London, is a lettings agency calling itself a “membership club”. Those who sign up are, it claims, able to make the property they choose a principal residence for as long as they wish, or move between any other of its properties with 24 hours’ notice.Instead of a deposit, it requires a nonrefundable £200 joining fee and a refundable membership fee, worth one month’s rent, which is, essentially, a deposit. “Members” then pay a monthly rate. The company compares itself to gig-economy firms such as Airbnb and Uber, which skirt around the usual rules to offer flexibility.The catch is hidden in the terms and conditions, which make extraordinary reading. Tenants, or “members”, must maintain and replace white goods at their own expense and leave them in situ when they leave. If they require extra furniture they must pay half the cost and leave it for club use. Club staff are entitled to inspect rooms unannounced at any time and if “gross breaches” are identified the membership fee is withheld. “Gross breaches” can include the inevitable consequences of a large household. Sanchez, 22, and his eight housemates were fined £90 for leaving dirty dishes in the kitchen sink and £225 for removing graphic print-outs taped to the fridge warning of penalties for drug taking and dirty kitchens.“We’re struggling to understand our position,” he says. “They have the power to create new fines essentially from nothing, and when one of the housemates moved out, the club refused to return his £600 deposit. We fear they intend to do that with all of us.”Ever since the 1977 Protection from Eviction Act, landlords and lettings agents have sought ways around laws enshrining the rights of tenants. Many blur the legal distinction between “assured shorthold tenants”, who have exclusive rights to the accommodation and cannot be evicted without a court order, and “licensees” who typically occupy a hostel run by a registered social landlord, a holiday let or spare bedroom in a family home. They have fewer legal rights and can be evicted without a court order.Lifestyle Club London appears to be an example of a lettings agent exploiting a legal grey area. Set up last August by 30-year-old Estonian Tiina Lehtla with capital assets of just £1, it seeks to imply its “members” are licensees, rather than tenants. Its Companies House registration – Lifestyle Club LSC Ltd – says it operates “housing association” real estate. But it is not a registered housing association and its website invites private landlords to add properties to its portfolio.The penalties, right to unannounced access, “membership fee” and “monthly contributions” rather than rent create the impression residents do not have exclusive rights over the rooms they rent. At a stroke, this removes any of the rights of an assured shorthold tenancy, such as government-backed deposit protection and protection from eviction.According to Robert Bolwell, a specialist in landlord and tenant law with Dutton Gregory LLP: “Even if someone renting a room does not have a formal tenancy agreement, since Lifestyle Club LSC is not a registered social landlord, it is difficult to see how the company can avoid the provisions of the Protection from Eviction Act and simply terminate their right to accommodation. The courts have long said that one should not look at labels when determining the nature of a contract. If the arrangement looks like a tenancy and smells like a tenancy, you may well have a ‘tenancy’, no matter what a landlord decides to call the arrangement.”Lifestyle Club London trades from an address in the London borough of Islington. Last August, Islington trading standards successfully prosecuted a lettings agent, Green Live, for stating two of its tenants were “licensees” and refusing to register their deposits with a protected scheme, or allow them to challenge an eviction notice.In what is thought to be the first case of its kind in the country, the agent was fined £11,000 under the Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 for issuing two sham licences. Trading standards says it is aware of Lifestyle Club London, but declines to confirm whether it is investigating.Lifestyle Club London says that the flexibility it offers members outweighs what it admits are “disadvantages”. “It is true that under our agreements you are not under statutory protections, but on the other side you have much more flexibility.“You can upgrade, downgrade, move in and out or relocate between club properties on your own terms and with very short notice without having the liability of a tenancy agreement. We simply came up with a new concept which some might call questionable but, likewise, so could the practices of Airbnb and Uber.”It claims that members share properties with a resident landlord, which makes them licensees. Sanchez says there is not one in his house. Moreover, he says his requests to transfer to another club property have been stalled and there are no properties listed on the website or anywhere else, for “members” to choose from.According to housing charity Shelter, Sanchez’s predicament is symptomatic of an overheated property market and official inertia has left young people on tight budgets particularly vulnerable.Lifestyle Club London may not be breaking the law but mayor Sadiq Khan has committed to cracking down on lettings agents who do, last year releasing a “rogue landlord and agent checker” to name and shame private landlords and letting agents who have been prosecuted or fined.Legislation in 2014 made it mandatory for lettings agents and property management firms to register with an approved arbitration scheme. Lifestyle Club London directs complainants to the Shared Accommodation Providers Association, a dormant company whose phone number and email address are out of service.However, it’s also signed up to the officially approved Property Redress Scheme (PRS) which can expel members who do not comply with its rulings when a complaint is upheld. But it does not check their terms and conditions comply with its code of practice before accepting their membership. An expelled company can no longer trade legitimately.Sanchez and his housemates can complain to PRS, but ultimately their contract would have to be tested in court. As he says: “Lifestyle Club holds all the cards. I’m actually happy with the accommodation, but the instability is very worrying.“Many of us are students and to lose our home and a month’s rent would leave us struggling to survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9892a8fa059fb727ef63b67ad165ac18109899e9/0_2485_3648_2190/master/3648.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f250636f9f0ce162be1baed72bb37dc8","title":"populist voters less likely to trust news media european survey finds","story":"Pew says public views of media now ided more by populist leanings than left or rightEuropeans with populist views typically trust the news media much less than others and are far more critical of its coverage of key issues such as immigration, the economy and crime, according to a continent-wide survey.The study also found that in many – but not all – countries, people with populist attitudes are more likely to get their news from social media, and that as many as one-third of all adults pay no attention to the original source of articles they see there. Pew Research Centre polled more than 16,000 adults in eight western European countries. Those who said ordinary people would do a better job at solving the country’s problems than elected officials, and that politicians did not care what people like them thought, were identified as holding populist views.In seven of the eight countries surveyed, people with populist attitudes were also significantly less likely – by between 11 points (Denmark) and 24 points (Germany) – to say the news media were important to society.“In western Europe, public views of the news media are now ided more by populist leanings than by … whether someone identifies as politically on the left or the right,” the researchers said, adding that their survey provided a “consistent, cross-national measure of some of the fundamental tenets of populism”.Populism – the view that government must reflect “the will of the people” and that “the people” and “the elites” are two opposing groups – has made big inroads across western Europe in recent years, from the UK’s Brexit vote to the success of populist parties in elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany, Austria and Italy. On specific key issues, people with populist views in Spain were 33 points less likely to say the news media were covering the economy to their satisfaction, while those in Germany were 29 and 31 points less likely to be content with the way the issues of immigration and crime were handled.

Denmark, like New York, which followed its lead, has an outright ban. Big food companies elsewhere have been under intense pressure to use substitutes. The WHO is calling on all governments to take action, including passing laws or regulations to rid their food supply of industrial trans fats. Director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said eliminating trans fats would “represent a major victory in the global fight against cardiovascular disease”.The WHO is targeting industrially made trans fats, but trans fats are also contained in milk, butter and cheese derived from ruminants, mainly cows and sheep.Dr Francesco Branca, director of the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development at the WHO, said the amounts we eat in dairy products are unlikely to breach the health guidelines.“We are saying that trans fats contained in those products have the same effect as industrial trans fats – we are not able to tell the difference,” he said. “But the amount contained in dairy products is much less.”Walkers cheese and onion crispsVegetable oils (rapeseed, palm)\u0026nbspRapeseed oil is healthy, but palm oil is a highly saturated fat, widely used in industrially-produced foods because of its very low costWheat flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin) Added vitamins but this is finely milled white flourGlucose syrup\u0026nbspAnother form of sugar, made from maize in the USA, where it is called corn syrup, or from potatoes and wheatDextrose\u0026nbspAnother form of sugarVegetable fat (palm) Cheap form of saturated fatMaize starch\u0026nbspOften used as an anti-caking agent in sugarsEmulsifiers (mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, sorbitan monostearate, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, soya lecithin, polysorbate 60)\u0026nbspEmulsifiers are additives used to stabilise processed foodsTapioca starch\u0026nbspThickening agent derived from cassava rootsStabiliser (xanthan gum)\u0026nbspMade from fermented sugars.

National dietary surveys show that intakes have reduced since 2007 and the amount we are consuming is well below the recommended maximums for the UK. “If industrially produced trans fats are removed from foods this is positive, but if they are being replaced with saturated fats we would be concerned. We know that saturated fat consumption is in excess of UK guidelines and diets high in saturated fat are linked to raised cholesterol levels, a risk factor for heart and circulatory diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e101ee2c318fcb6b57ff77209e902ff1e0ba70fb/0_347_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c57e4c9a34fdfb78cb9abdd851b767c","title":"social housing funding system is nuts says top property developer","story":"Roger Madelin calls for higher corporation tax and says reliance on private developers to pay for affordable homes is stupidOne of the country’s top property developers has described the UK’s system of funding social housing as “nuts” and called for higher taxes to speed up building.Roger Madelin, a member of the executive committee at British Land, told the  the decades-old system of getting private developers to pay for affordable homes was “a stupid way of meeting this social need” and that the government should directly fund them.“All companies should pay higher corporation tax,” he said. “This country needs to have more tax paid. If we did it like that we could get on and do it. It can’t work in the long term, you can’t expect developers to continue to produce for the population’s social needs at this level. It should come from general taxation.”Madelin’s suggestion will raise eyebrows in the notoriously profit-driven property industry as it implies increased taxes on its profits. But he is a respected figure who led the regeneration of King’s Cross in London as well as Brindley place in Birmingham and his remarks reflect growing frustration that the system is not only failing to deliver enough cheap housing, it is also a drag on development.He made his proposal as British Land submitted one of the UK’s largest planning applications for a £3bn regeneration of Surrey Quays in east London, with 3,000 homes, up to six skyscrapers and several new corporate headquarters on a site stretching across 53 acres – similar in size to the regeneration of King’s Cross. It is located about a 20 minutes’ tube journey from the City of London, between Shoreditch and Peckham, two rapidly gentrifying areas, on the London overground line. Some 35,000 people already live in the Rotherhithe peninsula, where the development will take place.The total number built, including with state funding, fell from 61,090 in 2011 to 41,530 in 2017.Madelin believes that by avoiding the current haggling between council officers and developers about how much they should contribute to affordable homes, the government could regain control of how much and when much-needed affordable housing could be built.“I find it nonsensical that we go through these viability assessments,” he said. ‘If you have a shortage of cars then you wouldn’t get motor manufacturers to subsidise people who can’t afford a decent car.”The Surrey Quays site is at present occupied by swaths of surface car parking, a 1980s shopping centre and the disused Daily Mail printworks which is currently acting as a 3,000-capacity electronic dance music venue.The planning application features towers rising up to 46 storeys which will have striking views of the Shard, the City and Canary Wharf, all of which are within two miles. Canada Water, an enclosed former dock will be the centre of about 120 acres of open space which will feature walking trails including one, potentially, that winds up and over the exterior of a new entertainment venue. Madelin said he hoped to inspire people to engage in the Italian pastime of “passegiatta” – promenading, a pursuit not normally linked with the Rotherhithe peninsula."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/266cc48868797af0021a64acfbbd55339d86cc11/0_118_4370_2622/master/4370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef03c61cb59e770b9f647ee2450f8a8","title":"us citizens standing against poverty poor peoples campaign america uk","story":"The recent “McStrikes” in  the UK may not have involved a lot of people but they have symbolic importance. As the workers involved have pointed out, a £10 minimum wage demand is hardly asking the earth of\u0026nbspa highly profitable global company. However, on top of the issue of a living wage, the strikers’ sharp focus on zero-hour contracts is crucial. It’s a grim hallmark of the precarious jobs market that is inhabited by a growing chunk of the UK population 1.8m in 2017.Time and again we are told that “work pays” and is the best way out of poverty, when this is patently not the case. The emergence of the “gig economy” and a corresponding rise in self-employment breeds insecurity and low pay, leaving many in, or teetering on, the brink of destitution. Nevertheless, a range of actions that exposes poverty wages as an unacceptable new normal, along with the abject unfairness of vast pay gaps between bosses and workers and the injustice of spiralling corporate profits at the expense of fair pay, is to be embraced, such as a trade union-organised march on Saturday demanding a “new deal for working people” in the face of enduring low pay.In the US, the front lines of the fight against poverty pay and insecure work have been building up\u0026nbspa head of steam thanks to ongoing fair wage campaigns such as Fight for $15. Protests, including against McDonald’s, have become a regular occurrence. Most recently the unprecedented teacher walkouts in a number of states have captured national attention. Cuts to state education budgets and austerity have systematically stripped teaching professionals of anything resembling a living wage.On a broader level, attacks on Medicaid, the primary social insurance programme for the poor, have prompted pushback. Meanwhile, among the most impoverished people there is a\u0026nbspsteady forging of a different kind of protest movement, such as The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival (PPC). Spearheaded by secular and church grassroots poverty organisations, poor people themselves, and figureheads such as the Reverend William Barber (whose “Moral Mondays” initiative, inspired by Martin Luther King Jr, made headlines a few years ago when it mobilised record numbers of demonstrators in Raleigh, North Carolina, to protest against regressive state policies), the PPC is taking its message to the national stage.On Monday, after two years of preparation and grassroots coalition-building, the PPC kickstarts a\u0026nbspsocial justice effort with 40 days of peaceful direct action at state capitals around the US. The intention of the campaign is to construct a broad, citizen-led movement that challenges the shocking and avoidable scale of poverty and the systemic pillars that reinforce it, including racism. Thousands of people, including many who have\u0026nbspnever been activists, have signed up.A report, The Souls of Poor Folk, published last month by the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington\u0026nbspDC, in conjunction with the PPC, conducted an “audit” of poverty in America in the 50 years since Martin Luther King Jr launched his original PPC. The audit lays bare the enormity of poverty in modern America and meticulously documents inidual stories of hardship.Taken alongside rising levels of child poverty and austerity in the UK, there can be no doubt that if ever there was a moment for a concerted fight against poverty in two of the richest nations, this is it.• Mary O’Hara is author of Austerity Bites: A Journey to the Sharp End of Cuts in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2b5fc1bed0fa7d9f6a450fe5b29381b46b9e5d/0_438_5152_3090/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87c328468055216e94db26202eac541","title":"johanna konta knocks out rybarikova again italian open","story":"Johanna Konta is safely through to the second round of the Italian Open after beating Magdalena Rybarikova in straight sets.A week on from knocking Rybarikova out at the same stage of the Madrid Open, Konta claimed a 6-4, 6-3 victory over the 17th seed in one hour and 48 minutes.Konta had been due to play Petra Kvitova in Rome only for the Czech to pull out of the tournament after winning back-to-back titles in Prague and Madrid.

He will now turn his attentions to squad selection for the first Test against Pakistan a week on Thursday and meet up with new national selector Ed Smith on Tuesday.“When you come back to Yorkshire, you want to perform and give a bit back to the side. It’s been a little bit disappointing,” said Root, who led Yorkshire at the Oval owing to Gary Ballance’s illness. “But that’s cricket, it can be challenging. I didn’t come into these games to get ready for the Test matches. I made sure I did my preparation beforehand to try and perform well for Yorkshire. It’s just not materialised, unfortunately. That’s just how it can go.”Root and the Yorkshire coach, Andrew Gale, bemoaned missed opportunities in the field during the first day as the primary reason for their defeat, with the 20-year-old Pope nearly run out on the way to a career best 158 not out as Surrey recovered from 162 for six to post 414 on a pitch which offered help for the seamers all the way through. This was their second win from four matches.Alongside Pope, their other hero was the 19-year-old left-arm seamer Curran, who claimed six wickets in the first innings and finished with his first 10-wicket match haul – 10 for 101.Root said: “Their two young lads were very impressive. On a wicket that offered a bit, Ollie played really well. He has a good all round game and put our bowlers under pressure. Sam bowled nicely.

Sitting calmly in the wheels near the front of a large group full of big names, he waited until the finish line was a kilometre-and-a-half away. Then, with a quiet smoothness, he accelerated out of the bunch and simply glided away.Ahead lay only his team-mate Esteban Chaves, who had escaped with 25km to go. As he rode up to the Colombian, Yates knew he had done enough to put himself in the leader’s pink jersey. Crossing the line first would bring a bonus of 10 seconds, against six seconds for second place. With the end of the final stage in Rome still more than a fortnight away, those four seconds may turn out to be crucial.But then Yates did something remarkable. He dropped\u0026nbspback half a bike’s length, watching his team-mate take the stage win. The gesture showed he respected Chaves’s great effort, demonstrated he is\u0026nbspa team player and honoured the history and etiquette of his sport. At 25, he was showing a mature appreciation of the bigger picture.His second great moment came on Sunday, on another mountain. The Gran Sasso d’Italia dominates the Abruzzo region and again Yates found himself approaching the climax of an exhausting 225km stage in the company of the race’s big favourites. As the leading bunch surged towards the finish, Miguel Ángel López, Thibaud Pinot and Domenico Pozzovivo launched inidual attacks but on the last long left-hand bend Yates simply rode around them, sailing clear with the aplomb he had shown three days earlier. By taking the bonus he increased his lead to 32 seconds over Chaves and 38 over Tom Dumoulin, the defending champion, with Chris Froome, who struggled over the line in 23rd place, now almost two-and-a-half minutes in arrears in the overall classification.You could only wonder what certain other British riders were thinking as they watched Yates take his win with a calmness that suggested it was he, rather than Froome, who had several grand tour wins under his belt. Eight years ago Geraint Thomas, Ben Swift and Peter Kennaugh opted to join the new Team Sky programme, their hearts full of hope and ambition. Each is a talented racer and Thomas even held the yellow jersey for a few days at last year’s Tour de France. But he is 31, while Swift is 30 and Kennaugh 28. Thomas will support Froome at this year’s Tour while Swift is in his second season with UAE Abu Dhabi and Kennaugh his first with Bora-Hansgrohe.Yates, along with his twin brother, Adam, chose a different path. When their time to make a big call came five years ago, both opted to join an Australian team then called Orica-GreenEdge. The team are now known as Mitchelton-Scott and its sporting director, Matt White, has displayed the sort of confidence in the Yates brothers that Sky’s young riders, lining up to support first Bradley Wiggins and then Froome, or sidelined in favour of bigger names from Italy, Spain, Colombia and elsewhere, have never been granted.Born in Bury on August 7, 1992, nine days after Chris Boardman had laid down a marker for British cycling by winning gold in Barcelona, the Yates brothers followed their father into track cycling and became part of the Olympic development programme in Manchester. When Adam was not invited to take the next step with a place in British Cycling’s academy, he moved to France and spent three years riding for amateur clubs alongside future stars such as Pinot and Warren Barguil. Simon did get an invitation, which he accepted. In 2013, wearing British Cycling’s colours, he won two stages of the Tour de l’Avenir, an important race for promising young riders, and a stage of the Tour of Britain, beating Wiggins and Nairo Quintana to a hilltop finish on Dartmoor.Then came their biggest decision, which for Simon involved rejecting an overture from Sky. It was like a young player from Chelsea’s academy joining Liverpool or Spurs in the belief he would get regular games. Money didn’t come into it, he said he simply appreciated the programme the Australians were offering. It is a sign of the brothers’ shrewdness that, although they are close, they used different agents to negotiate their deals with the same team in case things did not work out for one of them.The last four seasons have been a story of careful development, with one notable blip when the team’s incorrect completion of a therapeutic use exemption form for an asthma inhaler during the 2016 Paris-Nice race brought Simon a four-month UCI ban for “non-intentional doping”. That year Adam won the white jersey for best young rider in the Tour de France, an achievement matched 12 months later by Simon.Now Simon is not just leading a grand tour but doing so with an air of utter confidence. Froome may yet discover his form before the 34km time trial which opens the race’s final week, in which the powerful Dumoulin represents an equal threat, but further huge mountain stages could give Yates the chance to make up for any time lost.With 2,000km still to cover before the race enters the gates of Rome, it’s a lot to ask. But if you’ve been watching him over the past few days, launching his attacks with lethal timing and a fluency that recalls the sport’s great stylists, you may not want to bet against the Giro celebrating its 101st edition with its first British winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f74118812682fb53f9ce4013c8f686810ae1f26/0_78_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feca8060c6257c4a34352244672d0151","title":"katy brand feminism generation divide theatre 3women play","story":"The actor and comedian explains how her debut play, 3Women, captures the age ide within feminism – and the defiance of the #MeToo eraI recently gave a talk at a girls’ high school. I mention this not only because I am a virtue-signalling monster but also because one of the young women asked something that brought me up short: “How should we react, as young feminists, to older women who don’t seem to support us?”I sat there and goldfished for a moment, keenly aware that these freshly minted teenage minds sat among their esteemed “older women” teachers. But this is one of the issues I have been grappling with in my debut play, 3Women, which is about three generations of the same family, aged 18, 40, and 65. They come together in an increasingly claustrophobic hotel suite the night before a wedding, ostensibly to enjoy some family bonding time. As more wine is ordered and drunk, the gloves come off, and there are old scores to settle.The drama and comedy of three women getting tipsy and having it out is immensely enjoyable and satisfying to write. But I also wanted the characters – Eleanor, Suzanne and Laurie – to talk about feminism, from a baby boomer’s proud memories of her suffragette grandmother, via the Generation X-era of self-knowledge, self-determination, therapy and healing, to now, with the millennials’ gender fluidity and their future facing dreams of artificial wombs and true equality for all permutations of humanity.So, in answer to the question regarding older women, my immediate response was: “Have a little empathy.” The women of Eleanor’s generation propelled feminism at an incredible pace through the postwar decades, and yet have not always been able to benefit personally and professionally in the ways I have, and those born after me. They were the architects of social change, but they couldn’t live in the house they built because they were still expected to conform to social stereotypes their mothers had to submit to. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be sometimes, even for the most generous of spirit. Let’s listen to those women. In fact, let’s all listen to each other, across the generations. We all have our stories to tell. If we fight, we can’t progress. And there are many vested interests in keeping us fighting.3Women is a play I have been wanting to write for several years, but as is often the way, other projects came up. I got pregnant and had a baby, and then there are all the other little pressures that life throws at you. Suddenly, last September, I had a strong desire to write it, and write it quickly. And the timing was right. Because the past year has been an immensely inspiring time for me, and for many other women. For the first time ever, I properly reported an incident of sexual harassment. I told a man in the street who demanded a smile that I didn’t feel like it at that precise second. I cut my own hair. (That was a mistake, in hindsight, and a nice man called Engin sorted it out for me. Thanks, Engin – you did what you could.)People keep asking me three things about 3Women. Is it autobiographical? (It’s not.) Is it part of the #MeToo movement? (It’s not about sexual assault, but I am very happy to be part of the broader tapestry of women finding their voices and using them, loudly.) What is the message? I’m not sure how I feel about messages in writing, and there are no thinly veiled agendas here. But there is a backlog of women’s stories to be told, and I am glad to be one of those with the opportunity to address the imbalance. Women don’t want to replace men – we just want equal airtime.But to do that, we must take ownership of our lives – and it’s never too late. In 3Women, all three characters are starting a new chapter – higher education, marriage, a move to another country – because they believe it will make them happy. And, amazingly, the pursuit of happiness is still considered brave, selfish, or even subversive, especially for women. But this is a moment for roaring, for taking what we want, not for being meek and mild. It shouldn’t be an act of courage to have the life you want. It should be easy. It should be normal. It doesn’t have to be this hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/275b2f8fdbad5de34f52278426cbe0c53f1d784d/533_685_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a5eb90b1954828cd6c8f8bf6a32242","title":"behind scenes baftas 2018 in pictures","story":"Photographer Sarah Lee joins the stars backstage at the Royal Festival Hall, London, for the Virgin TV British Academy Television Awards"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f99b206af4de1a1bc0c81a6b8980ccd6d3daa170/0_175_5241_3145/master/5241.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1edac75d5139483b4008f3c50770c4ee","title":"catalonia parliament elects hardline nationalist as president","story":"Pro-independence MP Quim Torra narrowly elected, paving way for end to rule by MadridThe Catalan parliament has narrowly elected a hardline secessionist as president, presaging the end of 199 days of direct rule from Madrid.Quim Torra, an uncompromisingly pro-independence MP who joined parliament six months ago, was elected by 66 votes to 65. The Spanish government argues that any referendum on Catalan independence would be illegal because the country’s 1978 constitution makes no provision for a vote on self-determination.The Spanish constitutional court, which has suspended the\u0026nbspreferendum law pushed through the Catalan parliament in September, is looking into whether the law breaches the constitution.In March this year, the\u0026nbspformer Catalan president Artur Mas was banned from holding public office\u0026nbspfor two years after being found guilty of disobeying the constitutional court by holding\u0026nbspa symbolic independence referendum three years ago.He is the first candidate to be approved by the body since Carles Puigdemont’s administration was sacked seven months ago, when the Spanish government used the constitution to assume control of Catalonia and call last December’s regional election. The Madrid government has said it will cease using article 155 of the constitution – which had never been invoked until last year – when a new Catalan government was in place.Torra is the anointed successor to Puigdemont, who has been in self-imposed exile since October, first in Brussels and now in Berlin, where he awaits the German court’s decision on Spain’s extradition request on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds.Puigdemont and the other politicians who have either fled abroad or been imprisoned were able to vote by proxy.Torra’s candidacy has been met with little enthusiasm and he only secured the simple majority required thanks to the anti-capitalist CUP (Popular Unity Candidacy) whose four MPs abstained despite Carles Riera, the party spokesman, describing Torra as a “neo-liberal capitalist”.Riera later said the CUP would not support Torra’s government because it was not “advocating disobedience and confrontation”.During his investiture speech, Torra said the true president is Puigdemont, who fled the country shortly after the unilateral declaration of independence last October. Puigdemont, who was re-elected in absentia in December, has indicated that he may call fresh elections within a year, so Torra may have a brief political shelf life.Torra offered dialogue while vowing to pursue the goals of the pro-independence minority and to make the republic declared in October a reality. “Defending the republic means defending every one of us,” he said.Speaking for the Republican Left party, Sergi Sabrià issued a call to work “on every democratic front, to expand the social base, the internationalisation of the cause, to mobilise in the street” and “to form a government to bring about the republic”.Sabrià thanked the new president for his willingness to achieve consensus and represent all Catalans, although Torra’s hostility to all things Spanish is a matter of record.Torra apologised for Tweets in which he described the Spanish people as shameless and capable only of exploitation. He had also said he did not understand why anyone in Catalonia would choose to speak Spanish.Responding to Torra’s investiture speech, Inés Arrimadas, the leader of the Citizens party, said: “The electoral law gives them a majority they don’t have at the ballot box,” adding that “fighting nationalism in 21st-century Europe isn’t an option, it’s an obligation”.Eva Granados, the Socialist party spokeswoman, described Torra as “a supremacist ultranationalist” who hates half of the population whom he intended to govern.Catalonia has been without its own government for seven months, so Monday’s decision represents the beginning of a return to normality. However, with a hardliner leading a secessionist coalition intent on pursuing the same goals that provoked Spain’s constitutional crisis, reconciliation between Madrid and Barcelona, or within what is now a deeply polarised Catalan society, looks as remote as ever.Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, is to meet the leader of the opposition Socialist party on Tuesday to discuss the Catalan situation.Rajoy has again hinted he could once again resort to using article 155 to impose direct rule if Torra tried to press ahead with independence.“I hope it will not become necessary again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db5b49762f13456e4cfc536386c1d3c71bb7807/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7799156f32a589d9929fc4df5285ee96","title":"cleric moqtadr al sadr who fought us takes surprise lead in iraq elections","story":"An Iraqi nationalist cleric who led two uprisings against US troops has taken a surprise lead in parliamentary elections, fending off Iran-backed rivals and the country’s incumbent prime minister, the electoral commission has said.The preliminary results are a severe setback for Abadi, who had entered the election campaign as the frontrunner.Sadr has a zealous following among the young, poor and dispossessed but had been sidelined by influential Iranian-backed figures.He will not become prime minister as he did not run in the election but his apparent victory puts him in a position to pick someone for the job. Winning the largest number of seats does not automatically guarantee that, however. The other winning blocs would have to agree on the nomination.Sadr and Amiri both came in first in four of the 10 provinces where votes were counted, but the cleric’s bloc won significantly more votes in the capital, Baghdad, which has the highest number of seats.Security and commission sources had earlier said Abadi was leading in the election, which was held on Saturday and is the first since the defeat of Islamic State in the country.The commission did not announce how many seats each bloc had gained and said it would do so after announcing the results from the remaining provinces. A document provided to Reuters by a candidate in Baghdad that was also circulating among journalists and analysts showed results from all 18 provinces. Reuters calculations based on the document showed Sadr had won the nationwide popular vote with more than 1.3m votes and gained 54 of parliament’s 329 seats. He was followed by Amiri with more than 1.2m votes, translating into 47 seats, and Abadi with more than 1m votes and 42 seats.Sadr is one of the few Shia leaders to have distanced himself from Iran and Tehran has publicly stated it would not allow his bloc to govern. He portrays himself as an Iraqi nationalist and last year met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who is staunchly opposed to Iran. In a 2010 election, vice-president Ayad Allawi’s group won the largest number of seats, albeit with a narrow margin, but he was blocked from becoming prime minister, for which he blamed Tehran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe1c0e4e173f2ac7e3428b93d99e5ce2dcded5a/43_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4787b184c02ea8bacc20e987b0205e4e","title":"is your boss secretly or not so secretly watching you","story":"From microchip implants to wristband trackers and sensors that can detect fatigue and depression, new technology is enabling employers to watch staff in more and more intrusive ways. How worried should we be?Last year an American company microchipped dozens of its workers. In a “chip party” that made headlines around the world, employees lined up to have a device the size of a grain of rice implanted under the skin between their thumb and forefinger. At first, Todd Westby, the CEO of Three Square Market, thought only about five or six people – him and a couple of directors, some of the people who worked in the IT department – would volunteer. But of the 90 people who work at the headquarters, 72 are now chipped Westby has a chip in each hand. They can be used to open security doors, log on to computers and make payments at the company’s vending machines.Can he see it taking off at lots of other companies? “Not necessarily,” he says. Or at least not yet. It’s partly a generational thing, he believes. “You may never want to be chipped but if you’re a millennial, you have no problems. They think it’s cool.” There are other uses for it – two months ago, the company (whose core business is selling vending machines and kiosks) started chipping people with dementia in Puerto Rico. If someone wanders off and gets lost, police can scan the chip “and they will know all their medical information, what drugs they can and can’t have, they’ll know their identity.” So far, Three Square Market has chipped 100 people, but plans to do 10,000.The company has just launched a mobile phone app that pairs the chip with the phone’s GPS, enabling the implantee’s location to be tracked. Last week, it started using it with people released from prison on probation, as a replacement for ankle tags, which Westby describes as “intimidating and degrading”. Could he ever see the company using GPS to track its chipped employees? “No,” he says. “There’s no reason to.”Not all firms would agree. Tech companies are coming up with ever more bizarre and intrusive ways to monitor workforces. Last week the Times reported that some Chinese companies are using sensors in helmets and hats to scan workers’ brainwaves and detect fatigue, stress and even emotions such as anger. It added that one electrical company uses brainwave scans to decide how many breaks workers get, and for how long. The technology is used on high-speed train drivers to “detect fatigue and attention loss”. While this sort of technology may have legitimate safety applications – a similar project was carried out with Crossrail workers using wristbands that sensed fatigue – it’s not hard to see how it could creep into other areas.In February, it was reported that Amazon had been granted patents for a wristband that not only tracked workers’ locations in the warehouse as they “picked” items to be dispatched, but could “read” their hand movements, buzzing or emitting a pulse to alert them when they were reaching for the wrong item. In the filing, Amazon describes it as being able to “monitor performance of the placing of the incoming inventory item into the identified storage location by the inventory system worker”.There are tech companies selling products that can take regular screenshots of employees’ work, monitor keystrokes and web usage, and even photograph them at their desks using their computers’ webcams. Working from home offers no protection, as all this can be done remotely. Software can monitor social media usage, analyse language or be installed on employees’ phones to monitor encrypted apps such as WhatsApp. Employees can be fitted with badges that not only track their location, but also monitor their tone of voice, how often they speak in meetings and who they speak to and for how long.Employees have always been watched at work, and technology has always been used to do it. But where it was once a factory foreman with a stopwatch, or workers having to physically clock in and out, now “all of that physical stuff has gone into digital technology”, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School. “It captures things that you weren’t able to capture in the past, like how many keystrokes are people taking, what are they looking at on their screen while they’re at work, what kind of language are they using. And surveillance follows you outside the workplace now.”How much of this is legal? In the UK, employers are allowed to monitor which websites you look at while at work, says Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law Solicitors who specialises in employment law. “However, the device they monitor must be partly or wholly provided by work. Employers must also give prior warning if they are going to monitor your online activity, and should make you aware of the relevant social media policy.” It is also legal to monitor keystrokes, though again employees must be told they will be watched. “In companies where this system is in place, it is not uncommon for employers to speak to employees if they feel that their number of keystrokes is low,” says Landau. “It is worth noting that a high number of keystrokes does not necessarily mean high levels of productivity and vice versa.”Employers could theoretically use your computer’s webcam to see when you’re at your desk but “there should be a justification for such monitoring, and you should be informed of it beforehand. You should also be informed what the pictures will be used for, and how they will be stored.” As for GPS tracking, “a company may track any vehicles that they supply to their staff. However, the data they collect must only be used for the management purposes of the company. Any GPS device is not allowed to be turned on if the employee is using the vehicle for personal reasons outside of work.”Amazon says its scanning devices “are common across the warehouse and logistics sector as well as in supermarkets, department stores and other businesses, and are designed to assist our people in performing their roles”, while the company “ensures all of its associates have easy access to toilet facilities, which are just a short walk from where they are working”. It adds: “Associates are allowed to use the toilet whenever needed. We do not monitor toilet breaks.”Some of Bloodworth’s colleagues, he says, were angry about the level of monitoring – “but it was more cynicism and resignation. Most of the people I met hadn’t been in the job very long or were looking for other jobs. Every job was temporary and it was a workforce completely in flux.” Has Bloodworth seen the future? Will we all be monitored like this by our bosses in years to come? Possibly, he says. “One of the things that has arisen in response to the book is that people say work is going to be automated anyway, or workers need to be more flexible, as if this is the way of the future and it’s inevitable, which I think is quite dangerous. Amazon can get away with this because of political choices and because the trade union movement is quite weak. I think other businesses will look at Amazon, see they have had success with this business model – and seek to replicate it.”For his book Working the Phones, Jamie Woodcock, a sociologist of work at the Oxford Internet Institute, spent six months working in a call centre. You get a sense of the monitoring, he says, “from the moment you walk in. You have TV screens that have everyone’s relative performance to each other displayed. Managers collect data on almost every single part of what you do. Every single phone call I ever made was digitally recorded and stored. In terms of monitoring, it’s like being able to call back every single thing somebody has made on an assembly line and retrospectively judge it for quality. We all make mistakes and we all have bad days, but this kind of monitoring can be made retrospectively to sack people and is used to give people a sense that they could lose their jobs at any moment.”Monitoring is built into many of the jobs that form the so-called “gig economy”. It’s not easy to object to the constant surveillance when you’re desperate for work. What has surprised Spicer is how willingly people in better-paid jobs have taken to it. “Prisoners in the past were forced to wear tracking bands but now we willingly put on step trackers or other kinds of tracking devices given to us by our employers, and in some cases we pay for the privilege.” Companies such as IBM, BP, Bank of America, Target and Barclays have offered their employees Fitbit activity trackers.It is part, Spicer says, of “this whole idea of wanting to improve or optimise yourself. A lot of technology is designed to not just feed back data about your performance to your boss, but also give it to you. I guess they’re also seen as cool or fashionable, so it’s not surprising they’re taken up so readily.”Spicer has watched the shift away from “monitoring something like emails to monitoring people’s bodies – the rise of bio-tracking basically. The monitoring of your vital signs, emotions, moods.” Of Three Square Market’s practice of chipping employees, he says: “You can imagine that slowly extending. You could imagine things like employers asking to have your DNA in the future, and other kinds of data.”Surveillance can have positive applications. It’s necessary (and legally required) in the financial industry to prevent insider trading. It could be used to prevent harassment and bullying, and to root out bias and discrimination. One interesting study last year monitored emails and productivity, and used sensors to track behaviour and interaction with management, and found that men and women behaved almost identically at work. The findings challenged the belief that the reason women are not promoted to senior levels is that they are less proactive or have fewer interactions with leaders, and simply need to “lean in”.Still, says, Woodcock, “we need to have a conversation in society about whether work should be somewhere that you’re surveilled”. That need is perhaps most urgent where low-paid, insecure jobs are concerned. “If you work in the gig economy, you have a smartphone,” Woodcock points out, and that smartphone can be used to track you. “I think because many of these workplaces don’t have traditional forms of organisation or trade unions, management are able to introduce these things with relatively little collective resistance.”The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is well aware of the issues of monitoring and data collection. James Farrar is the chair of its United Private Hire Drivers branch, and the Uber driver who won a legal battle against the company last year for drivers’ rights. “They do collect an awful lot of information,” he says. “One of the things they will report to you on a daily basis is how good your acceleration and braking has been. You get a rating. The question is: why are they collecting that information?” Uber also monitors “unusual movements” of the phone when someone is driving (implying it knows if someone is using their phone while at the wheel) and, of course, tracks cars and drivers by GPS.Not all surveillance is bad, says Farrar. In some ways, he would like more. He was assaulted by a passenger and is calling for CCTV in all vehicles, partly for the safety of drivers. “There is a role for surveillance technology,” he says. Ironically, when Farrar went for a meeting with Uber to discuss the assault, the company made him turn his phone off to prove he wasn’t recording it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9812a1109874366b030f7e2d3ff34ede1cabeb59/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838fd0df808bd610ab9e840f2c8f4475","title":"italy m5s five star movement league parties name prime minister","story":"Leaders will submit policy programme to president in which they are likely to take tougher stance on EUItaly’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and its far-right partner, the League, are preparing to present their government programme to President Sergio Mattarella on Monday and name a prime minister.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, and M5S counterpart Luigi Di Maio, worked over the weekend in Milan on a policy document in which they are expected to take a tougher approach towards illegal immigration and the EU.“If the rules, parameters and constraints imposed by Europe do not change, Italy suffocates.

Earlier in the day, the 31-year-old said the pair were “writing history” and needed time, but that talks had been positive.If Mattarella endorses the candidate, programme and cabinet lineup then he could nominate a prime minister on Monday, paving the way for a government to be sworn in this week before facing a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament. However, Mattarella warned over the weekend that he would not be a “pushover”. Di Maio and Salvini will meet in Rome on Monday before updating the president. It is still unclear who Italy’s next prime minister could be, although Di Maio said it would be “a politician and not a technician”.

But he specified the US government would not be pouring money into the North.While questions remain over whether US firms would want to pour money into North Korea given the many uncertainties, South Korean companies are far more eager to begin investment should sanctions be relaxed.Hyundai Group, a South Korean conglomerate, has set up a working group to explore how it can invest in the North while there have been numerous requests to the South Korean government about restarting the Kaesong industrial complex, according to local media reports. Kaesong was opened in 2004 and over 50,000 North Korea workers filled the site making goods for South Korean firms. The site lies just across the border in North Korea but was closed in 2016 after a nuclear test and rocket launch.Hyundai is also exploring restarting a tourist site at Mount Kumgang, which has been closed to foreigners since 2008 after a South Korean visitor was shot and killed by a North Korean soldier.“We are currently very discreet as nothing is certain, such as whether local or foreign businesses can open businesses there,” an unnamed Hyundai official told the Yonhap news agency. Efforts are being lead by the group’s chairwoman Hyun Jeong-Eun.Previous estimates by the South Korean government have stated it could cost as much as $500bn (£370bn) to rebuild the North’s moribund economy.South Korea and China would need to help Pyongyang establish policy and commercial banks, the South’s financial regulator said in a report on Monday. Outside help would be required to shore up confidence and minimise risk, it said.During last month’s historic Inter-Korean summit, South Korean president Moon Jae-in reportedly handed Kim a USB flash drive containing economic development plans. It included charts and videos detailing rail infrastructure and power plants that could be built if Pyongyang denuclearises. When Moon mentioned to Kim he hoped to travel to a famous mountain in North Korea, Kim made a rare admission about the dismal state of the country’s transport network. He said he would be embarrassed for Moon to make the journey, adding “our transportation, honestly, would be uncomfortable”. In the next breath he praised South Korea’s high speed rail network.

Donald Trump’s victory in US election in November 2016 put the fate of the deal in doubt. He had promised prior to his election to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran”, although many believed he might instead adopt a more rigorous implementation of the agreement and tighten sanctions already in place. This could force Tehran to violate first or make the deal redundant.\u0026nbspIn January, he reluctantly\u0026nbspwaived a raft of sanctions\u0026nbspagainst Iran as required by Congress every 120 days, but said “this is a last chance” and asked “European countries to join with the United States in fixing significant flaws in the deal”. The congressional deadline Trump faces this time is on 12 May, but he tweeted on Monday that he will\u0026nbspannounce his decision by Tuesday. Trump believes the agreement is a bad deal, which falls short of\u0026nbspaddressing Iran’s regional behaviouror its missile programme. He is emboldened by a group of Iran hawks in his inner circle, such as the\u0026nbspnational security adviser, John Bolton, and the\u0026nbspsecretary of state, Mike Pompeo.Offering himself as the spokesman of the Muslim Middle East, he also criticised Europe for not doing as much as Turkey to help 3.5 million Syrian refugees, adding the EU had never fulfilled its part of a refugee deal with Turkey by providing promised cash. Erdoğan was speaking at the thinktank Chatham House in London on the second day of a UK state visit. It has turned into part of his election campaign as a result of his decision to bring forward the date of the Turkish parliamentary and presidential elections by a year to 24 June.Theresa May, eyeing a post-Brexit free trade deal with Turkey, as well as security cooperation over returning foreign fighters, has taken a strategic bet on Turkey that has led to criticism of the Conservatives’ willingness to overlook Erdoğan’s increasingly authoritarian rule in pursuit of commercial agreements.Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat leader, picked out the environment secretary, Michael Gove, accusing him of “a fawning silence” over Erdoğan’s visit despite promising Brexit would give the UK a chance to promote human rights under the banner of “global Britain”. In his talks with May, Erdoğan indicated he was likely to press the UK to do more to hand over any exiles that he regarded as linked to the coup that nearly toppled his government in 2015.He said the US had forfeited its role as mediator in the Middle East and claimed the decision to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem “did not abide by international law or UN decisions”.He said: “America has chosen to be part of the problem and not the solution so they have lost their role as international mediator. We cannot stop feeling like being in dark days of pre-world war two.”He said he was compelled to point out that Iran had stuck to the terms of the deal reached in 2015 with Barack Obama, and it was vital that there was a continuum on such deals.selfish unilateral decisions being taken by the US administration. Erdoğan vowed he would continue to clear Syrian Kurds from his border after the Turkish capture of the Kurdish-held town of Afrin. He denounced US cooperation with Kurdish groups, saying the Kurdish Syrian YPD was trying to camouflage its Kurdish identity by joining with other forces in the fight against Islamic State. The British government is less willing to link the YPD with the Kurdish PKK forces fighting inside Turkey, but acknowledges there is a link. The UK ambassador to Turkey says action will be taken against any British person known to be fighting for the YPD.Although Erdoğan appears to have lessened his determination to see Bashar al-Assad removed, as part of his growing cooperation with Russia over Syria’s future, many of his remarks off the record suggest he still regards him as a mass murderer who cannot remain leader for long.He also called for the five permanent members of the UN security council to relinquish their role and to hand their seats over on a rotating basis to the broader membership from the general assembly. He claimed that Turkey was more democratic than many EU states."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3494453.1526283150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses in border area anxious over brexit impact on jobs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcern over recruitment post-Brexit was one  the key findings of an initiative undertaken to help inform a new strategy for health care staff in Northern Ireland. Photograph:  Lynne CameronPA WireHealth care staff in Northern Ireland are concerned about the ability to retain and hire EU colleagues post-Brexit, according to a survey published Monday.Nurses and doctors who live across the Border but currently work in the region are “anxious” and want reassurance, the findings of a workforce engagement exercise found.The feedback was among the key findings of an initiative undertaken to help inform a new strategy for health care staff in Northern Ireland.The plan to modernise workplace policies and procedures is designed to accompany the ongoing programme of reform of health service delivery in Northern Ireland.The Workforce Strategy 2026: Delivering for Our People, which was launched on Monday, has a stated ambition to address challenges with supply, recruitment and retention of staff.In regard to Brexit, one of the strategy’s objectives is: “Take account of and plan for the workforce implications arising from the UK’s exit from the EU and the subsequent implications for the EUEEA (European Economic Area) and non-EUEEA workforce.“The Department of Health strategy’s launch came as it was confirmed how £15 million of a £100 million pot already allocated for health service transformation in 201819 will be spent.Around £5 million will be directed towards the nursing, midwifery and Allied Health Professional workforce.This will include funding for 74 additional pre-registration nursing places, and 25 additional midwifery places, meaning a total of 1,000 nursing and midwifery training places are being commissioned from universities in 201819 — a total the department said represents an all-time high in Northern Ireland.More than 122,000 people work in health and social care in Northern Ireland, including the public, private and voluntary sectors. Around £2.3 billion a year is spent employing those who work in the public sector.Key targets outlined in the 2026 strategy include:- Explore and establish non-salary incentive programmes as a means of recruiting andor retaining people andor dealing with pressures in less popular specialties and locations.- Set up and roll out a regional health and social care careers service targeted at the existing workforce, young people from the age of 14, and possible returners to service.- Develop and integrate new ways of working and jobs across health and social care, and fund sustainable training and development programmes that meet service needs.Northern Ireland department of health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said: “This strategy recognises that we need to meet the challenge of making the Northern Ireland health and social care sector an employer of choice, by ensuring that the service is fully staffed, well-trained, and that workers can balance their work around the other commitments in their lives.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3493706.1526226410!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"drop in students choosing derry campus due to brexit uncertainty","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Nixon, vice-chancellor of Ulster University. Photograph: Nigel McDowellUlster UniversityThere has been a drop off in students selecting the Derry campus of Ulster University as their first preference for third-level studies, and a decline in job applications for posts there since the Brexit vote.Magee – as the university’s Derry campus is known – is Ireland’s only Border university.The most westerly of any UK campus and situated less than five miles from the Border with Donegal, almost 10 per cent of its more than 4,000 students and 20 per cent of its staff come from the Republic of Ireland. “Magee is a north west of the island campus as opposed to a Northern Ireland campus,” says Ulster University’s vice-chancellor and president, Professor Paddy Nixon. This is the philosophy behind much of Magee’s recent expansion. Ulster University’s long-planned graduate medical school, scheduled to open next year, will be the only such facility north of Galway, or west of Belfast. In February the university – along with the North West Regional College in Derry – signed a memorandum of understanding with Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the Donegal Education and Training Board to improve access to higher and further level education and training in what is increasingly referred to as the “North West City region”. The reality, says Nixon, is that Derry is a cross-Border city – and Brexit represents a huge challenge for both the city and its university, and its impact is already being felt. “During this uncertain period, we are seeing a drop off in a whole range of applications for jobs, requests for us to lead European grants, and students choosing us as a first preference,” he says. There are concerns over the continuation of research and other funding, and there has been a “significant exodus” of EU staff on fixed-term contracts. An associate head of school has already left to take up a position in Sligo another academic the university tried to recruit from the Republic turned down the post because of uncertainty over pensions, exchange rates, and concerns over the UK’s attitude towards Europe post-Brexit. “Our competitors are not actually the universities in the UK, they’re the universities in the South,” Nixon confirms. “100 miles down the road you’re in Galway or Dublin and the staff get good research funding and a good living and working environment. “We’ve got the same, but those universities remain in a European context. It’s a huge challenge for us.” While student numbers will not be affected – any vacant places will be filled by students from Northern Ireland – he is concerned the lack of ersity would be detrimental to the nature and identity of the Magee campus. “It wouldn’t be negative in terms of the finances of the university, but I think it would be negative in terms of the culture of the university.“For people who go through the Northern Ireland system, more often than not further and higher education is the first time it is a truly open and erse and culturally accepting space for everybody, and we as a university will always fight to maintain that.”Much of the difficulty for the university lies in the lack of clarity. “That’s the killer at the moment – we don’t have clear, unequivocal statements,” he points out. Brexit is one of the top two issues on the university’s risk register and its Brexit readiness group is at work preparing the university for all scenarios. The university has appealed for clarification regarding the future mobility of students and staff, for Erasmus students to be considered on an all-island basis, and for the introduction of post-study work visas for students – a measure which already exists in the Republic. “I would say we are no wiser than the day we got the result of the referendum vote. It’s limiting the ability of the universities in the UK, but particularly in Northern Ireland, to compete on a global basis.” This is exacerbated by the lack of political leadership in the North. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government for more than a year, since its Assembly at Stormont collapsed following a scandal over a botched renewable energy scheme. “At this point in time Northern Ireland is challenged because it doesn’t have that clear leadership in terms of an Executive, and we absolutely, unquestionably need that political leadership,” says Nixon. “I’m even more worried that there’s nobody in there lobbying for the best interests of Northern Ireland in this debate.”While Nixon is clear that the university was opposed to Brexit – it was among the signatories of a letter from UK universities stating that they wanted to remain in the EU – he is also concerned that the “vacuum of leadership” prevents Northern Ireland accessing any of the potential benefits of Brexit too. “If Brexit goes ahead then Northern Ireland is uniquely placed to be perhaps a halfway house between the EU and the UK, and there are some opportunities in terms of economic or inward investment that could flow from that,” he says. In the longer term he is not convinced it will have a significant effect on the university except that “we’re part of a global community and – real or perceived – there’s an isolationist piece to this Brexit debate, and if we are perceived to be isolating ourselves from a global research community then it will be significantly detrimental to us. “But at this point, it’s all guesswork.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

The helicopter will have twin, counter-rotating blades which will power through the thin Martian atmosphere at almost 3,000 rpm – about 10 times the rate of a helicopter on Earth.The helicopter has solar cells to charge its lithium-ion batteries, and a heating mechanism to keep it warm through the cold Martian nights.“The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet. The atmosphere of Mars is only one per cent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it’s already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet up,” said Mimi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager.“To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.”Controllers on Earth will command the Mars Helicopter, through a system of commands send from the ground, rather than a real-time joystick.The full 30-day flight test campaign will include up to five flights of incrementally farther flight distances, up to a few hundred meters, and longer durations as long as 90 seconds. On its first flight, the helicopter will make a short vertical climb to 10 feet, where it will hover for about 30 seconds.Please review our commenting policyAt least 41 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in Gaza protests as US opens Jerusalem embassyRoyal body language: how Harry and Meghan manage to be private in a very public spacePrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVRich List: Jim Ratcliffe named as UK\u0026#39s richest man and record number of women among 1,000 wealthiestSpanish police unit attacked by gang with baseball bats amid warnings of rising drugs \u0026#39mafia\u0026#39 in Bay of GibraltarRoyal Wedding flowers: what will Meghan Markle have in her bouquet?Who is Meghan Markle?

She inherited her position and stake in the company from her father Freddy Heineken when he died in 2002.She appears on the list alongside her husband, Citigroup banker Michel, 73, with a fortune of £11.1bn, up £1.8bn on last year. Her rise to the title of wealthiest woman in The Sunday Times Rich List has been attributed in part to the successful launch of a new alcohol-free beer.Topping the list this year is British-born industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, whose fortune stands at £21.05bn.Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, 63, who runs the family Heineken beer businessThe 65-year-old, who is chairman and CEO of Ineos - Britain’s largest privately-owned company - bought a box in the Royal Albert Hall for a record £2.76m last year.Mr Ratcliffe is now worth £21.5bn, up from £15.3bn last year, which The Sunday Times says is mostly due to the newspaper having greater detail about the businessman\u0027s assets, adding £50m for two superyachts, hotel interests in The New Forest and a large property portfolio.Ineos sells more than 60m tons of chemicals annually for use in the packaging, food, construction, textile, white goods, and car manufacturing industries, employing over 18,500 staff.Jim Ratcliffe: the billionaire who wants to arrest Britain\u0026#039s manufacturing declineIneos\u0027s director Andy Currie and finance director John Reece shared in his fortunes, joining Mr Ratcliffe in the top 20, taking joint 16th place with fortunes of £7 billion each.The number of people who inherited their wealth has gone down, with 94 per cent of the rich list being comprised of self-made entrepreneurs.  Financier Ernesto Bertarelli and his wife Kirsty saw the biggest decrease in wealth, losing £1.48 billion due to falls in Ernesto\u0027s pharmaceutical company stakes, the list\u0027s author said.Among others whose fortunes have declined is Jamie Oliver, who no longer appears on the list, having closed a number of restaurants in the past year.Jamie Oliver is no longer on the listArcadia boss Sir Philip Green’s fortune has also dropped in wake of the collapse of BHS and a row over its pension schemes after he sold the business for just a £1 to a man twice declared bankrupt.Falling sales at his flagship brands Topshop and Miss Selfridge as well as his promise to contribute £363 million towards the pension deficit led to Sir Philip\u0027s fortune dropping by £787 million to £2 billion.At second place in the list were the Hinduja brothers, Sri and Gopi, worth £20.64 billion. Their fortune jumped by £4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year.British-American industrialist-turned-media mogul Sir Len Blavatnik came in third place with £15.26 billion to his name.Jim Ratcliffe was at 18 on the list last year, but the compilers said this was down to the success of Ineos and the availibility of further detail on the business. Some of his wealth is in the form of two superyachts, hotel interests in The New Forest and a property portfolio.Mr Ratcliffe made his money in the chemicals industry as the founder of Ineos Group. He remains its chief executive  majority owner. His firm is currently locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking. The Hinduja brothers were first last yearThe Hinduja brothers have dropped one place after topping the list last year. But their fortune still jumped by £4.44 billion on 2017, with their India-based car manufacturer Ashok Leyland and Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank having a particularly successful year.The Hinduja group has investments in oil and gas, IT, energy, media, banking, property and healthcare.Sir Len Blavatnik, 60, was knighted this year for services to philanthropy. His recent donations include £50 million to fund the Tate Modern\u0027s new wing, and £5 million towards the Victoria and Albert Museum\u0027s new entrance, as well as funding the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University.He was second in the list last year. Sir Len made his money when he sold his stake in Russian oil company TNK-BP and as owner of Warner Music, as well as through investments. Simon (L) and David Reuben are brothersDropping one place form last year, brothers David and Simon Reuben made their money from property, metals and online business. They were born in Mumbai and raised in Britain. Lakshmi Mittal is chairman of ArcelorMittalAlso down one place is the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. He is chairman and CEO of the world\u0027s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal. He was born in India and lives in London.The highest-placed woman on the list, Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, and her husband Michel owe their fortunte to the Heineken beer dynasty.They have gone up the list, from 10th place last year.Granddaughter of the founder of Tetra Pak, Kirsten Rausing and brother Jorn own packaging company TetraLaval. They were in eighth position on 2017\u0027s rich list.Alisher Usmanov made his money in mining and investment. He has a stake in iron ore and steel giant Metalloinvest. He drops three places from fifth last year.The Irish-Canadian Weston family owe their fortune to the food and retail industry. They run supermarkets in Canada and also own a number of shops including department store Selfridges. The family were seventh in last year\u0027s list. Hugh Grosvenor, 27, is the country\u0027s youngest billionaire. He inherited the title of 7th Duke of Westminster when his father died two years ago.

He said this was a worrying development as health care workers are known as amplification factors for such outbreaks.The WHO said that $18 million (£13.25m) is needed for a three-month operation to fight the disease. It has released $2.6m from its own contingency fund, while the UK Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust have donated £3 million..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}This is not a licensed product and there are a lot of complications with using an experimental vaccinePeter Salama, WHO deputy director-generalDr Salama confirmed that for the first time during an outbreak of the disease a vaccine will be rolled out – it was approved for use during a smaller outbreak of the disease in DRC last year but was not used.Trials of the vaccine in December 2016 showed that it provides a high level of protection against a strain of the deadly disease. However, Dr Salama stressed that this is an experimental vaccine.This is not a licensed product and there are a lot of complications with using an experimental vaccine which requires to be kept in the long term at between minus 60 and minus 80 degrees celsius. So this is not a simple logistical effort, he said.WHO is desperate to avoid a repeat of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11,000 people.The agency, which was accused of being slow to respond in 2014, is working with the Congolese ministry of health to gather and test samples, conduct contact tracing and improve data collection and management. They are conducting a retrospective analysis of the chain of transmission to better understand the outbreak.Are we prepared for the next Ebola-scale epidemic?The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba, a remote part of the country, two to three days travel from the capital.The World Food Programme has put in place an air-bridge between Kinshasa, Mbandaka, the provincial capital and affected areas, with flights six days a week to deliver supplies and personnel.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the affected area, Bikoro in the north west of the country, at the weekend and praised the Congolese government\u0027s efforts.Ebola is one of the world\u0027s most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for bushmeat.The virus is handed on through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. After an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.It is DRC\u0027s ninth known outbreak of the disease since 1976, when it was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Royal body language: how Harry and Meghan manage to be private in a very public spaceAt least 41 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in Gaza protests as US opens Jerusalem embassyPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVRich List: Jim Ratcliffe named as UK\u0026#39s richest man and record number of women among 1,000 wealthiestSpanish police unit attacked by gang with baseball bats amid warnings of rising drugs \u0026#39mafia\u0026#39 in Bay of GibraltarRoyal Wedding flowers: what will Meghan Markle have in her bouquet?Who is Meghan Markle?

It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm and the public will have the opportunity to watch the Royal wedding from their sofas at home.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal body language: how Harry and Meghan manage to be private in a very public spaceAt least 41 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in Gaza protests as US opens Jerusalem embassyPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVRich List: Jim Ratcliffe named as UK\u0026#39s richest man and record number of women among 1,000 wealthiestSpanish police unit attacked by gang with baseball bats amid warnings of rising drugs \u0026#39mafia\u0026#39 in Bay of GibraltarRoyal Wedding flowers: what will Meghan Markle have in her bouquet?Who is Meghan Markle?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.There, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeMeghan\u0027s father will meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door, before walking her down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleAt least 41 Palestinians killed by Israeli troops in Gaza protests as US opens Jerusalem embassyRoyal body language: how Harry and Meghan manage to be private in a very public spacePrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVRich List: Jim Ratcliffe named as UK\u0026#39s richest man and record number of women among 1,000 wealthiestSpanish police unit attacked by gang with baseball bats amid warnings of rising drugs \u0026#39mafia\u0026#39 in Bay of GibraltarRoyal Wedding flowers: what will Meghan Markle have in her bouquet?Who is Meghan Markle?

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter. Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Balakrishnan brainwashed the cult into thinking he had God-like powers and that he could read their minds, as a means of subjecting them to years of abuse.politan Policewords by Hardeep Matharu Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan. Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In fact, the strangeness of our own universe might better be explained by an undiscovered natural law, they said.The idea of the multiverse comes about because in physics terms, our universe is very lucky to exist at all.Scientists launch huge survey to find alien lifeCurrent theories predict there should be much more dark energy inside of our own universe than there is. That is a problem because adding more dark energy would lead it to expand so quickly that any matter would be diluted before it could form the stars or planets that we need to live.In response to that, some have suggested that we might in fact be living inside of a multiverse. There are in fact lots of different universes – many of which will have more dark energy and so could not host life – and we simply live inside one that worked out in the right way.But the new study suggests that we might have been overstating how lucky we are. It might actually be possible for stars and planets to form even if there is much more dark energy.“We asked ourselves how much dark energy can there be before life is impossible?” said Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia. ”Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise. Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe.”It is still true that our universe could be very special. But it does not need to be quite so special, the researchers showed.“The multiverse was previously thought to explain the observed value of dark energy as a lottery – we have a lucky ticket and live in the Universe that forms beautiful galaxies which permit life as we know it,” said Luke Barnes, a John Templeton research fellow at Western Sydney University.“Our work shows that our ticket seems a little too lucky, so to speak. It’s more special than it needs to be for life. This is a problem for the multiverse a puzzle remains.”That puzzling fact might suggest that the multiverse theory is not true in the first place. The study does not rule out the idea but does suggest that the small amount of dark energy in our universe would be better explained by a law of nature that we do not yet know about.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It doesn’t exist.”He said maintaining a seamless frontier was about more than just trade, saying: “If you talk to people about their memories of the past, in the context of the border, you will often end up talking to someone with tears in their eyes.”The customs partnership plan will be examined by Mr Gove and fellow Brexiteer opponent Liam Fox, in a group also including David Lidington, a May loyalist.Meanwhile, two sceptics, Greg Clark and Karen Bradley, will examine the tech-based “max-fac” proposal – requiring border checks – with supporter David Davis.The set-up suggests neither group will reach a decision in favour, unless one member can be “turned”.Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, said: “We are in a farcical situation. Nearly two years after the referendum the cabinet is fighting over two customs options neither of which frankly is workable, neither of which is acceptable to the EU.”He rejected accusations that Labour’s stance was similarly muddled, arguing it backed a “comprehensive customs union” and a “strong single market relationship that hard wires the benefits”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just as we seem set on leaving the EU, we start advising others to join. Government policy would not look out of place in the theatre of the absurd.”Mr Brake said of foreign secretary Boris Johnson: “This just shows how incompetent Boris is.

This goes beyond party politics - it’s more important than party politics.”The House of Lords voted to make keeping the UK inside the European Economic Area (EEA), and therefore the single market, a negotiating priority – throwing the decision back to MPs.But Labour remains opposed, while vowing to negotiate a “strong single market relationship that hardwires the benefits”, without explaining how that will be possible outside the trading bloc.Mr Miliband was speaking ahead of sharing a platform with Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary, and Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The trio are warning that Britain is being “held to ransom” by hardline Tories hell-bent on a hard Brexit, in the starkest evidence yet that party allegiances are breaking down as battle rages over departure from the EU.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Miliband dismissed chatter about a new centrist party, saying his campaign was pushing for “cross-party working, not for creating a new party”.Bitter cabinet splits made it a “national crisis”, he warned, adding: “The UK has no negotiating position on the fundamental issues that face the country as it contemplates its post-Brexit relationship with the European Union.”Britain to ‘lose influence’ in global security operations after BrexitMay faces deadlock over Brexit customs rules as both options rubbishedMay urges public to \u0027trust me\u0027 to deliver Brexit amid cabinet rowsEU set to push for six-month extension to Brexit transition periodNurses from EU face annual £600 fee for own NHS costs after BrexitHe predicted an “enormous sigh of relief in Europe” if Britain stayed in the single market, because the EU “don’t want a weakened Britain, because that think it will weaken Europe”.The so-called “Norway option” was now “on the table”, after that country’s prime minister made clear it would welcome the UK staying in the EEA.Mr Miliband, who runs a UN charity in New York, said he was also seeing at close quarters how America, under Donald Trump, was turning away from Europe. “We have to take that into account,” he said.And he rejected Brexiteer protests that revolts in parliament weakened Britain’s negotiating hand, arguing: “What’s more destructive for a government position than having no position?”The three prominent politicians are calling on MPs to stand up to “the hardest of Brexits”, which they characterise as “a fantasy island” of “economic pain” and diminished standing.“Over the coming months, MPs will have the chance to table amendments to bills - and vote for those amendments - which can prevent the country from suffering the long-term damage that a hard Brexit will cause,” they wrote at the weekend.“The pro-Brexit press will angrily protest, but what is the role of MPs if not to improve and protect the lives of their constituents?”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Scott might be 26 years her junior but he always strikes me as the “older” one in the relationship.It’s that sheer zest for life that Barbara has, even at 80, that makes this diagnosis so very sad and hard to bear.Scott decided to speak out because he felt he could no longer protect his beloved wife from people outside their close circle of friends and family hearing the truth.He became worried her illness would make her do or say something out of ­character that could upset her and others.He wants to be able to take his wife on ­ outings, and for her to still meet the public who love her and who will now ­hopefully understand if she’s having a “foggy” day.Scott also needs to make sure he takes care of himself and doesn’t get completely worn out looking after his wife.He hasn’t been able to leave her alone in the house recently, but now the truth is out he can let others take over while he at least has half an hour to himself.Anyone who cares for someone with dementia knows it is utterly exhausting, stressful and worrying, no matter how much you love them.I salute everyone who quietly and patiently deals with these day-to-day ­struggles. Scott is now free of the burden of keeping the secret and I hope he is finding strength from all of the messages of support for Barbara.She’s been part of many of our most-loved shows and we’ve grown up with “Our Babs”.I remember watching her wiggle and giggle her way through the Carry On films, where her sheer talent and perfect comic timing marked her out as a little superstar.Who could forget her enthusiastic arm flinging exercise routine in Carry On Camping that ended with her bra pinging off?And that incredible bikini made up of three shiny red hearts in Carry On Again Doctor made my pal Dr Hilary Jones decide to take up a career in medicine.As she more than proved during her reign in EastEnders, Barbara has always been so much more than a bubbly blonde dolly bird.She is one hell of an actress and was in her element behind the bar of The Queen Vic.It was her and Scott’s decision to kill off Peggy Mitchell when her memory began to fade.Barbara was having difficulty ­learning lines so felt she couldn’t give her very best performance.As it so happens, the scenes leading up to her character’s death were some of the best that ­Barbara, or any soap actress, has ever given on the small screen. Quite simply she is the real deal.I’ve been lucky enough to ­interview her many times over the years and it’s like catching up with an old friend.She’s open and honest and has never tried to cover up her ­mistakes or to sugar-coat the ups and downs of her life.When work was thin on the ground she painted on a smile, climbed into her shiny fairy godmother outfit and worked her backside off in provincial pantos.She was always quick to credit EastEnders for giving her a career comeback.I’ve seen her talking to fans outside the ­studio, always happy to pose for pictures, sign autographs and have a chat.She would leave everyone with a smile on their face and some happy memories.Her own powers of recall and her very bright light may be diminishing, but Scott and all her friends and family, and the public who adore her, will ensure she is wrapped in a soft blanket of love.She’s a class act and a very special woman.TAKE a bow Shayne Ward and all concerned with the deeply moving and hugely important storyline of Aidan’s suicide in Coronation Street.The subject was handled with great sensitivity.We saw Aidan feeling isolated and alone in the crowded Rovers, witnessed his fearful despair and heard his father’s anguished screams of grief through the closed bedroom door.There was no need to see his cold, dead body to understand what had happened. This really was Corrie at its finest.Richard Hawley as devastated dad Johnny and Catherine Tyldesley as poor bereaved Eva were exceptional, but what made me really blub was the authentic speech by Gail (Helen Worth) looking out of her window on to the iconic cobbled street, talking about how we all need to look after each other and that no one should suffer in silence.It was beautifully written and impeccably delivered.That’s what Corrie is all about.IT’S the one time of the year when our inevitable failure to win a massive trophy in Europe is a source of fun and amusement rather than humiliation. Because tonight is Eurovision.Our plucky Brit doomed to failure this time is SuRie, above, who is actually a good performer with a perfectly acceptable song, but even if the UK entry was Robbie Williams belting out Angels, we would still be near the bottom of the table or even doomed to the dreaded “nul points”.Many theories are put forward for our dire results over the past two decades.Some believe there are too many countries taking part (Australia and Israel are bizarrely considered part of Europe) which makes for more tactical voting, combined with an anti- British backlash made worse by Brexit.I reckon it’s simply because we don’t take it seriously enough, for which I’m very grateful, because I truly love Eurovision.We know we won’t win so it’s just an excuse for a party, a chance to wallow in the whole wonderful campfest and to chortle at Graham Norton’s snarky comments.My perfect evening.WHEN Kim Kardashian is the most elegant and tastefully dressed woman in the room, you know that something has gone horribly awry.So it was at the ludicrous Met Gala in New York, which saw a procession of show-offs dressing up like extras from the Monty Python sketch about the Spanish Inquisition.Madonna looked like Dracula’s mad old aunty, Sarah Jessica Parker had a nativity scene on her head, and don’t get me started on Rihanna, who came as some sort of sexy bishop mashed up with a pearly queen.It made Kim’s skin-tight gold sheath Versace dress appear to be the epitome of class.We are told the Pope approved this farrago, which was pompously entitled Heavenly Bodies: Fashion And The Catholic Imagination.His endorsement should make you shudder – until you realise that’s how he always dresses.He’s also a man with a passion for red leather Prada slip-ons, so I suppose he is more connected to the weird world of fashion than your average parish priest.A great deal of money is raised for good causes at this tacky celebration of fame and fortune, and that’s all well and good. But maybe next year they should stay at home and write a cheque.One thing is certain. You can be darned sure they won’t follow up the Catholic theme by making a mockery of Islam or Judaism.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it would take a brave man indeed to risk homophobic abuse from the stands and on social media.A few rugby players have found such courage. So has top rugby ref Nigel Owens. We suspect the vast majority of football fans wouldn’t bat an eyelid.They may even be hugely supportive.Clubs could operate zero tolerance towards anyone abusing a gay player.The first to come out would be a standard-bearer for others. And football could finally catch up with the sea-change in attitudes of the last 30 years.It is “a modern institution nothing like the rest of society”, according to the lover of the anonymous star on our front page.It’s time that changed.IT may come as a shock to the shrieking Left but most Brits back grammar schools and would happily send their kids to one.As indeed would many left-wing hypocrites currently moaning about them.Most people also believe they are good for social mobility. Which they are.The Sun is all for more grammar ­places so long as a generous proportion are guaranteed for children from low-income families — as they will be.We back more choice, smaller classes and higher standards. So does the nation.DONALD Trump has been given the usual kicking over Iran — but he may be right.Barack Obama’s dodgy deal freed the mullahs to spend billions spreading war and terrorism throughout Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza.Trump aims to halt that and punish the extremist regime. Who knows . . . maybe Iran’s people will finally revolt.Trump’s aggression and rash tweets have surprising upsides. He has helped propel North Korea towards peace.That’s more than Obama achieved during eight years of sonorous speeches which disguised dithering timidity.WHAT a surprise. A rabidly left-wing UN “racism inspector” sent to “find out” if Britain is more racist since the Brexit vote has decided — wait for it — we ARE!Her bogus “report” is a load of pre-meditated and vacuous bilge designed to bash ­Britain and the Leave vote.It must have irritated Tendayi Achiume to have to leave her home in the Californian sunshine for the charade of a 12-day UK tour amassing “evidence”.Here’s an idea, though.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson.

It was highly planned. The bodies have never been found.” But despite experts’ observations, the Malaysian government, which has signed a “no cure, no fee” deal with Texas-based company Ocean Infinity to resume the hunt for the plane, remains silent on the question of Zaharie’s possible involvement.Ocean Infinity started the search on January 22 this year, following a failed £111million search for the plane.  At the time, experts said they expected to have answers within a matter of weeks.The company has 90 search days to look for the plane, which has been spread over several months. Officials said there was roughly an 85 per cent chance of finding traces of the wreckage in a new 15,000 square mile search area.The investigation is expected to end in mid-June but those on the TV show said they feared MH370 may never be found."},{"url":null,"title":"chiefs sack dad snapchat prank","story":"Alun Rees, from Rhondda in Wales, posted a series of clips on his Facebook page and joked that his supervisors were lazy.In his most recent video, he posed as someone applying for a job and the company boss using two different Snapchat filters.He pretended to offer someone a supervisor role and was told you havent got to do anything and you havent got to keep your eyes open all day.At the time he worked for a construction company for almost two years and was building two power stations at an EDF Energy site in Bridgwater.But the video went viral and he was ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and had his pass to the Hinkley Point C site taken away three days later.The former bulldozer operator started his most-recent video – which was viewed 100,000 times – by pretending to be a potential future employee.He was reading a job advert in a newspaper which said: “Urgent workers needed, no experience necessary.”Mr Rees, a father of twin one-year-old boys, then offered the person three jobs – including a supervisor role.He said: “You haven’t got to do anything, you haven’t got to keep your eyes open all day and there’s absolutely no learning involved whatsoever.“You get a Land Rover, lovely nice healthy wage, more than all the operators, and, best of all, you get a shiny blue helmet.”But Mr Rees told Wales Online that he was encouraged by his colleagues – and even his supervisors – to make more videos because “everyone on the site loved them”.He said: “It was a bit of fun, everyone was telling me to keep making them and egging me on because it boosted morale, even the supervisors.“I didn’t mean to upset anybody, I was just having a laugh and everybody on site loved them.“I had a friendly warning on the Wednesday and was told to take it down and I did immediately.“I agreed to go to a disciplinary meeting the next day with my union rep and they admitted it was light-hearted and gave me no indication that there would be serious action taken.“After being told not to do it again, they asked me to get the video up on my phone so they could watch and have a laugh before going back to their desks.“I left work on the Friday for the Bank Holiday weekend and just by chance I checked my emails on Saturday and there was a dismissal email.

I couldnt quite believe it.I had a sit down and have a cup of coffee afterwards but am still in a bit of a daze now.Anne, a widow, said she intends to spend some of the money on her two children and four grandchildren and have a family celebration. She will also give some to charity.Jeanette May, of Eastbourne Auctions, said: The vendor came in with these glass finger bowls and said she had a broken vase in the back of her car that she was taking to a charity shop.Our assistant went out and saw it rattling around on the back seat and said oh thats nice. He knew it was good but didnt realise just how good.It had a big chunk missing out of the rim and a large hairline crack down it.But it was made for the Emperor Qinglong and is obviously very rare.We are chuffed to bits for our client.We try and get people to come in with their items to sell but the things they dont think are worth any money are just as important."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405985265.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hawaii kilauea volcano fissure lava","story":"Residents of the Puna District were told to evacuate over the weekend by officials who warned of a possible major eruption at the volcanos summit.Hawaii County Civil Defence issued an emergency cellphone alert after the fissure - a split in the earth - was discovered early Sunday morning, threatening one of the worlds most active volcanoes to erupt.The agency said one unidentified structure was destroyed by the new vent, bringing the total number of homes and other buildings lost to lava in the area to nearly 40.Residents in the immediate area were told to evacuate and two nearby community centres were serving as shelters for people and pets.Lava spread across hundreds of yards of private land and loud explosions rocked the neighbourhood not far from Leilani Estates subdivision, where more than a dozen other active vents have opened in the past week.Nearby resident Richard Schott, 34, sat near a police checkpoint and watched as the eruption churned.He said: Ive actually seen rocks fly over the tree line and I can feel it in my body. Its like a nuclear reaction or something.The new opening was still showing signs of activity Sunday afternoon.The fissure measures about 1,000 feet in length.The US Geological Surveys Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said new fissures, ground deformation and abundant volcanic gases indicate eruptions on the eastern flank of Kilauea are likely to continue.USGS scientist Steve Brantley said: The appearance of the fissures in the past couple of days does not change the overall picture or concern.Christian and Maritza Ricks, who moved to the area from California in April, stopped on the side of the road to watch and listen to the latest eruption.Ricks said: I guess its just part of living on the island.He said he wasnt really afraid of the destruction happening around him.In a way its kind of exciting to see whats going on and be this close to it.Most of the lava outbreaks have occurred in and around the Leilani Estates neighbourhood, where molten rock has burst through the ground, destroying more than two dozen homes and resulting in evacuation orders for nearly 2,000 people.The US Geological Survey has reported nearly 20 active fissures.One that opened Saturday night was spattering, but no flow had formed.The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported the fissures opened just east of the Puna Geothermal Venture energy conversion plant, where steam and hot liquid are brought up through underground wells and the steam feeds a turbine generator to produce electricity.Plant workers last week as a precaution removed 189,265 litres of a flammable gas stored at the site.Geologists warn that Kilaueas summit could have an explosive steam eruption that would hurl huge rocks and ash miles into the sky."},{"url":null,"title":"sydney harbour bridge man caught filming woman selfie stick","story":"Named only as Angelica, the 25-year-old was exercising in her luxury waterfront apartment in Sydney, Australia, when she noticed the phone on her balcony peering up from the property below.The device belonged to Phillip Manwarring, 47, who claims he was simply checking the brickwork of the building which he shared with his neighbour, reports the Daily .Father-of-two Phillip had attached the phone to a selfie stick which he then strapped to a wooden pole using tape.Angelica was working out in sportswear when she saw the camera out of the corner of her eye on May 2.She said: “I was shocked to see this and jumped up, grabbed my shirt off the lounge and hid behind a wall where I thought the smartphone might not be able to see me while I put my shirt back on.”Lawyer Phillip insists the dispute over the brickwork has been ongoing since 2016 and relates to a botched renovation.He claims he has asked his neighbour 19 times for permission to gain access to her flat to complete the building work.Phillip says that the property is deteriorating because of the delay in fixing the problem.The 47-year-old insists the filming of the brickwork was supervised by his own engineers and builders.He says the footage “only shows the walls of the property.”Four days after the filming incident, Angelica moved to her family’s new home in the Sydney suburb of Henley only to spot Philips car parked outside.She told police: “I dont know how Manwarring would know where I live in Henley.”The lawyer claims he only drove past the family home to ask about the proposed renovations.Police have launched an investigation into the matter and both parties have moved out of the luxury apartment building in the Kirribilli area of the city."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406065906.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"first day work blunders","story":"A poll of almost 3,000 workers revealed almost half have made a bad first impression after having a terrible or humiliating start to a new job.Others arrived to find they were completely over-dressed, spilled tea everywhere, got lost en route to the office and said something inappropriate because they were nervous.But 95 per cent feel it’s important to make a good first impression on others when starting a new job, with 82 per cent believing they’re more likely to make a positive impact on their first day if they know they’ve got their clothing spot on.The study was commissioned by 4imprint, as part of its ‘First Impressions’ campaign, having recently released a new range of corporate clothing to help UK organisations and their employees create a strong and lasting impression.A spokesperson for 4imprint, said: “Starting a new job can be intimidating for a variety of reasons.“From not knowing who you’ll be working with, not being 100 per cent sure how to get to your new workplace and worries over what to wear can make for a nerve-wracking first day.“Our study found the importance of what you wear to work can make you feel as comfortable as possible on a first day and help create a great first impression.”Turning up wildly over or even under-dressed was among the mistakes new workers do on a first day, with more than seven in 10 wishing they had a uniform for work, in a bid to make their first day – and consequently first impressions – easier to manage.Other first-day nightmares to appear in the top 30 list include finding there was no allocated desk or computer to work at and being late due to nasty traffic.Having a wardrobe malfunction and accidentally sending a sensitive email as a ‘staff all’ also feature in the list.Meanwhile, one in three British workers have been introduced to someone on day one at work, then immediately forgotten their name.One fifth have also been so nervous they’ve ended up blurting out something inappropriate or stupid - leading to quizzical looks from colleagues.Others have accidentally damaged company property, been over-friendly and had to ask how to turn the computer on.But researchers found those who excelled on their first day put it down to being fully prepared and sufficiently knowledgeable about the company.And when it comes to making a good impression, 58 per cent say arriving early works wonders while 57 per cent try to ask intelligent questions.The spokesperson for 4imprint added: “A decision can be made about a person within 26 seconds of meeting them – which is why appearance is so important.“Corporate work wear can provide reassurance to new starters and if your organisation operates in the service or retail sector then staff uniforms can also be vitally important for customers.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406086635.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sydney double lottery winner jackpot","story":"The Sydney man

They will help you feel calm and happy.“Read a book, play on your computer, Xbox, PlayStation, play a board game, watch some films whatever you enjoy doing most, try and find some time to do that before Monday.The weather for the weekend looks good. Get yourself outside for a game of football, cricket or whatever sport your enjoy.“Go for a walk or run, climb a tree anything that will get your heart pumping a little.“Remember that exercise lowers your stress levels, makes you feel happy and more alert.He went on to put the SATs results into perspective and told they children he wanted them to do as well as they could.Mr Frost continued: The results you get will not change how wonderful you are, how much family and friends love you or what you are capable of in the future.”Ending the letter he said: Remember that SATs do not test the following qualities: compassion, creativity, happiness, love, generosity, confidence, kindness, faith, bravery and many more things that are far more important in life than long division and adverbial phrases.Parents said that they had sat down with their children and read the letter out together with their children in an age when most communication with schools was online.A similar positive thinking exercise was carried out at the Lakeside Primary School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.Lakeside’s reassuring letter, send out earlier last week, read: Next week you will sit your SATs tests for maths, reading, spelling, grammar and punctuation. We know how hard you have worked, but there is something very important you must know….The SATs tests do not assess all of what makes each of you exceptional and unique. The people who create these tests and score them do not know each of you the way that we do and certainly not in the way your families do.They do not know that some of you speak two languages or that you love to draw and paint. They have not seen your natural talent for acting or playing the ukulele. They do not know that you have entered story writing competitions or street dance competitions.They do not know that you have represented our school at Young Voices. They do not know that your friends can count on you to be there for them, that your laughter can brighten the darkest day or that your face turns red when you feel shy.They do not know that you participate in the school football team, the school netball team or the school cross country team.They do not know that you are obsessed with Harry Potter or Michael Rosen or flossing. They do not know that you wonder about your future, or sometimes help your brother or sister.They do not know that you are kind, trustworthy and thoughtful and that every day you try to be your very best.The outcomes you will get from these tests will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything. There are many ways of being smart. You are smart!

By eagerly shooting down the United Kingdom, this one-man rogue state is a serious threat to our peace and prosperity. The Brextremists who once pretended there was the prospect of the greatest trade deal ever no longer kid perhaps even themselves. Tantrum Trump champions not America but Donald First, as we carry on seeing the fallout from a reality TV star hijacking the US Presidency. Offering him tea with the Queen at Windsor and a round of golf with dumb Prince “Airmiles” Andy at Turnberry in July is the modern equivalent of handing Danegeld to an invader. With his unilateral withdrawal from the successful Iran no-nukes deal signed by Britain, Grim Reaper Trump has demonstrated that he does not give a damn. His decision to risk war with Iran follows a pattern of bad behaviour: threatening punishing import taxes pouring acid rain on a climate change treaty ignoring allies to shift the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.  It is compelling evidence of why Britain is stronger in the European Union than as an isolated target of this loose cannon in America. As the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan candidly conceded, Brexit is not going as well as he and his fellow quitters had expected. Jobs are at stake and slippery Michael Gove is just the latest Cabinet Minister to humiliate Theresa May as she struggles to negotiate with the Conservative Party let alone with the rest of Europe.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a provocative statement in which he praised Israeli soldiers and called Jerusalem the eternal, undivided capital of Israel.  Israeli forces have killed at least 41 Palestinians along the Gaza border, health officials said, while some 900 Palestinians were wounded, about 450 of them by live bullets. It is the highest Palestinian death toll in a single day since a series of protests dubbed the Great March of Return began at the border with Israel on March 30, and since the 2014 Gaza war. Tens of thousands streamed to the coastal enclave\u0027s land border on Monday, some approaching the Israeli fence - a line Israeli leaders said Palestinians would not be allowed to breach. Clouds of black smoke from tyres set alight by demonstrators rose in the air.  Trump, who broke with other nations by moving the US HQ from Tel Aviv, made a speech via video from 5,000 miles away in the White House.  In an address he said: Congratulations it\u0027s been a long time coming.  He continued: Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every sovereign nature to determine it\u0027s own capital.  Mr Trump said: The United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement, Trump said. The United States will always be a great friend of Israel and a partner in the cause of freedom and peace. Trump said that the US had “failed to acknowledge the obvious” for many years, adding that “today, we follow through on this recognition.” He also said he was “extending a hand of friendship to Israel, the Palestinians and to all of their neighbors.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in lockstep with Trump over fulfilling a long-standing U.S. promise to move the embassy to the holy city and over Washington\u0027s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last week, echoed the sentiment. What a moving day for the people of Israel and the State of Israel, Netanyahu said. He paid tribute to our brave soldiers who are protecting the borders of Israel today. and said that it was a great day for peace  A peace built on lies will crash on the rocks  The capital of the Jewish people, the capital of the Jewish state.  He thanked the US President saying: President Trump by recognising history you have made history.  Ivanka Trump unveiled the US seal on the consulate in Jerusalem which has been extended to make the new embassy.   Jared Kushner, the US envoy to the Middle East , told the invited guests: When President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it, Kushner said at the embassy\u0027s opening ceremony.  Today also demonstrates American leadership. By moving our embassy to Jerusalem, we have shown the world once again that the United States can be trusted, he said. We stand with our friends and our allies, and above all else, we\u0027ve shown that the United States of America will do what\u0027s right, he said.  Despite the US President staying away, there is a massive security operation in place amid fears of a terror attack. More than 100,000 Palestinians are expected to demonstrate inside Gaza.

Fit and active Curt Rimmington was left shocked when he received the devastating diagnosis after suffering seizures. The 25-year-old, from Colchester, Essex, is being supported by his girlfriend, Laura Sullivan, who is now providing for both of them while he goes through treatment.  Curt\u0027s family told Essex Live he tried to claim benefits to help with their expenses, but was stunned when he was told he didn\u0027t qualify because he was out of the country for so long.  They have launched a fundraiser to help the young couple through the difficult time.  Curt\u0027s younger brother Jack, 19, said: Curt is not entitled to benefits because he was travelling outside of the country for two years even though he had paid national insurance from the age of 16 until he went travelling. He is living with his partner Laura and she is having to provide for both of them and Curt does not receive any support or benefits. The donations that we receive will go towards their general living costs and also additional treatment. Curt had worked in the UK as a vehicle technician from an apprenticeship at the age of 16 until he left the country to travel the world in 2014.  While abroad he worked with bricklayers and in demolition in Sydney, Australia, along with time working on a banana farm in Queensland. Two years later, he returned to Colchester and began working in construction and fencing. Then, in September 2017, he suffered a seizure in his sleep that would later lead towards the discovery of a brain tumour during an MRI scan in hospital. He was initially told that that the tumour was not believed to be cancerous, although several seizures followed in the months after the operation and Curt was then required to undergo open brain surgery in February of this year. Doctors attempted to remove as much of the tumour as possible, but found that the tumour was intertwined with parts of the brain and it limited how much of the tumour could be removed. Tests were done on the samples taken from the brain and it was found to be stage three cancer.

Terrifying footage shows huge flames rising high from the cars which were parked in front of their home in Sea Mills, Bristol. A dad-of-two, who asked not to be named, described how his family were woken by two loud explosions at around 2.30am on May 6. They then recorded the dramatic footage while they waited for the fire service to arrive. Looking out of their bedroom window in Bowerleaze, they realised the noise had come from their Toyota Verso and Hyundai i10 which was already engulfed in flames.  Firefighters called to the emergency confirmed the incident was likely to be arson. The family believe the apparent attack could be linked to similar incidents which have happened in the area over the last year.  The dad-of-two told Bristol Live : “We were woken by the explosions which we think were either the airbags, windows or tyres because both cars were already on fire.  “The fire was coming from the front of the car - the engine - even though they had been parked on the drive for five or six hours already.  “We rang 999 straight away and got the children out of their beds away from the front of the house and the fire engine arrived about 15 minutes later,” he said. They were told the fire was probably caused by arson and to ring the police the next day. “Something needs to happen before someone gets killed. It isn’t too much of a leap to think that the fire could’ve caught on the house and then who knows what may have happened, he added. The family suspect the cars were ignited purposely with a firework, which would match a number of recent incidents, in nearby areas. “There seems to be an epidemic,” said the dad.

Hannah Gilbert said she suddenly transformed into a different person for three weeks every month from the age of 14. She said her brother and sister were scared of her and her behaviour became so bad when she got to 16 that her exasperated family kicked her out. When she moved back a year later, she had an explosive row with her dad and the day after he had a heart and died - something she blamed herself for for years. But Hannah has only been given an official diagnosis for her condition in recent years. Few people know about PMDD - pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder but it affects one in 20 women in Britain. Only one in 50 are diagnosed with the condition despite its ability to ruin lives.  During her heartbreaking battle with the disorder she said she tried to take her life on more than one occasion and she left her husband Sam \u0027feeling like he\u0027s walking on eggshells\u0027. Writing in the Bristol Post , Hannah explained how PMDD has affected her life in her own words...   Writing this, telling my story, has to be one of the hardest things. I want you to know that whatever happens you are not alone, and just because I’m writing this, it doesn’t mean you will have it, but there maybe a possibility, and that’s ok. Pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder is an illness that effects one in 20 women in the UK. Thirty per cent of women in the world have it, 15 per cent of women who suffer, end up self-harming or committing suicide and sadly only two per cent of women get diagnosed. It’s not just about my periods. It is so much more - I wish it was PMS and \u0027Aunt Flow\u0027, out-staying her welcome! It turns out, PMDD sufferers have an anomaly in their gene activity that triggers more sensitivity to estrogen and progesterone, which leads to more intense pre-menstrual symptoms. My symptoms are so severe it stops me having a normal life. There is no worse feeling than living a life, feeling normal, then one day when your body changes and you first start your journey into womanhood, you get robbed. You\u0027re robbed of an experience because you are suddenly hit with so many emotions: Intense anger for no reason, depression and extreme anxiety, insomnia and vivid dreams. You feel that you have stepped into the pages of Jekyll and Hyde, that you are now living this life. You become two people: The normal you that pops up for only one week of a month, this person then hides away in the shadows of the other one - that hormonal b***h that you wish would go away, the one you can’t control and don’t understand why all this has happened. I want you to know that I understand, I will be there and I will support you. I spent most of my periods in the school nurse\u0027s office, crying in pain from the severe cramps and feeling like a freak. I used to pour my heart out to my mum, saying I hated who I was becoming.  I used to pray to God to end my suffering because the pain was unbearable. My brother and sister were afraid of me, they never knew when I would lose my temper and have an episode. I loathed who I was for three weeks of the month. I went to the doctor\u0027s crying for help and my mum came along for support. I was told it was just behavioural and that I would grow out of it. My schooling became effected, but my mum and dad never gave up: They made sure I had tutors to help me, so I could have an education. When I was 16, I was thrown out of my home, I was too dangerous and my moods to unpredictable. Homeless, I moved in with friends. I sofa surfed until a year later, I moved back home. Then on March 16, 2004, I had a huge episode and had a massive argument with my dad. He died the next day from a heart attack and I never got to say sorry, I blamed myself for many years for his death. I was left feeling so dark in myself and that there was something wrong with me and had no hope. I made a few attempts on my life, I self-harmed and I couldn’t stand the weight I would pile on, so I developed an eating disorder. My family and my friends helped me through a lot of this over the years. I never truly spoke about what was going on. How could I say, \u0027for one week I’m normal and then I feel for three weeks that I really can’t function and have no control\u0027? I’m at my worst a week before and after my period. I just sounded crazy and like I was picking and choosing when I was going to be unwell. For years I went backwards and forwards to my doctor, I was given all diagnoses, no medication was effective and I gave up hope with medical professionals. But she said she felt a huge change when she met her husband Sam. We have been on and off for many years. I’m very lucky as most women I meet who have PMDD have failed relationships. He is very patient, but we do have our problems - our relationship has been pushed a lot because of me. He has always known it wasn’t me, but felt that there is two people in our relationship: He loves me but hates the other one. He has told me he struggles and feels that he is always walking on egg-shells, afraid that whatever he says can trigger me. Over the years, I found ways of coping, throwing myself into work and my hobbies. I loved crafting and needed a creative outlet.  It’s horrible to feel that the people closest to you are the ones that are the worst affected. This was most tested when I had my first child Austin. For so many years I put off having children, mainly fear of birth and fear of me. I was once told labour is like your worst period pain, times that by ten. If my pains were anything to go by, no thank you. Sam also spoke to me about feeling scared of what I might have been like pregnant. The craziest thing happened though when I was pregnant. For the first time in 15 years, I felt normal throughout my pregnancy and for the first six months after having my son. Sam told everyone we meet: \u0027she hasn’t been crazy, she has been so normal!\u0027 It all stopped when I stopped breast-feeding and my periods came back. Trouble really came knocking. My periods didn’t come back like before I had Austin. No, they came back like when I was 14. The depression, feeling so hopeless and manic was scary. Worse, when you are a first time mum and you want to protect your child, but how do you protect them from you? Especially when you are their mum? There is no baby books that can explain me, my baby and my hormones. There was no help. The doctors tried labelling me with postnatal depression. The health visitor was advising me I was depressed. I wanted to pull my hair out and scream. The love I had for my son, I knew there was no way I was depressed, I had so much love for Austin and the connection I had. It broke me to think otherwise. I did question myself and I began to crumble very rapidly. Not being listened to, or people not having the answers because of lack of awareness, is the most detrimental thing when you have PMDD. On one of my darkest days, I found an article about PMDD. It was me, it was how I felt. The only people who listened to me, was Sam, my mum and an extremely supportive manager at work. Through their support I went about getting help. I went back to my doctors, but they dismissed what I was saying and said it was mental health and I was depressed. In the end I paid privately. I saw a wonderful consultant - she knew instantly that it was PMDD and got me on Evorel patches, twice a week. She suggested that I tried the chemical coil, and changed my diet, no more carbs and sugar.

The dress reportedly cost \u0026pound9,000 at the time, and featured puffed sleeves and more then 10,000 pearls.  Speaking during ITV\u0027s Invitation to the Royal Wedding, Elizabeth admitted being horrified when she saw how creased Diana\u0027s dress had become. She said: We did know it would crease a bit but when I saw her arrive at St Paul\u0027s and we saw the creasing I actually felt faint. I was horrified, really, because it was quite a lot of creasing.  It was a lot more than we thought. They had done a dress rehearsal but using a different material, and it wasn\u0027t anywhere near as bad. But she now says that looking back, that moment was actually her favourite shot of the Princess in the dress, comparing it to a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon and becoming a butterfly.

And now, a secret shopper has found out just how much cheaper Aldi is than its supermarket rivals - from Asda and Tesco to Waitrose. The discount store swept the board in the High Street supermarket price survey this week, based on a trolley of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items. Its shopping basket was more than \u0026pound4 cheaper than its nearest rival in the survey - Asda - according to a report published yesterday. The price difference highlights a reason behind the proposed merger between Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s, which was announced last month.  The stores have come under growing pressure from many Brits switching to discounters like Aldi and Lidl to save money on their weekly shop. Trade magazine The Grocer carries out a weekly mystery shopping basket survey checking the prices of 33 \u0027everyday\u0027 items at the five major supermarket chains - but this week added Aldi as a guest retailer. It found that while Aldi shoppers paid \u0026pound33.14 for their basket of goods, customers at nearest rival Asda paid \u0026pound4.41 more, at \u0026pound37.55. Sainsbury\u0027s was ranked next at \u0026pound39.51 - which was \u0026pound6.37 more expensive than Aldi - followed by Tesco, Morrisons and Waitrose.  The Grocer said: Guest retailer Aldi claimed a convincing win over its traditional supermarket rivals this week - and in doing so illustrated one of the key reasons why Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s feel the need to merge. Aldi\u0027s \u0026pound33.14 total was \u0026pound4.41 cheaper than Asda, helped by offering the lowest price for 27 of the 33 items on our list. Twenty three of these were exclusively cheaper than any of its rivals. This makes Asda 13.3 per cent more expensive and while the gap has closed from 16.5 per cent in January, drastic measures appear to be needed if Asda is to genuinely close the price gap to the discounters.  It added: Hence the Sainsbury\u0027s merger - should a post-deal Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s live up to their promise to cut many everyday prices by 10 per cent, Asda in particular would start to look a lot more competitive. Sainsbury\u0027s, which last week also invested \u0026pound35 million in reducing the price of selected meat and fish products, actually managed to grab third spot this week. Although at \u0026pound39.51 it was \u0026pound6.37 and 19.2 per cent more expensive than Aldi. Tesco was 21.5 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound40.70, a difference of \u0026pound7.56. As our shopping list was heavily weighted towards own label, Tesco\u0027s Brand Guarantee scheme had little impact on the final standings. Our shopper had 45p taken off her bill at the checkout which still left it \u0026pound7.11 more expensive than Aldi.  Morrisons was over 25 per cent more expensive than Aldi at \u0026pound41.68. In the case of sixth-placed Waitrose the difference was even greater - the \u0026pound14.86 difference on its \u0026pound48 basket makes it 44.8 per cent more expensive. Waitrose also had just two products on deal. This compared with Asda\u0027s nine, Aldi\u0027s eight, Morrisons\u0027 six and four each at Sainsbury\u0027s and Tesco.

People across the UK will be digging out their flip flops, sunglasses and shorts again as they enjoy a glorious burst of warmth and sun after the weekend washout. Forecasters say summer-like conditions are expected to make a comeback over the next couple of days, banishing the cool and unsettled westerly airflow that kept the mercury subdued over the weekend. They predict the best of the warm weather will be in the south-east, where locals and tourists in the capital could bask in 22C heat. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE THE FORECAST FOR YOUR AREA       In comparison, 20C highs are expected on the holiday hotspot Ibiza - while 17C temperatures and showers are predicted in the Italian capital. Figures will linger around the high teens and low 20s for the rest of the UK. Today, temperatures will rise sharply, reaching highs of 19C widely - even in parts of Scotland - as high pressure lures a welcome brief burst of warmth and sunshine from south-west Europe, according to forecasters. Values are expected to continue to rise into tomorrow, with temperatures predicted to soar up to 4-8C above average for the time of year. Eleanor Bell, principal meteorologist of The Weather Channel , said almost all of the country will enjoy drier, brighter and warmer climates today.  However, a north-south weather divide will mean clearer skies and sunny spells will be replaced by scattered showers in Scotland and north-west England by tomorrow afternoon. She added: High pressure is expected to build early next week with warmer air from the south- west mixing in. This along with increasing sunshine will allow temperatures to lift above normal. Maximum temperatures will be around 16-18C on Monday, lifting to 18-22C on Tuesday. But it will be cooler over the north-west, 13-17C, with more in the way of cloud and showers there. According to the Met Office, parts of the south-east could see 23C highs tomorrow, with the best temperatures likely around Southampton.  And looking ahead to the weekend, it is thought Prince Harry, 33, and actress Meghan Markle, 36, will also enjoy sunshine as they tie the knot. Met Office forecaster Alex Burkill said: “The week ahead will see a lot of fine weather from Monday, and that is likely to continue for the royal wedding. “Early indications are for Saturday in Windsor to be dry and bright with highs around 18C, a touch above the 17C average. “This Tuesday could see 25C in the South, before highs return to normal on Wednesday and then edge upwards again on Saturday.” Below, you can find out the forecast for your area for today and tomorrow. North East England Although this morning may have been chilly, most people in the North East are set to enjoy warm weather by this afternoon. The sunshine will be largely unbroken and the conditions will be dry, with maximum temperatures of around 18C.  But the Met Office warns: Some mist may encroach onto coasts later in the day, together with cooling coastal breezes. Tomorrow, it will be warm inland with long sunny periods, but coastal areas could see cooler conditions with fog patches. Some places are set to enjoy 19C highs. North West England This region will see plenty of warm sunshine throughout today, with a light wind and largely cloud-free skies, the Met Office says. Temperatures of up to 20C are expected. Tomorrow morning will also see warm sunshine, but cloud and a few spots of rain could arrive for some later in the day. Again, the area could enjoy highs of 20C.  West Midlands Those in the West Midlands can expect glorious weather today - with sunshine, warm temperatures and barely a cloud in the sky. The Met Office says: After a chilly start to the day, plenty of warm sunshine will develop. The wind will be light and there will barely be a cloud in the sky into the afternoon and evening. Temperatures could hit 21C - and tomorrow is set to be even warmer. The weather service adds: Tuesday will start cold, however there will be some unbroken warm sunshine through the day. For some cloud will build into the afternoon but it will stay dry. Maximum temperature 22 \u0026degC. Yorkshire and Humber Like other areas, Yorkshire and Humber will have seen a rather chilly start. But this afternoon, it will be warm in most areas with dry conditions and largely unbroken sunshine, forecasters say.   The region could see highs of 20C, but some mist and cooling coastal breezes could encroach onto coasts later today. Tomorrow is also expected to be warm and sunny, with temperatures as high as 21C. However, there could be light winds. East Midlands The forecast here is similar to that of Yorkshire and Humber - it will be warm for many inland areas with largely unbroken sunshine. Conditions are also expected to be dry, forecasters say. Temperatures could reach 20C - potentially soaring to 22C by tomorrow. The Met Office says it will also be warm inland tomorrow, but low cloud, fog patches and cooler conditions may occasionally affect coasts. It adds: Then cloudier overnight with patchy rain, and becoming breezy.  Wales People in Wales can expect to enjoy plenty of warm sunshine today, with temperatures as high as 20C. The wind will be light, but we could see some patches of low cloud in the far west, the Met Office predicts. It adds that there will also be warm sunshine tomorrow, with largely cloud-free skies - although the coast will be cooler. Temperatures of up to 21C are expected. London and South East England Western areas are set to enjoy warm, sunny weather today - as temperatures soar to 21C (and a staggering 23C by tomorrow). The Met Office says: Becoming warm for western areas by the afternoon, often sunny, and most places dry, but perhaps cloudier here later.   Generally cloudy in eastern counties, with cooling breezes across Kent coasts and hills, and a few spots of drizzle possible. It adds that, tomorrow, most areas will be warm and sunny by the afternoon, with the best temperatures likely around Southampton. South West England Again, despite a chilly start, this region will see plenty of warm sunshine today. However, the Met Office warns it will be cooler in the far west. Highs of 19C are expected. Tomorrow is also set to be warm and sunny, with largely cloud-free skies. But areas on the coast could see cloud and cooler conditions. Temperatures could soar to 20C, forecasters predict.  East England It will be warm, sunny and mostly dry in the west today, forecasters say. However, the conditions in eastern counties will be generally cloudy with cooling breezes, coastal mist, fog and a few spots of drizzle. The region will see maximum temperatures of around 19C. Tomorrow, low cloud, fog patches and cooler conditions will become confined to coasts, according to the Met Office. Many inland areas will be warm and sunny by the afternoon. Temperatures could hit 20C. Northern Ireland After a cloudy morning, Northern Ireland is expected to see a little afternoon sunshine, with warmer weather and light winds. The area could see highs of 18C today. Tomorrow, it is set to be a dry start with bright spells in the east. The afternoon will be dry and bright in some places, forecasters say. Unlike other areas, a lower high has been predicted for tomorrow - 17C. Scotland Most parts will experience a dry, sunny and warm day, forecasters say. Those in Edinburgh can expect to see plenty of sunshine - with temperatures set to soar to as high as 19C. Tomorrow is also expected to start off dry and sunny, although some areas of the country could see cloudy, damp weather throughout the day.

But how do you celebrate the exciting occasion if you\u0027re a budding baker? By making a life-size cake of the happy couple - obviously. Lara Mason spent 250 hours making the incredible cake, and the final result is extremely realistic. It could feed 500 people and was made using 300 eggs, 15kg of flour, 15kg of butter and 15kg of sugar.  To decorate and to hold the whole thing together, she needed more than 10kg of buttercream, 20kg of modelling chocolate and 50kg of fondant icing. Speaking to , Lara said: It really has been a labour of love but I\u0027m so please and so proud of myself It\u0027s the tallest cake I\u0027ve ever made. Annoyingly, Prince Harry is 6ft 2 so it had to be 6ft 2. But you don\u0027t know until you try. Every time I test myself and push my boundaries I learn something new.  We think the cake looks incredible, but the biggest test was when she showed it off to her one-year-old twin daughters Lily and Lyla. She said: Lyla reached her arms out to try and give him a hug, so she must have thought he was a real person. That was the final nod because she wasn\u0027t scared of him. Lara made the cake at her West Midlands home around working a full time job and looking after her daughters.  She said: It was just trying to find ten minutes here and there. Lara says the hardest part was sculpting Harry and Meghan\u0027s faces from modelling chocolate. She made the cake for the Cake International event, which will be held in Birmingham in November, so her incredible design will be doing into storage for the next few months. A spokesman for Cake International said: The cake was designed to stretch the designer\u0027s boundaries in the art of cake decorating and never intended to be eaten, but enjoyed by thousands as an inspirational feature at Cake International at the NEC in November. It\u0027s also been designed to catch the eye, which it certainly has done so for the artist the cost, ingredients and most importantly the design challenge have been well rewarded.  Lara shared the photos on the parenting website The Motherload and she\u0027s been inundated with comments praising her work.  This isn\u0027t the first time Lara has impressed us all with her incredible cake making skills.  In February she made life-size models of her twin daughters Lily and Lyla for their first birthday party. Speaking at the time, she said: I totally get this won\u0027t be everyone\u0027s cup of tea, but not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself… Why not?! I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday!? I\u0027ll be cleaning buttercream out of the floorboards for months but I reckon it was 100 per cent worth it.  The cakes babies are both wearing first birthday t-shirts and pink tutus to match the real Lily and Lyla for the unique photoshoot. Unsurprisingly the ingredients list for the two cakes is rather long. To make them she used, 44 eggs, 2.2kg flour, 5kg of chocolate, 3kg of fondant icing, 4kg of buttercream and a lot of butter. Lara said: The cakes have taken a fair few hours, I’d say about 100 to 120 hours over the last few weeks.  Most of that time goes into the decorative icing pieces, so the cakes themselves I\u0027ve been rushing to get done over the last week. They are made up of 22 6inch round Madeira cakes and the hair is made out of pulled sugar so I had to make every individual strand separately, I\u0027d say that was the hardest part.

Police are investigating the attempted abduction of a toddler by the Filipino women who were pretending to be missionaries, it is claimed. CCTV footage captured the shocking incident in the small town of Palmares, located in the northern Costa Rica province of Alajuela. A spokesperson for the Judicial Investigation Department (OIJ) said that local authorities have launched an investigation into the alleged kidnapping attempt after viewing the amusement arcade\u0027s CCTV footage. In the short video, the boy is seen pressing buttons on an arcade game while his mother stands just out of shot.  A woman in black turns to leave the arcade and lightly pats the boy on his head as she passes, believed to be a signal for her accomplice. A second woman wearing a striped blue top follows right behind her and touches the boy\u0027s shoulder. She says something to the youngster then takes his hand to lead him out of the arcade. However, as they begin to walk out, the alert mum runs from the far end to stop the apparent kidnapping. According to Costa Rican authorities, the women claim to be members of an evangelical church and come from the Philippines. They have not been seen since the alleged abduction attempt.

A 60 Minutes investigation by Nine News in Australia that aired tonight features a panel of aviation experts working to determine what brought the plane down. Since March 2014 the world has questioned how a Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished into thin air en route from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most of the wreckage has never been found but now but now experts say they finally have the answers. Larry Vance, former senior investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told the Australian current affairs programme he was confident he knows what happened to the aircraft.  “I think the general public can take comfort in the fact that there is a growing consensus on the plane’s final moments,” he said. The panel believe that the man in the cockpit, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was responsible. They all agree the pilot “was killing himself” and took the plane to the most remote spot he could so it would “disappear”.  Boeing 777 pilot and instructor Simon Hardy said Captain Zaharie avoided detection of the plane by either Malaysian or Thai military radar by flying along the border, crossing in and out of each nation\u0027s airspace. Mr Hard told the programme: “As the aircraft went across Thailand and Malaysia, it runs down the border, which is wiggling underneath, meaning it\u0027s going in and out of those two countries, which is where their jurisdictions are.  “So both of the controllers aren\u0027t bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it\u0027s, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s gone. It\u0027s not in our space anymore\u0027. “If you were commissioning me to do this operation and try and make a 777 disappear, I would do exactly the same thing. “As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s very accurate flying because think it did the job and we know, as a fact, that the military did not come and intercept the aircraft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero pilot lands plane after","story":"NewsHero pilot lands plane after cockpit window suddenly SHATTERS at terrifying 32,000ftThe Chinese passenger plane had to make a dramatic emergency landing after the windscreen broke off and the aircraft dropped in altitude\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary14:46, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hero pilot landed a plane after the cockpit window shattered at a terrifying 32,000ft.

The terrified trio were attacked after two dogs went on a rampage in a housing estate and halting site in north Dublin, Ireland, yesterday.  They were hospitalised with bite injuries after the incident, while blood was left smeared down a fence and splattered on a footpath. It is believed the canines were dumped at the entrance to Avila Park, off the Cappagh Road in Finglas at around 1.30pm yesterday.  Witnesses described a female driver in a black car driving up to Avila Park and letting the pair loose, Dublin Live reports.   The dogs first attacked 12-year-old Katelynn Collins, who desperately attempted to climb a metal fence to escape. Fortunately for the youngster, relative Michael Collins arrived to visit his mother and got out of his van to rescue her. “If I’d been 30 seconds later I think I’d be going to a funeral,” Michael said. “It was like something from a horror movie.” He used his phone to hit the dog and get it off traumatised Katelynn, who fell into his arms. As he put her in his van out of harm\u0027s way, one of the dogs left the estate. But the other attacked 11-year-old Dina Collins who suffered three bites to her arm as she tried to protect herself.  Dina recalled: “The big dog came after me and went for my neck, so I put my hands up in the air and he went for my arm. “When he let go of my arm he went for my leg. A man kicked the dog away and I went up to an old woman.” The youngster needed a tetanus shot and antibiotics after the attack. Her arm is now in a sling, but her mum Lisa is relieved it wasn\u0027t worse. “There were small children all around there, it could have killed one of the children,” claimed the shocked mother. Katelynn’s sister Helen, 18, also suffered a \u0027deep\u0027 bite to her leg and was treated at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown. The younger girls were treated at Temple Street Children’s University Hospital.  Police said the trio\u0027s injuries were thought to be minor. Katelynn and Helen’s sister, Megan Stokes, was with her family in Temple Street.  She claimed: “Because we are traveller people they think it’s okay to do this.” Families around the site were celebrating First Communions and feared the incident could have been worse if more children were outside. One of the dogs was cornered in a front garden and Gardai and a dog warden removed it. The second dog was still on the loose in the Finglas area yesterday evening. Locals hoped the dog was microchipped so its owners could be traced.

Bilel Mohsni also looks set to miss out because of the groin injury he picked up right at the end of that morale-sapping 3-2 play off defeat.Immediately after the final whistle gaffer Csaba Laszlo expressed his concern the nature of Mohsni’s injury meant the centre-half would not make the four-day turnaround between games.Two days on the Tunisian international is still struggling to recover.Given his influence on the defence since he arrived March, his absence would be a major setback.“I don’t think in this short time he will be recovered but we are a team and we have to show also that we can stand up,” said Csaba.Mark Durnan is a ready-made replacement for the 30-year-old but problems with an ankle injury mean he hasn’t started a game since the win over champions St Mirren a month ago.Meanwhile, the first of Flood’s two bookings on Monday means he will miss the start of next season under the totting up process.Although United have already lost twice a Livingston this season, the manager still believes they can overcome the 3-2 deficit from the first leg.“It is only one goal and we can win,” added Csaba.“If a chance comes we must take it, this is

I extend my warmest congratulations to all who are joining us this year, each of whom has earnt this prestige by advancing their own field of biomedical science.“Later this year the Academy will celebrate 20 years of supporting the translation of biomedical and health research into benefits for society.\u0026#8220As we celebrate this special anniversary we stand at a crossroads of both enormous health challenges and great opportunity for medical sciences. So I am delighted to see the remarkable breadth and depth of the expertise within our 48 new Fellows.\u0026#8220We look forward to these experts joining us in addressing the health challenges we face head on and exploiting opportunities to improve health in the UK and internationally.”The new Fellows will be formally admitted to the Academy at a ceremony on 27 June 2018.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af04ec3c94e9-381x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee women sarah spends five months creating tapestry artwork of dundee royal infirmary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWow, the detail in this cross-stitch tapestry is truly amazing.Following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, Sarah Anderson spent five months completing the artwork immortalising Dundee Royal Infirmary in 1997.Sarah can be seen showing the piece to Dr Ken Morley and Dr Malcolm MacLean who had supported her through her illness.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Tracy-Palmer-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people i was physically shaking when i got the news says dundee professor being elected a fellow of the royal society","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProfessor Tracy Palmer of the University of Dundee has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), the world\u0026#8217s oldest scientific academy in continuous existence.“Being made a Fellow of the Royal Society is something I have dreamt of but you can never really expect it is going to happen,” Tracy said.“I was physically shaking when I got the news, because I couldn’t quite believe it.“For any scientist this is a major landmark in a career and I am deeply honoured.”Tracy holds a Chair in Molecular Microbiology in the School of Life Sciences at Dundee.Being made Fellow of the Royal Society is a major honour for any scientist.The Fellowship of the Royal Society is made up of the most eminent scientists, engineers and technologists from the UK and the Commonwealth. Past Fellows and Foreign Members have included Newton, Darwin and Einstein.Tracy’s first degree was in Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham. She joined the School of Life Sciences at Dundee from her previous post at the John Innes Centre in July 2007.In 2009 she became head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology. She has received numerous awards throughout her career. In 2002 she jointly received the Microbiology Society Fleming Prize with her longstanding collaborator Ben Berks for their description of the bacterial Tat pathway.She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2009, a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2015, and a Member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 2017.Her group were one of the first to describe the Tat system, an unusual pathway that bacteria use to secrete proteins into the environment. This pathway is used by bacteria to transport proteins that cause disease in humans and animals, and that can degrade antibiotics such as penicillin.More recently, she has also worked on another protein secretion system, named Type VII, in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.Her group demonstrated that S. aureus uses this system to secrete a toxin that kills neighbouring bacteria, a process which is likely to be critical to allow the bacterium to compete with other organisms when it colonises the human body.She is set to take up a new position at Newcastle University in August 2018.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af401ada4aa0-862x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people the royal visits to dundee of yesteryear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tToday’s Dundonian is packed full of great archive photographs taken during royal visits to the City of Discovery down the years.There are pictures of the Queen, Princess Diana and other members of the royal family visiting various venues around the city.Check out the people in the backgrounds too — you might spot someone you know lining up to get a glimpse of the royal visitors.

park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManagers at a city retail park have started legal action against a group of Travellers who have set up camp outside a recently-closed toy store.Last week, the Tele reported that two motorhomes and three caravans had parked at Kingsway West Retail Park.The Travellers set up camp immediately outside Toys ‘R’ Us, which closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.Three of the caravans are parked on disabled parking spaces which are still in operation and fixtures such as barbecues have been erected by the occupants.Site managers working on behalf of the retail park confirmed to the Tele that they were taking the “necessary legal actions” to move the Travellers off the site.A spokesman said: “Both the owner and management team are aware of the occupiers in situ outside the store.“They do not have permission to be on site and as such have been served notice that they must leave the land immediately.“The necessary legal actions are being taken to remove them from the retail park.”Both Dundee City Council and Police Scotland confirmed they were aware of the Travellers’ arrival at the retail park, just yards away from other stores which are continuing to operate.When the Tele approached those living on the site, a man with an Irish accent swore through a crack in his window and said: “Mind your own business.”Only one resident opened their door but closed it immediately after being shown press ID.While the Toys ‘R’ Us store is shut, the unit in which the store operated and the land outside it is owned by fund management firm ARES and operated by the property firm GVA.The site is not licensed for the purposes of camping — meaning those who set up caravans there are doing so illegally.The council operates a licensed site for Travellers just outside Dundee at Balmuir Wood, Tealing.Twenty pitches are available at Balmuir Wood for Travelling communities, each of which features electricity supplies, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you on themselves.”A council spokeswoman said the local authority was aware of and was monitoring the situation.\u0026#8216Mind your own business\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 Travellers move in to car park

mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

in Highland could be eased with a multimillion-pound injection of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to tackle the problem of affordability.The Scottish Government is increasing last year\u0027 \u0026pound28.8 million investment to \u0026pound40.1 million in 2018-19. That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Monday 14 May 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04092000/04092368.jpg","title":"Demand for tougher A82 safety measures","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCampaigners have warned that pedestrians or cyclists could die unnecessarily because there is currently only one set of traffic lights on the entire, busy stretch between the West Link and the Ness Bridge \u0026ndash at the Kenneth Street junction.Despite years of community pressure for safer crossings, a lengthy review by roads agency Transport Scotland has concluded that cosmetic change is ample.It has pinpointed several locations for more prominent road islands, road redesign and new signposts. The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road. It\u0027 a great worry. I don\u0026rsquot know how mums with small children cope with the traffic.Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoA cont-rolled crossing is the only way to improve safety. Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Monday 14 May 2018 3:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like.
