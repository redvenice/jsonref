Taken together, its UK running costs could increase by £650m to £925m, the group said.Without the prospect of the tax break, Allan said it might not have been able to adopt the measures it had to safeguard employees and customers.“I don’t think we’ve done anything that has compromised our commitment to any of our other stakeholders – our employees and our customers – but also our shareholders who fund the business. We think they all deserve fair treatment,” he said.The UK’s biggest supermarket group said the full financial impact of the crisis on its finances this year was “impossible to predict”, with the need to employ extra staff for the duration of the crisis increasing its wage bill by£415m to £580m, depending on the length of the government-imposed lockdown.“The 45,000 extra colleagues that we have recruited is transferring a huge amounts of money to the general public and off the public purse,” Allan said.Dave Lewis, the chief executive, said the retailer had to adapt quickly as the extraordinary increase in demand put pressure on stores and the whole food supply chain.Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco was facing huge extra costs associated with carrying out a “public service”. “I think they have gone out of their way to ensure people have been fed. It could have hunkered down and run the business for shareholders,” he said.

With his moral clarity and anger, the Vermont senator seemed like the last specimen of a dying politics. He was stubborn he refused to change, to “evolve” as the political climate turned.But at a time when mainstream Democrats were telling everyone that we could bootstrap ourselves to prosperity, America’s brutal class system didn’t evolve, either. With millions in poverty or feeling the pangs of hunger in the richest society in history, with millions more jobless, without health insurance, indebted and treated as expendable, Sanders knew there was an audience for his message.Since April 2015, Bernie Sanders has managed to conjure that potential audience into an actual one. He didn’t create the anger at an unjust economic system or the decades of disillusionment with liberal politics, but he did create a clear narrative of what’s wrong, build support for a set of policies that could make things better, and identify the agents of change that could bring a sorely needed “political revolution” to fruition.The core of the Sanders platform has become common sense for millions of Americans. As he put it in his Wednesday morning speech: “We are winning the ideological battle.”Medicare for All, free university and trade school tuition, universal childcare, fair trade and the protection of good jobs, living wages, and a Green New Deal that foregrounds the needs of workers – the most central parts of Sanders’ agenda are now all widely popular ideas.Imagine the shock of Democratic operatives who discovered during Sanders’ rise that defending the material needs of working people is actually popular among working people.But Sanders fell short on the last part of his mission – mobilizing the coalition his political revolution counted on. He needed infrequent voters to turn out, and despite his early success, those voters didn’t materialize. Decades of defeat and disorganization were almost overcome in a matter of months, but almost is scant consolation.Bernie Sanders had hoped that he would emerge out of 2020 as a figure with the power of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, capable of using state power to institute reforms and clear away obstacles to working-class organizing. Instead, he’ll have to accept his place alongside Martin Luther King Jr, Eugene Debs, and Mother Jones – moral leaders against the great evils of their day, leaders who will continue to inspire the struggle for freedom and justice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fcd52164507ab8c8d62f8324a98cb2f53852986/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eb37aa4c4b5b1589fca5e790c4eb00f","title":"cabinet lockdown prime minister coronavirus","story":"The prime minister-less cabinet is united on coronavirus for now. But there are isions on what happens nextWhen reports first emerged that Dominic Raab was the “designated survivor” in the government’s coronavirus strategy, few colleagues took it seriously. Instead, they moved quickly to point out the first secretary of state’s supposed shortcomings: public profile, emotional intelligence, views on feminism. But when Monday’s cabinet conference call revealed that Boris Johnson had been admitted to intensive care, the murmurs and mumbles came to a halt.There is now a concentrated effort to rally behind a figure about whom many hold reservations. The working assumption across government is that in a best-case scenario Boris Johnson will be out of action for a few weeks. In that time, Raab will lead the government – chairing the various meetings and liaising with all departments.Much has so far been made of the limits of Raab’s powers as de facto deputy to Johnson. Despite the designated survivor tag, the role is very different to how that would play out in the American system. We’re told he can’t hire or fire ministers or make decisions without the backing of cabinet, but could potentially start a war if he so desired. But such concerns are a distraction for now: this isn’t the time for a reshuffle or drastic foreign policy announcements. There is only one government task in town: responding to the coronavirus crisis. On this issue, the breadth of Raab’s powers work well in the short term – but not indefinitely.Right now, ministers are working to enact the prime minister’s coronavirus blueprint: summed up as “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”. In order to make that slogan work, there are the four coronavirus sub committees – led by Raab, chancellor Rishi Sunak, health secretary Matt Hancock and minister for the cabinet office Michael Gove – aimed at making sure most people are able to stay at home and that the NHS is prepared. These mini decision-making bodies are credited in government with keeping the show on the road.In the first few days, Raab has won cautious praise from colleagues for not “overreaching” in meetings and deferring to ministers when appropriate. “He’s being a good caretaker manager,” says a government figure who can’t be described as Raab’s biggest fan.The issue coming up the track is what happens if a change in strategy is required. No one in government will talk publicly about an exit strategy. There’s a view in Downing Street that the media focus on a way out of the lockdown is fast becoming a bubble issue.It’s regularly brought up at the daily press conferences and then dismissed on the grounds that the priority is to prepare for the peak of the virus. Some in government have been told polling suggests that when it comes to popular approval, journalists have problems of their own – the public are said to be frustrated with “repetitive gotcha” political questions at the press conferences. With polling also suggesting continued widespread support in the country for the lockdown, there’s a view that the majority of the public have patience when it comes to the current difficulties.However, this is not to say that the the cabinet is united on an exit strategy. While everyone broadly agrees on the day to day, there is a difference of opinion over the purpose of the lockdown and at what point it should be eased. There are reports of tensions between the Treasury and Department of Health on the issue. A number of ministers are arguing that the cost to the general health of the country of the shutdown needs to be factored in more heavily – as well as the immediate cost of coronavirus infections.Hancock’s first priority is making sure the NHS will not be overrun and staff are protected. Meanwhile, Sunak must work to make sure the country is not left permanently poorer to the extent it can’t sustain spending in the future. Keen to dispel reports of tension between them, both took time to praise the other’s work on Tuesday’s conference call – but their briefs can at times compete.Even if the public are largely OK with lockdown, Tory MPs are growing increasingly anxious about its long-term effects and are looking for a plan. As one senior Tory puts it: “Opinion can move very quickly and the work needs to begin before it does.”One potential route out of lockdown is mass testing. But this is also a source of tension in government. Hancock’s promise in a press conference of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month raised eyebrows in other departments. His government critics view it as a pledge he has personally made and must deliver or face the consequences.But if the government fails in its response to coronavirus, it will be a judgment on all ministers and aides – not just one.The differing views on an exit strategy could ease as more data emerges on the level of infection among theUK population or on the effectiveness of physical distancing. The hope among ministers is that Johnson will return before a major decision has to be made. The idea of Raab moving from caretaker manager to the nation’s chief policymaker is riddled with difficulties. Cabinet agreement will be hard to find with the current competing briefs.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eef940076226f62f9bd818e2b844f9dda14fd34/0_9_1775_1065/master/1775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f63130cefe23b8134497798fe4f91d5d","title":"the guardian view on parliament in lockdown time for a virtual recall","story":"It may be technically difficult for MPs to convene but some method must be urgently found for the legislature to resume its vital democratic functionAt the height of the second world war, when parliament had suffered bomb damage, MPs debated modernisation of the notoriously cramped Commons chamber as part of the restoration plan. Winston Churchill was against the idea, praising the “sense of intimacy” created by a throng of MPs. He thought a vibrant democracy needed “scenes and rows … better conducted at close quarters”.Regardless of whether that is true in principle, close quarters spread disease and the coronavirus prevents MPs from assembling in their usual manner. But it does not diminish their role in holding government to account or representing constituents. In any equivalent national emergency MPs would be recalled from their Easter recess. Parliament is the paramount institution of British democracy, and its current invisibility compounds a sense of public unease made more acute when the prime minister is too ill to lead.Dominic Raab is notionally filling in for Boris Johnson, but the foreign secretary has neither the personal mandate nor the constitutional authority to wield executive power. His prior political record is unremarkable. He fell at an early hurdle in last year’s Tory leadership contest, and his subsequent appointment to the Foreign Office was a tribute only to his ideological steadfastness as a hardline Brexit supporter.It is feasible for such a stand-in to chair ministerial meetings and deputise when there is broad cabinet consensus, but that remit is narrow. There is no clarity on the expected duration of the current lockdown measures, which are due for review by the start of next week. Behind closed doors there is debate over the optimal balance between ongoing social restriction to contain the pandemic and the need to permit activity to stave off total economic collapse. Such questions should be aired in parliament.There is also a new Labour leader whose sensible commitment to constructive engagement with government can best be fulfilled when the opposition frontbench is able to question ministerial counterparts. Rushi Sunak’s emergency bailout measures were rightly welcomed across the spectrum on launch, but their operation needs ongoing scrutiny. Flaws, gaps and unintended consequences will best be exposed and rectified when MPs can pass on the experience of their constituents. There are few more efficient ways to correct a government’s course than ministers hearing dissent from their own side of the house.There is no simple way to replicate that mechanism without breaking the rules on social distancing, and the Commons authorities are already hard at work trying to develop one. Models of digital assembly, remote access, partial attendance and online voting are being discussed. Select committees have already taken video evidence. No one should doubt the determination of MPs and parliamentary staff to get the Commons up and running again, but the sticky residue of ancient convention makes progress slow. It is hard enough to change arcane procedures when the chamber is open. There is no precedent for doing it in a lockdown.But the stuffy formality that many people associate with parliament belies a history of innovation and improvisation. And this is no time to be standing on ceremony. While Churchill might have had a point about close-quarters debate, the more pressing issue then, as now, was the continuity of democratic institutions through adversity. The current timetable has the Commons returning in some virtual form on 21 April. That is too long to wait. At a time of extraordinary national emergency, an urgent way must be found for parliament’s work to be done – and be seen to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908e2fc8991ecbf093172b4367aaebeb5f2be970/32_31_1607_965/master/1607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dfa148b506af0e227c8456a93a23471","title":"art virtual reality coronavirus vr","story":"The rise of Covid-19 has forced cultural institutions to explore alternative digital spaces with online exhibitions and a rise in virtual realityIt’s a terrible time for going out. Since the emergence of Covid-19 and resulting self-quarantine, thousands of museums, cultural institutions, festivals and global happenings have temporarily shuttered operations, leaving behind empty streets and a restless public. In a sector that thrives on in-person connection, the loss of an audience is disastrous, yet resilient performers, institutions, galleries, even entire art fairs, are moving to the digital arena, using streaming services and virtual reality, manifesting live concerts on the gaming app Twitch, organizing Instagram dance parties and launching online-only spaces.During his popular 2015 Ted Talk, the immersive artist, entrepreneur and director Chris Milk suggested that virtual reality could someday become the “ultimate empathy machine” but despite an initial burst of interest in 2015 during the launch of the Oculus Rift headset, immersive media have primarily remained niche. Now, with social distancing, the technology is experiencing something of a renaissance.The last few weeks have seen live-streaming performances of the politan Opera and the Cleveland Inner City Ballet to an intimate St Patrick’s Day show from the Boston punk band Dropkick Murphys, with additional groups creating worlds specifically for VR. It is now even possible to take a virtual walk through the New York Botanical Garden’s spring bloom-scape. The pandemic, incredibly, is ushering in a golden age of virtual media, making good on the initial promise of digital, while offering new life and unprecedented access to some of the world’s cultural touchstones, some previously financially or physically inaccessible. While the world has never felt more physically isolated, digital media have offered a bridge, as well as an exciting range of experiences.The past month’s most discussed virtual project has been Art Basel’s Online Viewing Rooms, which proved so popular when it launched that the site crashed. Already scheduled before the outbreak, its debut was fast-tracked in response to the Hong Kong fair’s cancellation, explained Marc Spiegler, global director of Art Basel: “It became clear this was something we needed to accelerate and expand.” The virtual fair, which features 234 galleries and a combined 2,100 works, with perks like ZoomRoom, which enables galleries and artists to walk through viewing areas with potential collectors, appeared to be the most logical response to the unprecedented disruption.David Zwirner Gallery, the first to launch online rooms in 2017, has also seen an uptick in digital interest both on its viewing room platform, David Zwirner Online, and podcast Dialogues. “Online exhibitions can do things that brick-and-mortar exhibitions can’t,” explained Lucas Zwirner, head of content. “They can embed videos, longer excerpts of art-historically relevant material, and artist-created content.” Like any medium, he noted, the online space becomes as meaningful and as fruitful as we are thoughtful in the ways we approach it. “That has been the goal – to come up with something that is effective for reaching collectors and the art world at large, but also appeals to artists because it is contextual, art historic and elegant.” Taking a similar strategy is Pace Gallery, whose roster includes leading tech-influenced artists like Trevor Paglen and teamLab. The gallery began exploring online viewing room platforms last year as part of a major redesign to their website. “Our hope for these online exhibitions is to use the voices of our dealers and curatorial team to create multi-media environments that really invoke an artist and the context in which they were making their work,” said Marc Glimcher, CEO of Pace Gallery. “This is just the beginning of a new era of experiencing art through digital realms.”“Covid-19 has made the push much more urgent,” said Daniel Birnbaum of AcuteArt, which brings together international artists, new media and technology to produce works in VR, augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR), explaining that many technologies in prototype have been bumped up to help deal with widespread user demand. Birnbaum, the former director of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, explained that a move toward digital was inevitable, with or without Covid, but has been surprised at the stunning speed of adaptation. Currently his team has been working with Brian Donnelly, AKA Kaws, on a new type of AR that enables you to place yourself inside immersive environments through the use of an app that has already been downloaded by millions.“It’s an extraordinary thing, that in the middle of a total global crisis, when every museum and every public art institution in the world closes down, and no one can travel, we launched a blockbuster,” he mused, explaining that in his past life it was far more difficult to reach audiences of this size and ersity. “In AR and AV, much of the work is driven by democratizing possibilities,” he explained, “but it is now possible to reach beyond traditional structures and reach different audiences.”“I’ve found that so many who didn’t have any interest in virtual reality are now keen on understanding its capabilities,” said the CEO and founder of Emblematic Group and “Godmother of virtual reality” Nonny de la Peña. De la Peña, who has worked with global journalistic institutions, including the , to bring digital stories to life, demonstrated over Google Hangouts a new project she created for SXSW that permits users to place themselves inside worlds of their creation using Reach, a software program, and a button-based system of De la Peña’s design. “The first initial wave of interest is organizations that are either seeking to create virtual gatherings, because important milestones are suddenly being taken away, and our ability to celebrate together, to organizations that are being asked to do this who desperately need our help to help them get to that point,” she explained. “I still think people are just starting to scan the landscape.”“Before Covid-19, the digital space was almost always treated as an afterthought for expanding an audience beyond the reach of physical spaces,” said the digital strategist JiaJia Fei, the former director of digital at the Jewish Museum in New York. She explained that cultural programming was usually designed, first and foremost, for an in-person audience or on-site experience, and later translated online through a video recording or series of images on the web for documentation purposes. “Now that physical spaces are no longer the priority, the cultural sector is rushing to adapt events, exhibitions and experiences for an entirely digital-first audience.” She pointed out that achieving this requires an eye toward egalitarianism: almost everyone has a mobile phone and computer at home, but very few have traditional VR headsets, which points to a rise in 360 video, Google cardboard, and conferencing tools that can easily be streamed at home. “For digital innovators, this is our moment to push the limit of our creative and technical vision, and a chance to openly experiment,” said Fei. “For everyone else, it’s a crash course in digital marketing triage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0791962e07cebd104c6ea134ee67d782b458f04b/425_614_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f331e9462cd22eb1fb06b9e6d8d086e5","title":"british museum looks to crack mystery over decorated ostrich eggs","story":"Experts reexamine eggs – some dating back to bronze age – to understand origins and designsThey are about the same size as a standard Easter egg, but are rather older – with some specimens dating back five millennia to the early bronze age.A collection of decorated ostrich eggs belonging to the British Museum in London has been reexamined by experts in an effort to understand where they originated, and how their often elaborately painted or engraved designs were created.Until now, most academic study of the eggs has been stylistic, focusing on their designs. An international team of archaeologists, led by experts from the universities of Bristol and Durham, set out to discover more about how cultures across a broad swathe of the Mediterranean, north Africa and the Middle East secured their eggs, and how the highly prized items were made.Their findings, published on Thursday in the magazine Antiquity, reveal that the system by which ostrich eggs were sourced, produced and traded by the elite in society across cultures was “much more complicated than we had imagined”, according to the project leader, Dr Tamar Hodos of Bristol university.Some specimens recovered from the same archaeological site were found by isotope analysis to have originated in completely different parts of the region, while microscopic scanning revealed the intricacy of the techniques by which their geometric or floral designs were produced, although some of the methods remain a mystery.Ostrich eggs that had been engraved, painted and embellished with ivory and other precious fittings were highly prized by cultures across the Mediterranean during the bronze and iron ages, with more than two dozen complete and fragmentary specimens – a number of of them exquisitely worked intact eggs – held by the British Museum.“Ostriches were not indigenous to Europe, so when we find them in Spain or Italy or Greece, they are not coming from there,” Hodos said. “But no one has thought to ask where were they coming from.”Even in areas where ostriches lived at the time, however, such as in the eastern Mediterranean and north Africa, the eggs excavated by archaeologists had sometimes been sourced from distant regions, their isotope analysis found. “This was a really unexpected discovery – that just because you could source an ostrich egg locally doesn’t mean you necessarily did.“This opened up new questions such as: in antiquity, was there some prestige value in an egg that was laid in a different climactic zone?”The team’s microscopic and isotope analysis also suggested that, contrary to their supposition that some later eggs in particular might have been sourced from captive birds, almost all of the specimens were probably collected opportunistically from wild birds, which can be extremely dangerous.With many more questions having been thrown up by the team’s findings, Hodos said she intended to continue research into their origins.“Thousands of years before Easter, people were already decorating eggs. We are now closer than ever to cracking the conundrum of who created the eggs and who coveted them,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5baea2ec1645ff4d94c5cfbcafa4805984820c5/0_47_2999_1799/master/2999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b6ddb427adf203e3c92624cb6d096ac","title":"coronavirus doctors whistleblowers history silenced","story":"Dr Li Wenliang tried to sound the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak. For centuries, doctors have been doing the same – leading to backlash and even deathDr Li Wenliang was an astute observer. Back in December, the Chinese opthamologist noticed that there were a series of patients who had upper respiratory infections in Wuhan that seemed similar to prior Sars outbreaks. He alerted colleagues on WeChat but was quickly criminalized by the state for spreading “false rumours”. It wasn’t until after the young doctor’s death from Covid-19, the same disease he had identified, that the Chinese authorities cleared him of wrongdoing.Just a few weeks later, and a few thousand miles away, American doctors are experiencing a similar silencing. Physicians and nurses have lost their jobs during the surging pandemic for alerting media about shortages of masks and hospital equipment. At the highest level, the Trump administration has resisted the advice of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and a physician, when he called for a more urgent and intense federal response.Central to the art of doctoring is observation. Physicians see disease and destitution in clinics and hospitals. They interview and listen, and trace illness back to family histories and living situations and environment. They advise politicians and government agencies with data and science. For many centuries, this has led doctors to speak out against the powers that be – demanding that they treat at the source. But in many countries, this has also led to backlash, even death.Rudolf Virchow was a German physician in the 19th century, known for linking cancer to the cell. He was also a writer, a scientist and a politician, applying his faculties in microscopy to the city infrastructure in Berlin to curb the spread of disease through sewage and water. Virchow is credited with creating Germany’s first public health programs.Virchow got in trouble regularly – he was expelled from Charite hospital for joining the 1848 revolution, and was ostracized by his colleagues. But the doctor truly found himself in the line of fire when he criticized the government’s investment in the military instead of education and alleviating poverty.As one story goes, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck was so furious that he challenged Virchow to a duel. Bismarck found Virchow at work in his lab, where he had recently identified the roundworm Trichinella spiralis, which can contaminate meat. “I suppose I have the choice of weapons,” the doctor apparently said, and held up two large sausages. He told the Bismarck that one was filled with the roundworm he was studying, the other was completely safe to eat, and asked him to choose one. The duel ended there.Virchow’s fate, however, is in some ways a lucky one. Other physicians who have spoken out on behalf of their patients, or the poor, have suffered blackmail, violence and persecution.In more recent years, Binayak Sen, an Indian pediatrician, highlighted the struggles and inequities in healthcare faced by the most marginalized in Indian society: the country’s aasis, or indigenous people, some of whom identified with a Maoist movement. For three decades, Sen lived in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, where he trained health workers to provide where government healthcare failed. He systematically documented the senseless deaths from malnutrition, lack of access to adequate healthcare and lack of political agency.But the central government started noticing Sen’s activism when he became involved in the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, a human rights organization that investigated abuses against indigenous people. In 2007, the Indian government charged him with sedition, a law originally created by British colonial government to control the local population. He was sentenced to life in prison on charges of supporting a Maoist insurgency.Sen was jailed for several years and spent a considerable amount of that time in solitary confinement. He was released without comment from the supreme court of India in 2011. But 13 years later, his appeal is still pending in front of the Chhattisgarh high court.While some physicians are criminalized for speaking from the margins of society, others are involved in larger revolutionary movements. Such was the case for Steve Biko, a South African medical student who began a social movement to fight apartheid in the 1970s. At the time, healthcare systems for black and white iniduals in South Africa were separate and unequal. Black doctors were largely not allowed to take care of white patients, or even examine their bodies when they died.As Biko was highlighting systemic inequities through his black consciousness movement, he was subject to a “banning order” from the government, which censured his speech and movement. In 1977, he was detained by police under the pretext of a terrorism act, and beaten to the point of brain hemorrage. The prison physician ignored recommendations by a consulting neurologist and neurosurgeon, and Biko died at the hands of the state, alone in a jail cell.That year, a group of doctors filed a claim, demanding that the Medical Association of South Africa take action against the prison doctors, but it was left idle in the court.Eight years later, Dr Wendy Orr, a medical doctor for the government, started to take notice of these cases. Orr said later that she was the only physician “to reveal evidence of police torture and abuse of political detainees in South Africa”. After seeing countless patients showing signs of being tortured by police forces, she alerted her superiors, only to be informed that her job was solely to tend to the wounds and physical complaints that the prisoners had.In the mid 1980s, Orr took her claim to the South African Supreme Court. The court heard both Orr’s case, as well as the one brought on by the doctors hoping to seek justice in Steven Biko’s death. But the Medical Association of South Africa turned their head yet again, refusing to punish those responsible for these prison deaths.Orr became the commissioner for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, where these abuses were recounted in detail for the first time. She recalled later that the stories of witnesses such as Mr Nalgas, a subject of the torture, brought Archbishop Desmond Tutu to tears. “For me this sums up the damage done to all of us by apartheid: it treated black people as something less than human, and it dehumanized white people because they came to believe that,” she wrote.As the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, the censorship and silencing of whistleblowing physicians persists. One the one hand, health workers are held on a pedestal - with citizens lining their windows and balconies to applaud them every evening in cities like London and New York. But when they push their institutions or governments too far - whether calling for public health measures like physical distancing, or funding for something as simple as a mask, doctors risk not only their lives on the frontlines, but also their jobs and basic rights.As Virchow, the German pathologist, astutely noted: “Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cad10467ad3a74596c50d469d2d98b4eade6446/94_472_5877_3526/master/5877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4c25a1bbc9af9a9553f7a45ac0f24e","title":"uk schools not reopen straight after easter officials insist","story":"No 10 and Welsh government insist it will only happen when scientific advice says it is safeSchools across the UK will not reopen after the Easter holidays, after national governments insisted they would only do so when scientific advice said it was safe to proceed.Teaching unions said their members were alarmed by a newspaper report that schools could reopen after the holidays and a review from University College London that cast doubt on the effectiveness of school closures in limiting the spread of disease.But Whitehall sources said no date had been set to reopen schools in England, and that a date would only emerge once scientific advice concluded it was safe for them to do so.The Welsh government also rejected any suggestion that reopening was imminent, with a spokesperson saying: “The Welsh education minister does not plan to reopen schools more generally in the immediate period following Monday 20 April.“Many schools across Wales are providing support to children of critical workers and the most vulnerable and they will continue to play this crucial role given the current public health emergency.”Education policy is one of the most devolved areas within UK government, but ministers and officials from the four national executives have been regularly coordinating and discussing strategy. Schools across the UK were closed indefinitely from 20 March but remain open for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers.At the lobby briefing, No 10 also played down the idea that schools could reopen, pointing to government advisers who said it was too early to talk about any lockdown measures being eased.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told members he had received questions about the UCL review and responded in an email: “The government has not indicated to us that it plans to make any immediate changes to its policy based on the study.”He added: “There will be many views within the medical and academic communities on the effectiveness of the government response to the crisis and sometimes these views will contradict and be in conflict with one another. What remains important at this time is that the public, parents and professionals continue to follow official government advice to keep safe.”An article in the Times on Wednesday quoted an unnamed senior minister as saying: “We need to be led by the science, of course. But if we can reopen schools after the Easter holidays things could begin to get back to normal.”The UCL survey claimed school closures had only a limited impact on the spread of previous infections. But it was criticised by some experts in infectious epidemiology as “cherry picking” and for relying on data from influenza outbreaks and brief school closures.Neil Ferguson, a professor of medical biology at Imperial College London and the author of influential research informing government policy, said school closures played an important role in severing contacts between households when combined with “intense social distancing”.Jules White, the head of a state secondary school in West Sussex, said many school leaders were worried about how the UCL paper was interpreted, with many missing staff through illness or family commitments.“Schools will do everything to support the national effort. But it’s simply not sensible or safe to ask schools to open more fully unless coherent plans are in place to ensure that students, their families and staff will be safe,” White said.“A safe, wider phased return would be positive but only when the time is right and transparent plans are agreed by those who are charged to actually deliver them in our schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8506b029720fc360f691b5c6329591018916b3df/0_179_3997_2398/master/3997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb9a94165e9bf49218a8c59bdee6408","title":"record size hole opens in ozone layer above the arctic","story":"Rare hole is result of low temperatures in atmosphere and is expected to disappear A rare hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole.The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks.Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere – from human activities – caused the hole to form.The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have drastically cut air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability.Peuch said there were no direct implications for the climate crisis. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011.The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission.While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning – in 2018, unauthorised emissions were detected from eastern China.The Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. “However, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f685685b7dfec5102e22751398394d2d9189c597/0_346_4608_2763/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed2cfe740bb7ef703e629f6ca6db6360","title":"wildlife destruction not a slippery slope but a series of cliff edges","story":"New study finds ocean ecosystems likely to collapse in 2020s and land species in 2040s unless global warming stemmedWildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought.Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen.By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest.“It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature.What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse.The authors base their projections on iding the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005.Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.

Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.”Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting.This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating.Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and bioersity loss.“The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f80b82cb249955a82886502070932aa3f9a29f/1605_384_3394_2036/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffeec3c7db53fa91a5423fc88df9c1c","title":"amber heard to testify in johnny depp case behind closed doors","story":"Actor is key witness in libel proceedings brought by Depp against the Sun newspaperAmber Heard will be allowed to give evidence about alleged sexual violence at the hands of her ex-husband Johnny Depp behind closed doors, after lawyers successfully argued she should not be forced to make certain claims in front of the media.Heard is a key witness in a libel case in which Depp is suing the Sun newspaper and its associate editor, Dan Wootton, over an article that referred to the Pirates of the Caribbean star as a “wife-beater”.Depp’s lawyers claimed Heard has been using “salacious” claims to draw attention to the case and questioned her desire to give parts of her evidence without journalists in the room.“She hasn’t sought anonymity, quite the opposite,” argued David Sherborne QC, acting for Depp. He said Heard’s accusations would be proved to be “outright lies” and said they would need to be scrutinised “very carefully”.He argued Heard’s decision to identify as a prominent supporter of the #MeToo movement and publicly take part in United Nations events about sexual violence meant she could not later request privacy when giving evidence.“Is it really the case that she is so distressed that it is necessary for the principle of open justice to be overturned?” asked Sherborne.Mr Justice Nicol, having heard the arguments from Depp’s legal team and Adam Wolanski QC for NGN, who made the case on Heard’s behalf, ruled the nature of the “sexual violence” claims being made by Heard meant she should be allowed to give evidence behind closed doors. “The matters which will be dealt with in private are of a different order to what has been made public so far. I am satisfied that there is good reason to treat them differently.”Heard previously obtained a domestic violence restraining order against Depp in 2016, shortly after she filed for orce. In a separate case, Depp is personally suing Heard for libel in the US over an opinion piece she wrote for the Washington Post in 2018 about being a public survivor of abuse, which did not specifically mention Depp.The British libel trial had been expected to start at the end of March and was expected to feature a string of celebrity witnesses. However, it was adjourned two weeks ago after the judge concluded it was impossible to call on witnesses to travel from around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic.One key issue is the circumstances in which Depp lost the tip of one of his fingers while filming the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film, around the same time the duo were at the centre of a storm over bringing their dogs to Australia. Depp says Heard inflicted the injury on him, while Heard claims Depp did it to himself while on a three-day booze and drugs bender.The hearing on Wednesday morning took place on a Skype conference call, with the judge, journalists and lawyers dialling from as far afield as Australia to watch a sometimes unusual hearing, which was occasionally interrupted by patchy internet connections.Leading QCs made impassioned pleas over their webcams, while the spare bedrooms of leading legal figures were on display for all to see. When the hearing entered a private session, the judge ordered journalists covering the case to hang up the Skype call, with a clerk checking that no reporters remained on the conference call.A spokesperson for Heard welcomed the ruling: “We welcome Mr Justice Nicol’s decision to allow evidence relating to ‘sexual violence’ to be heard in closed court. There is simply no reason for such sensitive evidence to be exposed to the world’s press.“We are pleased that the court made this order despite Depp’s troubling argument that Amber should not benefit from the right to privacy in relation to sexual violence, because of her public association with the #MeToo movement and her advocacy for victims of sexual violence at the United Nations.”The trial is scheduled to take place in July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6495f40152ef3ec8408d1ebfe33fdbf28e7f002b/0_0_3062_1838/master/3062..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba418bceceff5c2e6716e810410bd4fa","title":"ive never seen the shawshank redemption","story":"This enduring, much-loved classic about wrongful incarceration and dreams of liberation is an unlikely but irresistible joy in the lockdown eraIn a week when my home was turned into a kind of Ikea-heavy minimum security unit, and I was treated by the government like a benign 80-year-old lifer who is trusted to go out once a day, watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time was a chastening slap round the chops. Annoyed you can’t go to the pub? Hey, at least your only option for a beer doesn’t involve bargaining with a sadistic prison warden dangling you from a rooftop!My only real sense of the film came from a friend complaining about an immersive Secret Cinema screening, where he and his girlfriend, having spent £60 each to have a nice date together, were put on prison buses, given the role of convicts, and split up for most of the evening. Perhaps for some long-suffering couples this is what you actually pay for.Anyway, having not seen it, I felt very much in the minority. Adapted in 1994 by writer-director Frank Darabont from a Stephen King story about a man clinging on to his humanity during a wrongful sentence for murder, The Shawshank Redemption has long been deemed the No 1 movie of all time on the user-voted IMDb chart, ahead of The Godfather and The Dark Knight. It earned seven Oscar nominations, became a slow-burn hit via video rentals, and King said it was his favourite adaptation of his work (though he doesn’t like The Shining, so, pinch of salt).It’s telling that it’s top of that IMDb list, while nowhere to be seen on the lists of greatest films put out by serious-minded institutions such as the BFI. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie, not a film: all plot and no pretension. Darabont creates some painterly moments – I loved the crane shot above the prison yard as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) illicitly plays opera over the PA to the cons below, an image from LS Lowry – but everything is in service to the storytelling.I was lucky: big single twists are revealed quickly on tell-tale social media, but The Shawshank Redemption uses enough of them to keep its secrets hidden. Iconic movie scenes filter through to you osmotically – in this case, those beers on the roof – and I even knew that Andy gets some kind of liberty: that arms aloft moment in the rain, another iconic scene. But I wasn’t prepared for the neatness of the narrative logic (minus an error so notorious an entire play has been made about it) or the film’s brilliant tempo: slow and steady, and then exponentially faster, with an unusual sustained coda.Having your liberty curtailed gives this well-told yarn an extra frisson, because imprisonment – the kind we are experiencing a VR version of right now – terrifies us all, and The Shawshank Redemption plays on that terror with exacting design. It does a great job of showing how small your life becomes when cast against all that time how pleasure narrows to the width of a cigarette. Prison rape, with its subjugation and violence made repellently taboo by homophobia, is comfortable society’s great male fear, and has power even when deployed as coyly as it is here.The Shawshank Redemption also makes you wonder why there isn’t a prison-break movie every year: underneath the straightforward tension sits a profound thrill at the subversion of the authority we spend every day honouring.The movie has flaws. That prison soap must be suffused with argan oil – either that or Robbins’ scalp secretes pomade, given his lustrous locks are more solid than those securing the cell doors. It’s a hugely sentimental film, for better and worse, and for me the casting of Morgan Freeman as Red isn’t ideal, even if he did get an Oscar nomination. You can’t imagine him having done anything criminal in his life, unless it was twinkling someone to death. (Perhaps this is a way the film suffers from being watched so long after it was made, with Freeman long since installed as America’s grandad.)But there are really superb moments. Robbins is excellent, letting glee drip into Andy’s demeanour a micrometre at a time. The script has Red telling us that he’s institutionalised, but it doesn’t need to: the brief puff of air into his new harmonica, terrifying him with its potential for free expression, does it for him. And overall, that unhurried, graceful yet steely storytelling style earns it a place somewhere in the IMDb Top 250, if not the No 1 spot. Crack open some cold suds and enjoy – and be thankful your front door still opens from the inside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c9aacc8c5946835d481bc0343333c0f4c0db59/0_860_1067_640/master/1067..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6000973faac97b8d193b0b38786eb313","title":"felicity cloake perfect lockdown cooking recipes pea soup fishcakes dal tomato sauce pilaf banana bread blueberry muffins oatcakes summer pudding","story":"Our resident perfectionist picks 10 of the best from her recipe archiveIt feels a bit like we’re competing in a national episode of Ready Steady Cook right now, and I for one have been rehearsing for it my entire life.Store-cupboard roulette is my favourite kind of cooking: for those of us fortunate enough to have such reserves, it’s a challenge in which there are no losers – after all, how bad can macaroni cheese be, even if the macaroni is actually Bob the Builder pasta and the cheese comes wrapped in jaunty red wax?

The technology behind them improves each year, so at the very least, old games can benefit from having spectacular new visuals applied to them. This remake of 1997’s Final Fantasy VII – often hailed as one of the greatest games ever made – goes way beyond a mere graphical makeover. Nearly a decade in the making, it expands and completely reimagines the original game, but crucially without losing its essence.The opening mission, featuring ex-soldier Cloud Strife teaming up with eco-activist organisation Avalanche, is pretty much the only part of Final Fantasy VII Remake that is a scene-by-scene update of the original. Even that sequence showcases a much-improved battle system, which is uncharacteristically action-based for a Japanese RPG, but remains underpinned by the original’s turn-based system and supports the tactical depth for which the genre is known. You still have to wait for a recharge before using special abilities and items or casting spells, but you can always employ standard attacks, and dodge or block incoming strikes.As the game progresses, the combat acquires extra layers, including so-called Limit Break attacks perfect for finishing off the more dangerous foes, and the ability to summon demons. The original game’s Materia system, which lets you attach different elemental traits to slots in your equipment, is more or less unchanged and brings a wealth of magic attacks and new special abilities.Final Fantasy VII’s storyline was what elevated it to classic status and in the remake, Square Enix has greatly expanded this aspect. Narrative moments that were originally short sequences involving moving from one place to another have now taken on a more quest-like feel, which helps the game’s general coherence and improves the ebb and flow of the plot.The original game’s eco-warrior theme felt progressive in 1997 and is more relatable now. The evil Shinra corporation is bleeding the planet dry of its lifeblood, called “mako”, and the rather naive Avalanche embarks on a campaign that involves blowing up its mako reactors, only to encounter a welter of plot twists before another villain emerges.Some super-fans have griped that expanding the story has caused the remake to become bloated, but the original story was often delivered in a rushed, breathless manner, and it now has time to unfold in a more detailed way, and the overarching story arc has been preserved.Another major addition to the remake are the periods of open-world gameplay, in which Cloud and his sidekicks take on side missions in the slums of the mega-city of Midgar, after performing their main-story raids. As with any collection of side missions, they vary wildly in theme and quality, from the ridiculous to the worthwhile, but the opportunities they provide to embark on intimate explorations of previously unseen parts of the game world prove welcome.As the game unfolds, Cloud assembles a shifting band of allies, many of whom join him in battle. They have complementary skills to the sword-wielding protagonist: Barret, for example, is a tank-like character armed with a machine-gun Tifa a hand-to-hand combat specialist and Aerith a staff-wielding mage. In combat, you can only control one character at a time, but you can switch between them, and even instruct characters you aren’t directly controlling to launch special attacks or use items on party members. Learning such techniques is vital to prevailing in the satisfyingly epic boss-battles.As with other Final Fantasy games, a certain amount of cheesiness occasionally creeps in to the narrative. Some of the peripheral characters prove annoyingly one-dimensional, and too many of the villains are characterised by cartoonish evil laughs.That said, Final Fantasy VII Remake elevates the original to new heights. It looks spectacularly good, but, more importantly, its gameplay has acquired a modern sheen without losing what made the game distinct in the first place. The insertion of new action sequences and the expansion of existing ones adds welcome variation, and it’s very meaty, too, with over 30 hours of gameplay on offer.What you get here is only the first half of the original game – a second, concluding instalment will arrive at a time as yet unspecified by Square Enix. Remaking a universally acclaimed classic was always a fearful responsibility, but like its own sword-wielding heroes, Square Enix has risen to the challenge spectacularly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2341b49034daa22d441da5a5a359fd381e614207/0_418_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=573bb23e1a16bc83cc248d0210998d2a","title":"global health policy can we manage the ever increasing rise of diabetes","story":"More than 400 million people have diabetes. While the condition can be treated effectively in the west, in low-income countries there is a need to improve access to insulin, medical devices, and health programmes to ensure early diagnosis and careTogether with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes has become one of the world’s four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and one of the only chronic diseases that continues to increase in prevalence.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and in 2016 it caused 1.6 million deaths, making it the seventh leading cause of death. The WHO estimates deaths from diabetes will increase to 2.4 million in 2030 and 3.7 million in 2045.The pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through Global Health Progress, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease.But what’s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that “the dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition. It needs to take in issues such as a lack of trained health practitioners, inadequate supply chains and weak health systems in developing countries.”“Access is a complex issue,” says Helen McGuire, programme leader, noncommunicable diseases at global health organisation Path. “Failures of access in low-resource settings are rarely due to a single cause.“Barriers must be addressed by leveraging multi-sectoral partnerships, which bring the unique expertise and resources of governments, non-profits, and industry to the table. Solutions require a long-term approach addressing issues of quality, affordability, availability, acceptability, and sustainability.”Emma Klatman is a health systems specialist at the international diabetes charity Life for a Child, which is tackling type 1 diabetes in low and middle income countries, where mortality rates among young people are especially high.Living without treatment can have horrific consequences, she says, and young people are faced with “blindness, losing limbs, developing kidney problems, and they just remain chronically unwell. They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.”The charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes.It’s a point echoed by McGuire. “Self-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes – therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,” she says. “Co-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.”Next year is the centenary of insulin’s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.The first insulin pen was introduced in 1985 and immediately improved the accuracy of treatment. Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R\u0026ampD into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones.Sanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively.Working with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day.“Affordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.”Klatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families “are able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac3262eb862a597b9679b63c06a0cfd6b101d633/0_117_5012_3010/master/5012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29ba3fd655436cb203426c442e22cec2","title":"from vitamin c to breathing exercises doctors on what you should really do for your health right now","story":"There is a lot of confusion about how to protect yourself from illness – and what to do if do you contract coronavirus. Here is the expert adviceYou will already be regularly washing your hands and social distancing, but many of us are still likely to become infected with coronavirus. Doing what you can now to improve your health and boost your immune system will help your body cope. Thankfully, the majority of cases are mild and you should recover within a week, though if your symptoms are persistent it is vital to seek medical advice from NHS 111 rather than try to continue to manage at home. With that in mind, here’s what you can do to put yourself in the best position to help your recovery.There is no magic supplement. The advice is as it’s always been: reduce your alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep well and reduce stress. A varied, balanced diet, with lots of vegetables and fruit, is important, but there is little evidence for most vitamin and mineral supplements. Getting out in the sun each day can also be beneficial, says the GP Amir Khan. “The majority of people have low vitamin D because we don’t have enough sunlight in the UK, and we are coming out of winter. Vitamin D levels will be depleted, so there’s no harm in taking a vitamin D tablet.”Many people who are suspected of having had the virus report at least one day of fatigue. Now is not the time to try to tough things out. “Your body is using all its energy to fight a virus that is infecting cell after cell,” says Khan. “Even with mild symptoms, you’ll have some days when you feel fine and other days when you are tired and achey. You can potter around the house and make food if you need to, but you shouldn’t be doing any more than that and, where possible, you should be on the sofa or in bed.”Khan says: “Everybody should be sticking to two to three litres of fluid a day” – as normal. When you have a fever, says Saira Ghafur, an honorary respiratory consultant at St Mary’s hospital in London, “you can become dehydrated, so you need to make sure that even if you don’t feel like it, you’re drinking as much as possible. If you feel you’re not peeing very much, that’s another sign you’re very dehydrated and should seek medical advice.”Take paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen. There has been concern that ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory, could reduce immune function and make coronavirus symptoms worse, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. Still, the advice is to take paracetamol for fever and muscle pain instead. “If you have been prescribed ibuprofen then discuss that with your medical practitioner,” says Wingfield.Khan has seen advice online about taking vitamin C to treat coronavirus – but that doesn’t mean you should be trying this at home. “It has been used intravenously in very, very high doses in hospitals in China. That’s a big difference to what you get in a tablet. The jury is still very much out in terms of using intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus.”Taking a vitamin C tablet from the chemist or supermarket “won’t stop you getting an infection and it won’t help treat the infection”, says Khan. And certainly don’t try to take very high doses.Don’t pin your hopes on “superfoods” or the social media posts about “alkaline” foods (a virus doesn’t have a pH level, and you can’t change the body’s pH level through diet). What about garlic? “It may help reduce the length of things like a cold, but won’t prevent it,” says Khan. And there’s no evidence it has any effect on coronavirus.It’s far from clear. On Monday, the author JK Rowling shared a video of Sarfaraz Munshi, the head of urgent care at Queen’s hospital in Romford, London, demonstrating breathing techniques that he said could relieve symptoms and prevent someone developing a secondary pneumonia infection. People with asthma and those recovering from pneumonia are often helped by respiratory physiotherapists, says Wingfield, “who can help support your breathing with exercises. The main thing you are trying to do is make patients’ lungs open as much as they can and try and get rid of some of the fluid and inflammatory material.”“What you’re really doing there is forcing air into the alveoli by taking big breaths in and holding the alveoli open, and that will help clear any excess mucus, pathogens, as well as stop them from becoming hardened, which can happen. This is with the caveat that you are safe to stay at home and you don’t need to be in hospital. If there’s any chance of pneumonia, you should be in hospital.”However, Laura Breach, a spokeswoman for the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care (ACPRC), says while the exercises should be harmless for healthy iniduals, she would not advise them, adding that they could make symptoms worse in someone suffering breathlessness. Although Munshi’s video was well-intentioned, the ACPRC says the techniques are not correct (it is preparing its own video). If you did try the exercise, you only need to take three or four breaths so as not to hyperventilate and become dizzy, and if you have coronavirus symptoms, there is no need to make yourself cough as part of the exercise. “We would always encourage nose-breathing rather than mouth-breathing, because your nose is really important in humidifying the air that you breathe in and catching any particles in the air,” says Breach.There is no evidence these exercises will help healthy people prepare for the illness, she says. “There are patients with longer-term respiratory conditions and we do teach them techniques to give them a better starting point. If it’s something you should be doing then your healthcare professional will have already advised that.” Instead, the ACPRC says: “Propping yourself up with pillows, or leaning forward onto the back of a chair” can be beneficial to breathlessness.Wingfield also questions whether the exercises can aid recovery from coronavirus – “it’s a slightly evidence-free zone” – and says if you are having trouble breathing, you should seek medical help rather than simply try to follow breathing exercises at home. “But they can keep your lungs moving, and some people might find these exercises meditative and stress-relieving,” says Wingfield. Ghafur agrees: “None of this is evidence-based.”One of the big things in intensive care that we’re seeing with a lot of patients,’ says Ghafur, “is you have to put them on a ventilator in what we call a prone position, which basically means you’re lying on your front. It’s not in any recommended guidance for patients who are not in intensive care, but if you’re able to lie on your front for a while that can help breathing.” There’s no harm in trying it, she says, but only if you’re generally fit and healthy. Do not try to lie on your front if you are older, infirm, have mobility problems or are pregnant.Lying continuously on your back is not ideal. “If you can sit and take deep breaths in and out, that will help any respiratory condition – you’re taking in a bigger lungful of air and that will help remove any mucus.” However, she adds that there is no evidence that this will improve your recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882464b7dd634a93b8c48780f0b6eab4eac217b2/0_94_3007_1805/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fc7af94e8f59709c0af1e72246f0555","title":"how are you celebrating easter in lockdown coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear how you are marking the holiday in the midst of the coronavirus pandemicFor many people across the UK, Easter will look very different this year.

But with a little effort, you can see that voice for what it is – and the benefits are endlessSolitude can be painful. The silence, the loneliness, the absence of mental stimulation from social interaction – and for many, enduring time alone with your thoughts.If you’re struggling with this during the lockdown period, ironically you’re not alone. One study from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard universities found that many would rather give themselves an electric shock than be alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes. One reason why people find it so hard is their inner critic – that annoying voice in your head that chastises you and plays on your insecurities.Everyone has one, but its dominance varies from person to person. I came to the realisation that my inner critic was louder than I wanted it to be while living alone for the first time (it’s probably why I had avoided living alone for so long in the first place).Faced with its repeated assaults on my self-esteem, I decided it was time to take this villain on using a technique from my training to become a psychiatrist – cognitive behavioural therapy. Simple and effective, CBT teaches you to rationalise the negative thoughts that can make you feel down or anxious.These troublesome negative thoughts are often derived from an unhelpful “core belief”, usually formed by your early experiences. Maybe you tried for the school football team but didn’t make the cut? Inner critic: “You’re a failure.” Maybe you were bullied at school or your parents were quick to criticise? Inner critic: “Nobody likes you.”Your dastardly inner critic fires negative thoughts at you to persuade you that your core beliefs are facts. But thoughts are not facts, they are just ideas and like all ideas they need to be tested.So whenever I was attacked with one of my own unhelpful core beliefs or any of its derivative negative thoughts, I started weighing up the evidence for and against them. With time and effort, I started to realise that my inner critic was spouting nonsense.I’m a lot more comfortable with time alone now that I’ve discredited this voice. It still tries to feed me misinformation, of course, much like a conspiracy theorist on social media saying the coronavirus is a hoax or a consequence of 5G. I don’t entertain those views because they are not based on evidence, so why should I believe my inner critic?So, what are your unhelpful core beliefs? If you want to silence your inner critic, start writing down the evidence for and against the negative things it says to you – then, you can see objective proof of their invalidity. When the inner critic uses a mishap to try and convince you of your shortcomings, look for other possible explanations.It can be hard to see the positives when you’re stuck in a negative mindset, but with practice you can always find evidence against your inner critic’s views because they are so blinkered. Sure you have failed at some things, everyone has, but you have definitely succeeded at plenty of others.Eventually you will have disproved your inner critic so much you will see it as a drunk relative at a family gathering, rambling on but not worth listening to. You will also realise that as any situation can be seen from different perspectives, why not choose the most helpful one?There is, of course, room for positive change in all of us, but it should come from ourselves and not our inner critic, which is more interested in self-flagellation than self-improvement. If you can get a handle on this while in lockdown and learn how to rationalise your negative thoughts, it could make the whole experience easier. Your inner critic is holding you back in life by filling you with self-doubt, so overcoming it might just be the most useful thing you have ever done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8993a6a31c40cc539e977959aacf8454b65edae7/0_414_5280_3166/master/5280..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbbb80f284039d8f252e75b35ba87a46","title":"reschedule flights get refund airlines easyjet coronavirus","story":"Booking agents and airlines such as easyJet have been overwhelmed in the coronavirus crisis Mytrip is refusing to reschedule the £2,100 flights I booked. They’ve variously told me their systems are down, that they’ll transfer me to another department that then doesn’t answer, and that I should contact the airline.JS, Douglas, Isle of ManOther readers have shared similar frustrations. Mytrip, part of Etraveli Group, is facing the same challenges as every other booking agent – an inundation of customers whose trips have been cancelled and a shortage of personnel to deal with them. Its website states that priority is being given to those who were due to fly within six days and that it may take up to eight weeks for those with later departures to receive a refund or new travel date.“We contact the airlines and then get back to our customers as soon as we receive their reply,” it says. “Staff are working seven-day weeks to help, we are training staff from other departments and trying to get former colleagues to jump in.”Many passengers whose cancelled flights were booked direct through an airline are facing similar obstacles. EasyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don’t want to reschedule to join the queue for the helpline.JD of West Hoathly, West Sussex has no use for a rebooking since his cancelled flight was to his late brother’s deathbed. “You cannot email easyJet and it has suspended its ‘chat’ facility,” he writes. “Each time you call customer service you get a message telling you to call back later. I understand they are swamped, so why not let people claim online?’’IM of Rimons, France reckons the reason is “a cynical ploy to force people to book another flight and not refund”. EasyJet argues many airlines are not issuing refunds at all, but ducked the question as to why the online option has been removed. “We are experiencing higher than average wait times and assure customers that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown,” it says.Ryanair does offer a refund option online but its system collapsed under the strain with readers reporting reservation numbers were not recognised. Ryanair blamed a “temporary glitch”.SM of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, accepted vouchers from Iberia in lieu of a refund, but when she tried to rebook her family of four on a new date, the system only accepted one voucher per booking. “Iberia suggested I book each passenger separately, but as our children are under 11 the system won’t allow that,” she writes. “The vouchers are only valid for one year, and it’s unlikely that we travel enough this year to get to use all four.” Iberia says it was aware of the issue and was working to amalgamate multiple vouchers into one for family bookings.Jet2 seems to be a rare example of an airline getting it right. “I called customer services as soon as our flight was cancelled and the refund was on my card that afternoon,” writes ME of Harrogate, North Yorkshire. “If Jet2 can do it, why not the other companies?”Most rental firms are also waiving cancellation or amendment fees, although Thrifty is more restrictive and Goldcar is still refusing modifications or cancellations for non-refundable budget bookings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d791d4b525d705e9bab3a5980dba5d156d1e20a7/612_334_2814_1688/master/2814..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef664e69aa672cedf0806397e967c9dd","title":"joan baez where to start in her back catalogue","story":"In the Listener’s digest series, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Today: the first lady of folk-rockDiamonds and Rust (1975)Invigorated by her new creative freedom after splitting with Vanguard Records in the early 1970s, Joan Baez wrote more of her own music than ever. The period led to inspired bouts of experimentation (she soundtracked a sci-fi film) as well as patience-testing indulgences (a 21-minute antiwar song on her 1973 album Where Are You Now, My Son?). Diamonds and Rust was the crowning achievement of her imperial period and one of the best singer-songwriter albums of the 70s.The crystalline voice that had made Baez the first lady of folk-rock had weathered into a warmer tone, and a kaleidoscope of genres including rock, jazz and soul added new colours to her maturing Washington Square sound. A stately take on Stevie Wonder’s ballad I Never Dreamed You’d Leave in Summer evokes the closing credits of a prestige weepie, while on the freewheeling Joni Mitchell duet Dida, the two singers’ voices swoop like swallows at dusk.Baez had butted heads with the 60s women’s movement, particularly for appearing on a cheeky anti-Vietnam conscription poster that stated: “GIRLS SAY YES to boys who say NO.” But Diamonds and Rust platforms women’s stories in its own way. Children and All That Jazz is a collaboration with the jazz virtuoso Hampton Hawes where Baez’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics describe the mindset of a frazzled mother – a perspective rarely made space for in “serious” art – her vocals doing soprano trapeze-work among the flurries of instrumentation.She is also unafraid to skewer the mythos of the scene that made her. The album’s title track is Baez’s greatest song, a clear-eyed postmortem of her romantic relationship with Bob Dylan that details rapturous highs and a novel’s worth of small cruelties. “As I remember your eyes were bluer than robin’s eggs  My poetry was lousy, you said,” she sings, her voice curdling. There’s more than a hint of that bruised sentiment in the “man child” poet Lana Del Rey described on Norman Fucking Rockwell, an artistic synergy confirmed by Del Rey and Baez’s exquisite live performance of Diamonds and Rust last year.There’s a strange, theremin-like purity to Baez’s singing voice in the traditional songs of her 1960 self-titled album that has led many critics to name it the best of her output that decade. Yet her outlaw taste and versatile abilities are more visible on Joan Baez5, which includes singular takes on songs written by Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan, as well as a cut-glass cover of protest singer Phil Ochs’ There But for Fortune (it was Baez’s first UK Top 10 hit). Her embrace of global genres from Brazilian baroque to 18th-century English folk deeply intuitive here, while her version of Dylan’s It Ain’t Me Babe is sung as both a lament and a warning, perhaps as a sign of the couple’s souring relationship. Baez was beginning to show her teeth.Come From the Shadows (1972)While Baez was a force in the 60s anti-war movement and a civil rights advocate, politics hit her closer to home in 1969 when her husband, the anti-war journalist David Harris, was jailed for draft evasion. The resulting album, Come From the Shadows, had Americana flourishes, a folk soul, and was unambiguously in conversation with 70s rock. In the Quiet Morning is an ecstatic elegy for Janis Joplin, the stately piano of Rainbow Road recalls classic Elton John, while To Bobby calls out Bob Dylan for his lapsed activism (he was unamused). Most stunningly, Baez is reinvented as a country empath in Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose), recruiting a cast of Nashville musicians in a call-out of police brutality and the inhuman treatment of undocumented immigrants, climaxing in a grave call to action: “Help us raze the prisons to the ground.”Whistle Down the Wind (2018)With a deeper vocal range and steely point of view, Baez’s 25th and (supposedly) final album is a late-period victory lap with eyes firmly on the here-and-now. These 10 covers  genres and epochs, peaking with the moving title track, a Tom Waits cover on which Baez sings of a life misspent in husky, mournful tones. She also updates an Anohni ballad for today’s climate emergency, while a cover of Zoe Mulford’s The President Sang Amazing Grace, a song about the in 2015, is a masterclass of teeth-gritted grace. Baez’s fundamental optimism is intact even as she surveys the wreckage of the world. “It’s the bitter end we’ve come down to,” she sings over uplifting piano. “The eye of the needle that we gotta get through.”The Altar Boy and the Thief (from Blowin’ Away, 1977)In the late 70s, Baez was an outspoken opponent of the Briggs initiative, a cruel proposal to ban gay and lesbian people from working in California schools. Her LGBTQ+ allyship was vividly brought to life in The Altar Boy and the Thief, a spare piano ballad from 1977’s Blowin’ Away. Inspired by the Pink Elephant, her local Santa Monica gay nightspot, Baez immortalises the bar’s open cruising and queens with “finely plucked eyebrows and skin of satin” in a cry for the rights of queer+ communities to live “unshamed”. It’s still hard to listen to without getting a lump in the throat.And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir, by Joan Baez (1987)Baez’s autobiography is wry, witty and refreshingly candid on clashes with Dylan and within her marriage, her commercial flops, and the unglamorous realities of activist life.Joan Baez’s Fighting Side, by David Browne, Rolling Stone (2017)Baez is in puckish spirits in this evocative and funny profile, holding forth on dating Steve Jobs in the 1980s, blaming a bad album cover on her quaaludes phase and showing off her new bling.Joan Baez5: Sleeve notes, by Langston Hughes (1964)Hughes’s essay on Baez is as brilliant as you’d expect from the Harlem renaissance legend. It’s part autobiography, part poetic interpretations of her music. “When she is singing, so uniquely – she becomes the song – and it is hers,” he wrote. “And therefore artlessly, art.”• What is your favourite Joan Baez recording?

The co-founder of one food bank shares her diary of its journey during the Covid-19 crisis When my job running the media team for a music festival was put on hold two weeks ago, it meant I had time to help my mum, Jacqui, keep our local food bank open during the coronavirus outbreak.Ten years ago, I helped set up Wadebridge food bank. It was only the second one in the county and many said it was not needed in our affluent area of north Cornwall, beloved of royalty and MPs. Yet it has fed 28,000 people since it opened and, last year, my mum received an MBE for her tireless commitment to serving those in need. But she is 68 and many of her volunteers are older. Even before the government-imposed lockdown, demand had skyrocketed and volunteers had stepped back. We’ve had to roll out new processes overnight to get supplies to the people who need it most. This is our journey.Food bank is technically closed today, but it’s my last child-free day before schools shut, so we’re planning furiously. We’ve set up hand sanitisers and restricted access. Government and Trussell Trust guidelines are changing daily. People are stripping the supermarkets bare, but they’re donating huge amounts of food – which is a relief, as we know we’ll need it in the weeks to come.Today’s recommendation is a 72-hour quarantine for donated food, to minimise the chance of infection via a packet of pasta (if we ever see one of those again). Our premises are too small for our normal needs, let alone this. We’ve been raising funds for somewhere larger for a while, but we need more space today. Mum calls the estate agent. Later, we are loaned a shop for storage. It’s astoundingly generous – and just in time. We get a call from the National Trust offering us boxes of Easter goodies and 600 chocolate eggs.Schools have closed and our administrator has brought her children in with her. We’re key workers, but plans are still being finalised for their tiny school of 51 children, so they’re sharing her office chair while she perches on a stool and fields phone calls.Usually a referral agency – such as social services, a school or a doctor’s surgery – issue a paper voucher, which a client brings to a food bank and exchanges for food. This ensures that long-term support is offered as well as crisis help. Now that agencies are working remotely, issuing paper vouchers isn’t possible. Should they email us? Can clients just come to pick up food? Our normal systems are no longer fit for purpose and we’re not sure of the best way forward. Demand is surging and it’s difficult to know whether this is the new normal or temporary panic.Businesses across town are closing. Costa Coffee offers us leftover milk. Local bakeries donate bread. We plug in every freezer we have.My husband calls a crisis meeting after Boris Johnson announces a lockdown. My parent’s annexe is connected to our house. We agree to operate as one, seeing as we’re working together, but we need a plan to protect us and ensure the food bank can still operate. We agree to close for the day. This is a critical incident, my husband says. Plan well and you’ll get through it.Our administrator spends the day on the telephone to the Trussell Trust, which we are part of, implementing an e-referral system to replace physical vouchers. Almost half of our 60 volunteers have resigned. They’re heartbroken but can’t continue. Their children insist they shield. Thankfully, we’ve had new offers of help: an influx of working-age people like me, whose day jobs are redundant, including a father and his 18-year-old son, now no longer sitting his A-levels.We restructure and draw up new rotas. We have a small team of (mainly retired) volunteers at our central Wadebridge hub. It usually opens four mornings a week, with four people processing food and two in the office. It’s cramped when everyone is in, so to allow for social distancing we split into pairs and add an afternoon shift. Only one person in the office at a time. To build in resilience, everyone is allocated one shift a week, including Mum. The rest must be done from home. We slot new volunteers into the gaps, placing them alongside old hands to train them on the job in case people get sick or drop out.We reopen, but as a different type of food bank. We are now delivery-only. As well as food collection points, we also ran drop-ins which provided a cup of tea, a friendly listening ear and signposting to other services. Closing them is a big loss. But limiting public contact is a necessary step. Our drivers will deliver boxes to each location twice weekly as usual, and from there new teams will oversee delivery within each town, calling ahead and leaving boxes on doorsteps.Some of our volunteers are struggling with their reduced shifts. Some have learning difficulties or mental health problems. For many, volunteering is a lifeline. They miss the camaraderie and structure that it gives them. Distancing ourselves – from each other and the people we serve – is tough for us all. We’re a family, a unit, a vital part of our community. But health and safety come first.Going into the second week of lockdown, standard food boxes remain unchanged – three days’ worth of dried and tinned food – but it’s the extras that are usually offered in person, such as nappies, toiletries, pet food and fresh food, that are harder to manage now. A local hotel delivers a van full of produce. Trying to bag it for delivery adds another layer of complexity. We know that these donations won’t continue for ever, so we eke them out as best we can.We get in to find more deliveries scheduled than food boxes prepared. We work solidly for an hour but we’re still behind when the driver arrives. Systems obviously still need tweaking – this may mean some people have to wait longer for food, and we may need to add a third delivery slot.The driver covers 52 miles across three towns, delivering 28 food boxes to two distribution points, collecting donations from five supermarkets and picking up 16 boxes of Cornish pasties from a wholesaler. Iniduals are still donating food via supermarkets, but much less than last week – perhaps because they are shopping less or collection boxes have been moved as supermarkets rearrange store layouts for social distancing. Like everyone, we’re desperately short of tinned tomatoes and pasta.We’ve fed 135 people this week – double the number for the same period last year – and given out 800kg more food in March than we’ve received, dipping into the reserves of food built up at Christmas. Family referrals have increased the most, mainly from school support workers. They include parents who have to stop work to care for children, those already on low incomes who have lost shifts, and new referrals from the self-employed, many of whom never thought they would need a food bank. Cornwall has one of the lowest GDPs in the country and a highly seasonal, fragile economy. Government help will still take weeks to come through. Like supermarkets, we’re working around the clock to implement change and increase capacity so that we can continue to get food to the most vulnerable. Unlike supermarkets, we are not multinational corporations. Operating on a shoestring, run by volunteers and reliant on donations, if analysts’ predictions are correct and unemployment doubles, we may not be able to provide all that is being asked of us.Our area manager, Emma Greenwood, who has been working non-stop to support the 26 food banks in the south-west, sends us a request. She wants to know how long we can continue to meet demand before current stock runs out. We estimate about six weeks.The Trussell Trust is working at a national level with supermarkets to secure corporate donations – so far, most of the large chains have announced multimillion-pound support packages – but we’re not sure how it will trickle down to inidual food banks and whether it will compensate for the drop in inidual donations that we saw last week.“I’m not sure how to put it into words,” she says when I ask her what the picture looks like across the region. “I’m just so bowled over and proud – and a little emotional. Everyone is essentially rewriting their operational model on a daily basis just to keep going. They’re all being so resilient – but then I guess that’s what food banks are about, isn’t it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63d1aaf37f137f059b275d99a6b3b15803bb6907/0_274_5822_3495/master/5822.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91a9d664c10e1ee7907afc5d7eea0064","title":"county cricketeers waive 1m prize money coronavirus cricket premiership rugby union","story":"Domestic cricketers in England have waived £1m in prize money as part of a deal brokered with the 18 first-class counties and the England and Wales Cricket Board.After a week of talks over the financial impact of Covid-19, the Professional Cricketers’ Association announced on Wednesday that an agreement to cover the months of April and May – the portion of the season already written off – has now been reached. More than half this year’s prize money has been ceded by the players, with the understanding that all contracts will adopt the latest terms and anyone released by their club at the end of the season – around 130 deals are said to be up – will get support.The union has also established that any pay cuts during the next two months will be “consistent with reductions made to other non-playing staff at their county” and said that any requests to furlough players in the short term will be accepted.The majority of counties are expected to make use of the government’s job retention scheme for their playing squads, with Essex, Leicestershire and Kent having now joined Yorkshire and Worcestershire as clubs to have confirmed this.Daryl Mitchell, the Worcestershire batsman who serves as the PCA chairman, said: “The understanding from our players and the willingness to help has been particularly heartening. Like many industries, cricket recognises the challenges it currently faces the players have been alert to the need for them to play their part.“The coronavirus pandemic will continue to put financial pressure on the game and this initial two-month agreement will support the game for the period of April and May.”Last week England’s centrally contracted men announced a joint £500,000 wage donation back to the ECB and selected “good causes”, while the women have taken pay cuts in line with those of their support staff.Meanwhile, Premiership Rugby has suspended this season indefinitely but still hopes to play it to a conclusion even though there are nine rounds of the regular campaign remaining and two play-off weekends. Last month the clubs paused the season for five weeks, hoping to resume at the end of next week, but there was no chance of that happening with the government expected to extend the lockdown beyond next Monday and players needing a couple of weeks in training to regain full fitness.Premiership Rugby’s board announced on Wednesday that the suspension would go beyond 24 April but did not set a date for when it aimed to restart the tournament, saying that first it would seek approval from the government and Public Health England.“The intention is to play all the games and complete the season as soon as it can be done safely,” Premiership Rugby said in a statement, although that would take three months and probably mean the start of next season being put back. “We are further postponing the current season and we are exploring with the Rugby Football Union opportunities to reschedule the Premiership final later in the year with a minimum of 2,500 tickets to be donated to NHS and essential workers.”“We have agreed on our approach to restart rugby after a series of constructive meetings with our clubs, investors, players’ representatives, commercial and broadcast partners and the Rugby Football Union,” said Premiership Rugby’s chief executive, Darren Childs. “This is not an easy conversation. We are dealing with a catastrophic pandemic that is unprecedented in our lifetimes, the effects of which are heartbreaking and devastating. We also must recognise that when the pandemic is finally at an end, there will still be an economic challenge for many years to come.“I am proud of how our clubs, staff and players have pulled together to make swift and dignified decisions to preserve the sustainability of their independent businesses in order to meet the challenges ahead. We are creatively working with the government and medical professionals to come back promptly, as soon as we know that it is safe to do so.”Premiership Rugby is looking at a number of potential restart dates. Government advisers have warned that the restriction on social gatherings is likely to continue for at least another three months, which would mean a resumption at the end of July at the earliest, even if matches were played behind closed doors. The new campaign starts in the middle of September and finishes with the Lions touring South Africa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6917e1300843f102e4f30e383e60573fe856d825/0_240_4666_2800/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=666f934eff5b0c54a210c44d2e46775c","title":"uka head pledges to hand over salazar farah report and seeks ethical success","story":"The new head of UK Athletics has said any employee who does not share her vision for “ethical success” will lose their job, and there are “definite plans” to hand over a 2015 internal report into Alberto Salazar’s relationship with Mo Farah.Joanna Coates was addressing the row between UK Anti-Doping and UKA, following the latter’s refusal to hand over the internal report which is said to contain sensitive medical data.“There are definitely plans to hand it over,” insisted Coates, who said UKA was not trying to delay the process but simply adhering to “certain processes and certain elements of confidentiality” that have to be upheld before the the information can be released.“We are an organisation that has been highly criticised for not following process and on this occasion we are absolutely following process and we’re still being criticised.”Coates also said there was a need for stronger leadership at UKA following revelations in a review by the sports barrister John Mehrzad of the organisation’s dealings with Salazarthat the former performance director Neil Black and the head of endurance, Barry Fudge, both threatened to quit if the board cut its ties with the American coach. Black left UKA in October, his exit due in no small part to his support of Salazar and his failure to hit medal targets at the World Athletics Championships. Fudge remains in his role.“Performance cannot dictate a business, that’s how I feel,” Coates said. “Major decisions should be made at an executive level and people should understand what’s happening in their business. We will be reviewing the entire organisation and seeing if people are fit for purpose to drive this business forward. I don’t want to name particular people because I don’t think it’s fair to do that.”Coates said that while she has some concerns, she is hopeful none of Salazar’s methods have been adopted by other coaches or athletes governed by UKA. “We have been reviewed and audited and reviewed again in so many different areas of the business that I truly hope that there are no skeletons in the cupboard,” she said.“We have an opportunity to write a strategy for the organisation based on very clear behaviour that I want to see exhibited. If there are people in the organisation that don’t feel that plan is right and don’t exhibit those behaviours then we will remove them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b169a0b3b992468ebfde8e7bf1ef2f62819f3ab1/563_241_2327_1396/master/2327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9f23e4975db1b25a897a80ef27be64","title":"incontinence how women are regaining bladder control","story":"Conversation around the side-effects of menopause is changing thanks to celebrities speaking out – so why do we still avoid talking about bladder weakness?Night sweats, mood swings – language around the menopause is all rather negative and even, some might say, derogatory. It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Sanders informed staff of the decision, which he called “difficult and painful”, during conference call on Wednesday morning.Though Sanders made clear that Biden would be the party’s next nominee – and that he would actively support the former vice-president – he said his name would remain on the ballot and he would continue to amass delegates in an effort to “exert significant influence” over the Democratic platform.“Together we have transformed the American consciousness as to what kind of nation we can become and have taken this country a major step forward in the never-ending struggle for economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice,” he told supporters, adding: “While this campaign is coming to an end, our movement is not.”After storming through the early primary voting states with strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire and a dominating victory in Nevada in February, the political momentum turned inexorably against Sanders as South Carolina revived Biden’s sputtering campaign. The state was also the beginning of the end for Sanders in 2016, during his first campaign for the Democratic nomination when he challenged Hillary Clinton. Though he fell short of the nomination, his insurgent candidacy reinvigorated the American left.For weeks, Sanders resisted calls to leave the race despite falling almost hopelessly behind his rival as the pandemic forced the candidates to retreat from the campaign trail and governors to delay several key primary elections. In the final weeks before his exit, Sanders effectively turned his campaign into a coronavirus response effort.He said the unprecedented public health crisis exposed the “cruelty and absurdity” of the American healthcare system, which he would like to see replaced by a Medicare for All program. But his efforts did not shift the political reality.Though the early days of the primary were shaped by a robust contest of ideas, Democrats’ overriding priority was not ideology but electability. In March the race abruptly narrowed from a historically erse field of candidates to two white men in their 70s. Suddenly fearful that a democratic socialist would jeopardize their chances against Trump in November, Democrats in states from Florida to Washington, Michigan to Texas aligned behind Biden, ultimately denying Sanders a path forward.Sanders called Biden a “very decent man” and said he would work together with the former vice-president to ensure Trump is defeated in November.In a lengthy statement, Biden said Sanders “hasn’t just run a political campaign, he’s created a movement” and thanked him for being a “powerful voice for a fairer and more just America”.“You will be heard by me,” Biden said, addressing the senator directly. “As you say: ‘Not me, us’” – which was the Sanders campaign motto.Trump also weighed in, ever eager to fan the flames of discord among Democrats. On Twitter, he blamed the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren for Sanders’ string of Super Tuesday defeats and suggested the party had conspired against Sanders.“The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party,” he wrote.Sanders, ever strongest in the role of underdog, fought his way back into contention after suffering a heart attack in October and was all but written out of the race. As Warren, an ideological ally turned rival, fell behind, Sanders consolidated support on the left and, for a time, was the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.But he only found success when his opponents were ided. Biden’s South Carolina win forced fellow centrists Amy Klobuchar and the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg out of the race. Both threw their support behind Biden, who then swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states, a hot streak that continued through March.The billionaire Mike Bloomberg quickly dropped out after that and endorsed Biden. Warren bowed out the following day but declined to endorse either candidate in what was viewed as a loss for Sanders.Perhaps no single candidate has done more to reshape the Democratic party in the past four years than Sanders.Issues he popularized in 2016 – from Medicare for All to the climate crisis – were the center of robust debates during the 2020 race. But his long-sought political revolution never quite arrived. Though Sanders made gains with Latino voters, he struggled to expand his appeal to black voters and young voters did not turn out in the numbers he hoped.“Your fight for progressive ideas moved the conversation and charted a path for candidates and activists that will change the course of our country and party,” Warren said on Twitter.Moderate Buttigieg, who sparred mightily with Sanders, called the senator a “tremendous force” in US politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0c584e4c6a8757e92bea1fb13b7e4d71","title":"coronavirus indigenous communities brazil yanomami","story":"Fifteen-year-old boy is one of seven indigenous Brazilians to test positive for coronavirus in three Amazon statesFears over the devastating impact coronavirus could have on South America’s indigenous communities have grown after a teenager from Brazil’s Yanomami people tested positive for the illness in the Amazon.The 15-year-old is reportedly being treated in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, the northern Brazilian state where much of the Yanomami reserve is located.The teenager was admitted last Friday complaining of chest pains, breathing difficulties and a sore throat and tested positive for the illness on Tuesday.Authorities say the boy – who is reported to have travelled back into the Yanomami reserve last month after classes at his school were suspended – is one of seven indigenous Brazilians to test positive for the coronavirus in three Amazon states: Pará, Amazonas and Roraima.Public health specialists have warned coronavirus could wreak havoc on indigenous groups in countries such as Brazil, Peru and Venezuela. Highly infectious diseases such as measles, smallpox and flu viruses have a long and horrific track record of decimating such communities.“If this virus gets into the villages it will cause a huge amount of death,” Sofia Mendonça, a Brazilian public health physician who works with indigenous communities, told the  recently.The Yanomami reserve – a vast expanse of rainforest larger than the island of Ireland - was created almost three decades ago in an attempt to protect them after tens of thousands of gold miners invaded their lands in the 1980s.Contact with those miners proved calamitous for the Yanomami: one in five are said to have died during that decade as a result of illness or violence.In recent years the gold miners and threats to Yanomami life have returned. Activists say 20,000 illegal prospectors are currently laying waste to their preserve while Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has vowed to allow commercial mining in such areas.The Amazônia Real website said Yanomami leaders suspected wildcat gold miners were responsible for bringing coronavirus into their 26,000-strong community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area covid 19","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

It also found that regime aircraft had bombed the same town with chlorine gas in the same week.The three attacks took place days before the infamous sarin gas attack on the nearby town of Khan Sheikhoun, which produced some of the most shocking images of the nine-year war and one of its most bitterly contested narratives.OPCW investigators found that the three Ltamenah attacks took place on 24, 25 and 30 March the first and third strikes were carried out by SU-22 jets and the second by a helicopter. All three aircraft launched from the nearby Shayrat airbase.The investigation determined the type of munitions used to deliver the poison gas, and the names and ranks of the Syrian officers who ordered the attacks, although it redacted their identities from the final report.The report said all alternative scenarios for the casualties, which affected more than 80 people, were considered, including whether the attacks had been staged. But they had been dismissed due to the weight of evidence supporting the finding that Syrian pilots had dropped sarin on the town on the orders of senior officers.In the aftermath of the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which killed 89 people, loyalists of the Syrian regime and the Russian government rushed to push a narrative that distressing scenes of dead and dying victims had been staged by rescuers. While not focusing on Khan Sheikhoun in this report, the OPCW said similar claims surrounding Ltamenah had been examined. It found that accounts from victims had been corroborated by interviews, which had also been supported by chemical analyses of samples retrieved from the sites.Jerry Smith, a former OPCW investigator, said the investigation was an important moment in an ongoing effort to bring to account perpetrators of war crimes in Syria.Until last year, the OPCW did not have the mandate to apportion blame for chemical attacks. However, a 2018 resolution called for the organisation to be given the right to do so, and the findings are the result of a new body within the organisation, known as the Investigation and Identification team.Hadi Al Khatib, founder and director of Syria Archive, said: “Now that the report has explicitly pointed to the Syrian government as the perpetrator of these attacks, strong cooperation between states is necessary to ensure that these atrocities are not met with impunity.“It is time for competent prosecutors to jointly investigate the Syria chemical weapons programme and issue arrest warrants against senior government officials in the Syrian regime.”Ltamenah, at the time of the attack, was an important logistical hub for opposition groups, who had in previous weeks launched devastating attacks against the regime-held city of Hama. Both Ltamenah and Khan Sheikhoun were used as a supply point for militias opposed to the Assad regime. With extensive help from the Russian Air Force, both towns have now been recaptured by Syrian and allied forces.Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0df3e6a0c1c747b2f6451abb8efbb304b055a0bf/0_316_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=799a532951fcc071e94d7c2f2631e289","title":"uk covid 19 lockdown to be extended beyond next week","story":"Ministers voice concern Easter weekend could see change in public behaviourDominic Raab is expected to signal that stringent lockdown measures must remain in place beyond next week, in the first key government decision to be taken while the prime minister remains in intensive care.The death toll from coronavirus is continuing to rise daily, with 938 UK fatalities announced on Wednesday – close to the highest daily figures reported in Italy and Spain. Medical experts are not expecting the peak to come for more than week.With the long Easter weekend looming, ministers are concerned that any suggestion of an imminent loosening of restrictions could result in an immediate change in the public’s behaviour. has learned that at least five police chief constables want the government to consider toughening coronavirus lockdown restrictions amid concerns that a growing minority will flout the rules over the bank holiday. Options for more stringent curbs include preventing people driving long distances and legislation to enforce the government’s order to limit exercise to once a day.Government sources suggested Raab, the foreign secretary deputising for Boris Johnson “where necessary”, would address the issue at Thursday’s Downing Street press conference – and prepare the public for an extension of the measures put in place on 23 March.Legislation to implement the measures dictates that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, must also oversee a formal review of their impact by next Thursday – and another within three weeks after that.Johnson, 55, was set to spend a third night in intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital in London on Wednesday night. While his condition was said to be improving – with Johnson able to sit up and talk to medics – Raab is now chairing the powerful four-man Covid-19 committee, which has continued to drive the government’s response to the crisis while the prime minister is in hospital.The group, effectively an inner cabinet that meets daily, also includes the cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, Hancock and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.On Tuesday, Raab declined to say whether a review of the restrictions would take place as planned next week, in the absence of Johnson. But the foreign secretary is expected to address the issue directly on Thursday, after a Cobra meeting in the morning – the first since the measures were imposed.Current restrictions oblige the public to remain at home unless they are exercising, shopping for essentials or going to a job that cannot be carried out at home.Pressure for clarity from the government intensified on Wednesday, as senior politicians from across the UK suggested the lockdown must remain in force.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said: “I think when the prime minister announced the lockdown just over two and half weeks ago, he said he would review it in three weeks’ time, which is this Monday. I think we’re nowhere near lifting the lockdown.In Northern Ireland, the communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, suggested the lockdown should remain in place “for the foreseeable future”.Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told an online meeting of the Welsh assembly: “We will not throw away the gains we have made, and the lives we can save, by abandoning our efforts just as they begin to bear fruit.”He added: “There is more work to do in reviewing the regulations. The precise nature of what will follow the current regime will be agreed over the coming days.”Nicola Sturgeon also said that Scotland is not expecting to see an end to the lockdown any time soon. It is understood that evidence to the Scottish government does not support the idea that the peak of cases or deaths is imminent north of the border, and the expectation in Holyrood is that rigorous physical distancing is likely to have to go on for 12-13 weeks.Sunak made clear at Wednesday’s press conference that the evidence is not yet available to enable politicians to lift the lockdown – and suggested formal confirmation of any extension may not come until next week. He said the Cobra meeting on Thursday would “talk about the approach to the review”.That message was underlined by the government’s deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Angela McLean, who said the government would need evidence about whether the entire “suite” of lockdown measures is working, before any decision to lift them could be made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e7239056a00fdfd98ef6bc8beeccf6cea8b31f/0_68_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d877acda8cafd824d4d718b104d66b18","title":"uk scrambles for foreign made ventilators ahead of coronavirus peak","story":"NHS has 10,000 available but needs 18,000 to deal with rising number of cases The NHS is scrambling to get foreign-made ventilators into hospitals, so that there are enough available ahead of the estimated peak in UK coronavirus cases in around seven to 10 days’ time.There are around 10,000 ventilators available to the NHS at present but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the UK needs 18,000 to be sure of dealing with the rising numbers of cases – prompting intense efforts to get more.Ministers had called on the private sector to build new ventilators as part of Ventilator Challenge UK, but it has taken time to build up the manufacturing of devices that also need regulatory approval before they can be used.As a result, immediate efforts to meet peak demand have focused on obtaining ventilators from established manufactures around the world, rather than new entrants signed up by ministers in the past three weeks.The Department of Health has secured another 1,500 “on order and due to arrive in the next fortnight” and officials “have been working rapidly to secure additional ventilator capacity through established UK suppliers and from overseas”.Earlier on Wednesday Downing Street confirmed that the UK had asked the US to deliver 200 ventilators already ordered from US companies, clarifying statements made the previous night by the US president, Donald Trump.The president said the UK had called the US with an urgent plea for the devices, although this was wrongly understood in some quarters to mean that Britain was seeking an emergency donation.“We’re going to work it out, we’ve got to work it out. They’ve been great partners. They wanted 200, they need them desperately,” Trump said.Downing Street said that the NHS had ordered ventilators from suppliers in several countries in the race to be prepared. “We have been sourcing ventilators from around the world and that includes the US,” the prime minister’s spokesman said.Sources at the Department of Health added that the extra steps taken would mean that the government remained confident the NHS would have enough ventilators available to meet patient demand in the critical coming days.That would meet a commitment given on Saturday by Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England. He said: “We have planned to stay ahead of capacity. I won’t give you a number in terms of our aim for ventilators … Our overall strategy is to keep capacity ahead of demand and we have successfully done that so far.”Ventilators are critical in keeping the most severely ill coronavirus patients alive, although the UK had only 5,000 of the medical devices available in the middle of March as the severity of the crisis became clear.That number increased to 8,175 last week and is now at around 10,000, boosted partly by taking over 1,000 from the private sector, which has now been effectively taken over by the NHS for the duration of the crisis. Around 480 have been obtained from abroad since March, it is understood.Civilian personnel have started delivering the ventilators, which are being briefly warehoused at a vast storage depot at the Ministry of Defence’s Donnington base in Shropshire, including 300 from Chinese firms.Military logistics experts have also embarked on delivery runs to hospitals that have asked for extra supplies. But UK specialist suppliers are traditionally used to making 50 to 60 a week, forcing the government to turn to imports, while other British firms step up their manufacturing and obtain regulatory approval.Ventilator Challenge UK, a consortium of engineering firms that has made the swiftest progress in manufacturing new machines, has already delivered several dozen of its new devices to Donnington.Other devices have been designed from scratch within weeks by firms including the manufacturer Dyson and defence firm Babcock. But several sources involved in the effort have previously told the  that, despite their best efforts, it will take weeks to reach maximum production.The machines that have arrived at hospitals this week are understood to include paraPac models made by Ventilator Challenge UK member Smiths Medical, which has pledged to provide up to 10,000 of them.While the paraPac is already approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), it is primarily intended to assist breathing during patient transport, such as in ambulances.Clearance is still required for 5,000 more heavy duty machines more suited to use in intensive care, made by Oxford-based Penlon, which is also part of the consortium.According to well placed sources, the MHRA is now performing the final clinical tests on Penlon’s design at hospitals around the country. The device, which involved tweaking an existing model, is expected to secure regulatory clearance soon.Airbus is helping Penlon ramp up its output by replicating the company’s production line at the Advanced Manufacturing Resource Centre in north Wales, where the aircraft manufacturer is the largest tenant.While manufacturers are battling to produce ventilators in time for the projected peak of cases, the government has ordered far more than the 30,000 that were initially called for by Boris Johnson.On top of the 10,000 ventilators the NHS already has, Babcock, Dyson and Cambridge-based Sagentia have each been asked to provide 10,000 newly designed models, although they all require regulatory approval and will need weeks to reach full production. Once all of those are manufactured and approved for use the NHS is likely to have many more ventilators than the 18,000 needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2661c89e7aa5ec016157d330a1628a3f2184abea/0_374_6048_3627/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd42984b448f84f5858cddca974999f","title":"wuhan ends coronavirus lockdown in pictures","story":"After 76 days sealed off from the world, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has opened its doors again.

Photograph: Domnick Walsh Some holiday homeowners in Kerry last weekend found gardaí at their door, inquiring where they were from and offering gentle encouragement to go back there.This weekend, gardaí under Supt Dan Keane, the most senior garda in Tralee and west Kerry, will be stopping new arrivals. But they will also be telling those already in situ to stay where they are.Beaches, caravan parks will be checked too, he told The , urging those with travel plans to abandon them: “People are going to their graves. You cannot avail of a holiday home in west Kerry or anywhere else.”Promising checkpoints around the county, Supt Keane said people will be ordered to turn back unless they can provide a satisfactory explanation why they are not covered by the temporary restrictions that last until Monday.Last weekend, gardaí who approached some holiday homeowners were told they had come down before the Government introduced travel restrictions and the 2km limit on March 27th.Those already in Kerry or elsewhere must now treat their holiday home as their primary residence for now, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has made clear.Reluctantly warning that prosecutions will follow for those who breach the regulations, Supt Keane said: “Clearly travelling to a holiday home or a caravan park or mobile home in Kerry or anywhere else is not essential travel.”The numbers coming to owned, or rented holiday homes have surged in recent weeks from Ventry to Valentia Island in ways that are “unusual for this time of year” and in ways that have frightened locals.Kerry has high numbers of second homes – 8,056 in 2016 and that only counted those unoccupied on census night. The county’s large number of mobile homes has to be added to this list also.Local concern has been growing for a fortnight, with west Kerry Cllr Séamus Cosai Fitzgerald demanding extra policing: “We have very limited medical resources in Kerry, especially in west Kerry.”Cahersiveen guesthouse owner Alan Landers, who like others in the town has closed his operation, said “a lot of strangers” had been noticed in the district in recent weeks.Local Irish Hotels Federation spokesman Pádraig McGillycuddy of Ballygarry House said:“All I know is people are coming to their holiday homes. We are closed. Everything is closed for the first time ever.”In Killarney, Paul Sherry, president of the local chamber of commerce, said bars, hotels and restaurants are closed: “The main focus is everyone comes through it well. Come when it is open again.”In west Cork, an anonymous letter writer to the Neil Prendeville Show on Cork’s Red FM claimed the number of English- and Dublin-registered cars between Skibbereen and Ballydehob has increased sharply in recent days.Checking their satnavOne English couple pulled up in his driveway to check on their satnav, with the female driver getting out to chat. “I asked her to get back into her car and open the window to me. She threw her eyes to heaven and mumbled under her breath. I informed them that we were on 2km lockdown in this country and that we are taking it seriously here. She told me she was safe and healthy and not to be panicking like the rest of west Cork,” said the writer, adding that the couple then asked where Olympic rowers Paul and Gary O’Donovan lived so they could get a photograph with them.“We don’t need or want these silly people that come around here that don’t understand what we are trying to do – we are trying to protect ourselves, our parents and our neighbours, particularly vulnerable ones that have cancer.”In Donegal, gardaí stopped hundreds of cars crossing from Bridgend in Derry. Some were allowed to pass, but others were turned back. The same happened with Derry-bound traffic.Tempers have frayed in Donegal in recent days with the numbers of Northern tourists arriving, or those coming from elsewhere in the Republic who had been intent on an Easter weekend away.Urging those who had planned to travel to Donegal for Easter not to come, local Sinn Féin TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said: “You will be welcomed back with open arms when this all passes.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221960.1586170700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s just stuff doctor leaves all possessions behind in australia to return to work in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Marianne Hennigan at Dublin Airport on Saturday. Photograph: Ireland’s CallThe world has changed completely since Dr Marianne Hennigan started a four-week holiday in New Zealand in mid-March. Then, governments were waking up to the reality of Covid-19, but it was still a disease mostly confined to China and Europe and not to Australia and New Zealand.Nobody expected the raft of restrictions which would shut down the world in the space of a few weeks. Within a week of her arrival in New Zealand, the bus tour was cancelled and she, along with others on the tour, was forced to self-isolate in Auckland. Dr Hennigan (31), originally from Deansgrange, Co Dublin, was working in Perth at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a locum doctor in emergency medicine. Like hundreds of other Irish newly-qualified doctors she found the opportunities and the climate in Perth agreeable and had spent three years there. Her flight back to Perth from Auckland was abruptly cancelled with no replacement available. In this hiatus, she made up her mind not to go back to Perth at all, but leave her car and her possessions there and return to Ireland to work. “In the end of the day it’s just stuff. I really enjoyed working in Perth,” she said. “It was lovely, the biggest thing that I regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to any of my friends when I left. I’m sure I will at some point. Unfortunately, none of us really expected what was going to happen.” Her marathon flight home, first to Doha in Qatar, and then to Ireland was facilitated by the Ireland’s Call Initiative which is not to be confused with On Call for Ireland, the HSE call for healthcare professionals, students and volunteers to help tackle coronavirus in Ireland. The Ireland’s Call Initiative was set up by businessman Neil Sands as a philanthropic enterprise to bring doctors and nurses home from abroad and to pay for their flights and accommodation in self-isolation for a fortnight. Ireland’s Call hopes to bring home 100 Irish medics from abroad in the coming months. She is the first to be repatriated under the initiative and one of more than 50,000 people who have offered their services to the HSE since last month. “We are not the real heroes,” she stressed. “The real heroes are the people who have been there from day one. We are the reinforcements. “I am delighted to be home. I was particularly happy to see my mum at the airport. It is just a relief to be coming home for the foreseeable future and that I won’t be stuck. “The main fear is that working in ICU, where it is high-risk, if I were to get sick, my family wouldn’t be able to come out to see me in Perth. At this time you want to be in proximity with your family and around Irish people.” She will need the next fortnight to register for and find work. Her experience in emergency respiratory medicine in Perth will be invaluable for her and for the HSE as it seeks to cope with the pandemic. There will be other business to attend to and making a will is something she feels is necessary given the risks involved. “I think everybody is fearful at this point in time when you see young healthcare workers getting sick and dying,” she said. “It is obvious that I didn’t intend to do it at this stage of my life. It is our profession and it is something that I want to help out. I would much rather be in the front line helping out than being stuck in another country in an Airbnb.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223951.1586346494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin raises need for end point of coronavirus restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has told a party meeting that the public may need to be told when the restrictions introduced to deal with the coronavirus crisis will be lifted.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe country’s largest public service union has instructed special needs assistants (SNAs) not to co-operate with any reassignment as part of the Government’s overall plans for tackling Covid-19 other than to remote support roles to assist students with special educational needs.It said the instruction to members was necessary “due to the lack of clarity on what other duties may be required outside of the home, and also due to the need to ensure that SNAs can only be asked to work safely”.The union said on Wednesday that the Department of Education and Skills should ensure that children with special educational needs were properly supported during the coronavirus crisis.Fórsa, which represents over 9,000 special needs assistants (SNAs), said it feared “ the Department’s approach to the deployment of SNAs during the crisis risks exacerbating the educational disadvantage that children with special educational needs experience”.The union said teachers – the largest group of staff working in schools – “have generally remained focused on providing educational supports to their students at this time”.It added: “SNAs should similarly be deployed to support the students they normally work with –- students who, by definition, have special needs not experienced by the wider school community. Fórsa maintains this can best be done by SNAs.”There had been suggestions from the union a couple of weeks ago that SNAs could be redeployed to work as part of the contact tracing service with the HSE.However the union said on Wednesday that “confusion and poor communication from the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE over Garda vetting and the potential reallocation of SNAs to other roles in the HSE has spread concerns that they may be assigned to work with vulnerable elderly people”.Medical consultants“These are roles that the vast majority of SNAs are neither qualified for, nor experienced in.”It is understood that the union received a large number of representations from SNAs who were concerned that they could be moved to healthcare facilities as part of the Government’s initiative to redeploy staff across the public service as part of its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.Separately the HSE said on Wednesday that discussions were continuing regarding moves to bring several hundred private sector medical consultants into the public system to increase capacity to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.Many private consultants have expressed concern at what would happen to their existing patients if they signed up to the public-only contract put forward by the Government at the weekend.The HSE declined for a second day in a row to set out how many of the 500-600 private consultants had signed the new contract .The Irish Hospital Consultants Association has urged members not to sign the proposed contract pending clarifications being secured.A number of informed sources have suggested that the Government may look at revising some of its proposals to deal with the continuity of care for existing patients.

File photograph: Joseph Eid AFPGettyThe coronavirus lockdown has confined many of us to our homes and, if we are lucky, to our back gardens.While human nighttime activity has been severely curtailed, the sky above continues in its imperturbable way.Spring is a great time to be out of doors and looking up at the heavens. There are two caveats. The first is the weather in Ireland which is an occupational hazard for any amateur or professional astronomer. By some estimates just one night a week is completely cloud-free though you should see lots in partially clouded skiesDo make the best of any clear weather that comes along. Ideally, you need to stay out for at least 20 minutes to allow your eyes to adapt to the darkness. You will see a lot more than if you take a quick peek outside or out the window.The other scourge of astronomers is light pollution. In built-up areas light can obscure some of the glories of the heaven most notably the Milky Way. The more rural the location, the more you will see, while sticking to the current coronavirus restrictions of course.Nevertheless, most of the sky’s most prominent objections can be seen even in light polluted skies.Skygazing for beginners is much easier than it used to be. There are a multiplicity of apps that will show you around the sky - we have been using Sky Guide, available on Apple and Android. All you have to do is point your smartphone upwards. Nevertheless, it is good to know what you are looking at.Fortunately, there is much of interest to be seen with the naked eye and with binoculars. These objects can be seen using either. You will need a small telescope to see details on the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars which are in the morning sky during the month of April.Moon: The supermoon is quite the sight in the skies this week. The moon’s surface is made up of mountains, craters and “seas” which flat, grey shaped areas which were made when molten lava cooled when the moon was created.The most discernible feature with the naked eye is the figure of eight feature slightly right of centre of the moon. The top part of the eight is the Sea of Serenity and the bottom half is the Sea of Tranquillity. The Sea of Tranquillity is where first moon landing landed on the moon in 1969.Near the bottom of the full moon is the huge crater Tycho which is just about discernible with the naked eye, but is very much visible even in a small pair of binoculars. This is a spray crater which resulted after a huge asteroid struck the moon during its formation. Another crater which is visible slightly above Tycho is Copernicus.VENUS: Venus will be the star of the heavens so to speak for the next month. It is unmistakable as it blazes away in the southern sky from 8.30pm. It looks like a star, but is a planet. If you look through binoculars its light is constant while stars twinkle. A small telescope will reveal that Venus has phases like the moon and can sometimes appear as a crescent.THE PLOUGH: Known also as the Big Dipper, the Plough is the asterism (star pattern) in the sky that everybody knows. It is not a constellation in itself as it forms part of Ursa Major, the Big Bear.The Plough is most distinguished by the mid-star in the handle which is actually a double star (two stars that orbit each other). It used to be a test of visual acuity if you could see two stars not one. They are Alcor and Mizar also known as the horse and rider and they are easily resolvable in a pair of binoculars.POLARIS: The two stars on the pan end of the Plough point directly to Polaris, the North Star. This is the most important star in the sky. It points due north and navigators used it for millennia to determine their longitude. For instance observed from Dublin it is at an angle of 53 degrees to the horizon but at the North Pole it will be directly overhead. It is always in the same place in the sky and the Vikings believed it was a spike around which the universe revolved. In 2008 Nasa sent a radio signal of The Beatles’ Across the Universe in the direction of Polaris. Do not be holding your breath wishing for a response. The message will take 431 years to reach the star and, assuming there is any intelligent life on some of the planets around Polaris, another 431 years for the message to return to Earth.Orion:  Orion, the hunter, is the jewel of the night in the southern sky. Unlike a lot of other constellations, it actually looks like what it is named after. Orion is distinguished by its belt of three diagonal stars. Underneath is a fuzzy patch of sky called the Orion nebula which can be seen clearly in a pair of binoculars. This is a star formation area.In the top left hand corner of Orion is the super red star Betelgeuse. This is one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye. It may not even exist any longer. In February Nasa scientists observed that it had dimmed considerably. This is an indication that it is about to reach the end of its life and blow up into a supernova. That might have already happened. As it takes 700 years for the light from Betelgeuse to reach Earth, we might not know about it yet. Then again it might not blow up for another 100,000 years. Nobody knows for certain when it will erupt into a supernova.Rigel:  At the opposite end to Betelgeuse is the blue supergiant Rigel which is 70 times as big as our sun. Stars vary in colour according to their age and Rigel is another star near the end of its life.Sirius: To the bottom left of Orion is Sirius, the Dog Star, which is the brightest star in the sky. It’s so bright because it is very close in astronomical terms being just 8.6 light years away from Earth. This is all relative given the distances involve. Sirius is 80 trillion kilometres away that’s 80,000,000,000,000 kilometres from Earth. We will not be going there any time soon.The Pleiades: The Pleiades, to the top right hand side of Orion, looks like a fuzzy patch in the sky to the naked eye, but reveal its full glory in a pair of binoculars. With a pair, you can discern a cluster six stars shining through the cosmic gas and dust. This is a star formation nursery where new stars are formed from the cosmic gases surrounding the six stars.Leo: The constellation of Leo (not to be confused with the astrological sign) dominates the spring sky. This is another constellation which looks like what it is supposed to resemble which is a crouching lion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224436.1586379677!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trinity to set up covid 19 research centre","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Covid-19 Research Hub will be located at Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute. The Covid-19 Research Hub will be located at Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute.Trinity College Dublin is to set up a Covid-19 research hub that will focus on the most urgent scientific breakthroughs needed to address the current pandemic including design of new drugs and a vaccine to combat the virus.The hub will work with doctors from St James’s Hospital, Dublin, other hospitals in Ireland, and established research partners around the world.It will also work on development of rapid antibody testing capacity to identify current and previous Covid-19 infection in healthcare workers, and eventually the wider community. This will be critical to determining if doctors and nurses can return to frontline services after infection by the virus, and to informing any easing of lockdown restrictions in the general population. The problem of supply and validation of commercial antibody testing kits will also be on its research agenda, as numerous test kits coming on to global markets are proving to be inaccurate.Prof Kingston Mills, who is co-leading the project, underlined the importance of investigating “the immune response in infected and recovered Covid-19 patients to establish whether previous infection prevents reinfection, including serial sampling of patients at St James’s Hospital and other collaborating hospitals”.The Covid-19 Research Hub will be located at Trinity’s biomedical sciences institute, and led by immunologists there and infectious disease clinicians from St James’s Hospital. Immune responsesAs foundation partner, AIB has committed €2.4 million to advance the project while the hub will continue to accept contributions from other public and private sources.Prof Mills said the research would concentrate on the immune responses to the virus in infected and recovered patients. “This will provide key information for the design of vaccines and immunotherapeutic drugs for controlling the often fatal inflammation in Covid-19 patients, and will assist in developing and validating new assays for detecting antibody responses to the virus, thereby identifying those who are ‘immune’ and therefore safe to return to work.”According to AIB chief executive Colin Hunt: “In the face of this unprecedented medical, societal and economic crisis, it is imperative that we mobilise all the resources at our disposal in a strategic way. We are investing in a national and international endeavour to save lives. Trinity ranks in the top 1 per cent of research institutions globally in medicine and biological sciences, and its immunologists collaborate with the best internationally.” The initiative will also involve the expertise of leading immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill.University laboratoriesTCD provost Patrick Prendergast said the solution to the Covid-19 crisis would probably be found in university laboratories in the months ahead following collaboration between leading researchers across the globe. “Trinity is one of the world’s leading universities when it comes to research into immunology and immunity and has the research expertise to play a major role. Donations such as this are a generous, practical and timely contribution to the fight against this terrible virus,” he said.Prof Aideen Long, director of Trinity’s translational medicine institute, is the other co-leader, while consultant immunologist Niall Conlon consultant physician in infectious diseases Colm Bergin professor of translational immunology Padraic Fallon and consultant Clíona Ní Cheallaigh will all play key roles. The project will also benefit from Trinity’s global network of collaborations and contacts in universities such as MIT in Boston and Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and with Public Health England, “so knowledge is shared and breakthroughs on Covid-19 are as effective and swift as possible”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224393.1586373909!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"this time the future of the euro really is at stake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister   attends a debate in the House of Representatives on the developments surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic   in The Hague, the Netherlands. Photograph: Bart MaatEPAIt took 16 hours of video conferencing for the finance ministers of the euro zone to find out that once again, they could not agree.As the ministers and their aides emerged blearily out into the sunlight of Wednesday morning in their respective capitals, the mood was pitch black. “I think I would summarise it by saying positions haven’t changed, but the mood has changed, and the mood has gotten worse,” an official said.One dream of what the future of Europe might look like was already over: the idea that it could be shaped by the so-called New Hanseatic League.Called the Hansa for short, this collection of the Netherlands, Ireland, and Baltic and Scandinavian states was brought together by the departure of Britain from the European Union. As a group, it hoped to replace the UK’s clout on economic matters and defend a trade-friendly, pro-business viewpoint.Ireland left it by joining the call of nine states including, Italy, Spain and France, for joint debt issuance in the form of eurobonds or coronabonds.The northern gang was never a perfect fit for Ireland anyway. But the attitude of the Netherlands in the past few days of negotiations has made the departure final.DisasterIreland, in tune with southern states, has been appalled by The Hague’s staunch blocking of proposals to dig European economies out of disaster and debt spiral caused by the pandemic.In the Netherlands, jointly-backed debt is commonly likened to taking over your neighbour’s mortgage, an unfair characterisation that draws on an old misapprehension that the euro zone bailouts were gifts from Dutch and German taxpayers, rather than loans repaid with interest. Naturally, the Irish view is more nuanced.But it’s not just joint debt. Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra was also the last man blocking a proposal to allow states to borrow from the bailout fund without the condition that they must balance the books.Germany was once the champion of this view that indebted countries can’t be given easy money because they won’t learn their lesson. But Berlin sees the pandemic as different to crises of the past, and objects to joint debt more on the grounds that rushing into such a commitment, like a Las Vegas marriage, might end badly.It was the vote of a party with 19 seats in the Dutch parliament, the europhile D66 party, that confirmed to international observers that a different reality held within the borders of the lowland state. By joining much of the opposition to back Mark Rutte’s government’s rejection of joint debt, the party sank international hopes the prime minister might come under domestic pressure to cave.Some officials believe the Dutch will come in time to see that the stakes are high for them too. But not until it has become clear that the euro itself is under threat, great economic damage has been wreaked, and seeds of bitterness between EU countries have been sown deep.The great fear is that by then it will be too late to turn back a tide of disgust in Italy towards the entire EU project.The Italian economy has hardly grown since it joined the euro in 1999. You can take your pick of domestic problems to blame: onerous laws that people ignore, a musical-chairs succession of weak governments, an aging population.But the fact is that the country has not seen the benefits of the euro. It has people old enough to vote who have known only economic stagnation. That’s despite the country’s continued strengths in manufacturing, science, and culture, and it being one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.Radicalised public opinionOver the course of two decades of using the euro Italy has turned from one of Europe’s most europhile nations to one of its most eurosceptic. The political results of this were already apparent with the country’s election of euro-critical parties into power.\u0026nbspBut the coronavirus pandemic appears to have radicalised public opinion.Since EU countries failed to respond to an appeal from Rome for emergency supplies, Italian media has been a maelstrom slights and wounds from fellow EU countries. Some are real, some spurious, but all are deeply felt as they were accompanied by gruesome death tolls of close to 1,000 a day.The blunt Dutch rejections seem to come from another universe, never mind from the same currency area.In the past, joint debt has been proposed as a solution to a structural flaw in the euro, which is a single currency, used by very different economies, that do not agree enough or share enough power to fix the deep imbalances this creates.In the past, those imbalances were addressed only when they came close to bringing the whole project crashing down.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178What happens to coronavirus patients in intensive care - and why is Boris Johnson there?Coronavirus latest news: Donald Trump says WHO got pandemic \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 and insists US has been treated unfairlyWho is Boris Johnson’s deputy with the Prime Minister in intensive care?Boris Johnson in intensive care for coronavirus – everything we know on Wednesday afternoonNo end to lockdown in sight as UK coronavirus deaths rise by 938 in a day\u0026#39Portable priest\u0026#39 leads mobile services as churches close despite lockdownMurder victim\u0026#39s family plead for help to catch killer on the 25th anniversary of her brutal deathArchbishop of Canterbury says Jesus is \u0026#39quite up to date\u0026#39 with technology and urges churches to stay closedLord Darroch says Donald Trump is \u0026#39one of most lethal politicians in modern era\u0026#39Madrid region may have many more coronavirus deaths than Spanish government is reportingHuman encroachment on animal habitats risks more global pandemics, study saysDuke and Duchess of Cambridge join school\u0026#39s Easter \u0026#39show and tell\u0026#39 for lockdown royal visitIntensive care nurses looking after six times more patients because of coronavirusPolice force threatens to fine Easter bank holiday visitors to beauty spotsCoronavirus lockdown could be in place until MayDomestic abuse victims can breach lockdown rules, says police chiefComment: Only one question matters to the Cabinet now: what would Boris do?Scotland’s chief medical officer quits after flouting lockdown advice -  readers have their sayUrgent tests in hospitals amid fears that coronavirus oxygen demand is leading to shortageWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown could place may","story":"Ministers are expected to delay making an announcement on how and when to lift the lockdown, concerned about arriving at a decision while Boris Johnson remains in intensive care.The Government is understood to be working on a plan to extend the measures until next month as the rising death toll means scientific advisers are still unsure when the peak will be.The UK daily death toll was 938 on Wednesday, the highest so far, bringing the total to 7,097.But ministers were said to be reluctant about making an important decision on such a key matter with the Prime Minister spending a fourth night in hospital, and a third in intensive care.In a Cabinet conference call after Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital, it is understood that there was little discussion of an exit strategy from the lockdown, with the focus still on tackling the spread of virus.Mr Johnson was on Wednesday night spending his third night in intensive care at St Thomas’ Hospital in central London, No 10 said, adding that he “continues to make steady progress”.Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told a 10 Downing Street press briefing that Mr Johnson “has been sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team”.Announcing the lockdown on March 23, Mr Johnson told the nation in a televised address: “I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to.”Since then the pledge has been made repeatedly by ministers or other public officials.Before being taken to hospital, it is understood that Mr Johnson was among one of the strongest advocates in Government for keeping the lockdown as short as possible, for fear of damaging the economy.Easter Monday marks the end of the initial three weeks, and legislation states that the Government has until Thursday next week to review formally the lockdown. However, ministers are now understood to be planning to make the decision as late as possible next week in a move that would allow Mr Johnson time to recover further and communicate his wishes.On Wednesday, other developed nations began setting out strategies to come out of lockdown.On mainland Europe, Denmark announced primary schools would reopen from April 15, and Austria said small shops and garden centres could open their doors again from April 14.Yet the UK Government has refused to reveal any details of its plan. It is likely that any extension announcement will also be accompanied with some details of the next steps to relax controls.One government source said: “There has been quite a lot of polling done within government which suggests that the public is opposed to the restrictions being lifted too soon, because we are not quite at that plateau yet. Also, the polling suggests people are largely behind the Government cracking down on those who flout the rules.“So there won’t be a reassessment at the end of the three weeks as planned. It’s just going to carry on while the experts carry on analysing the figures.”One Cabinet minister said: “It is realistically going to carry on until the end of the month – but we have got to start moving that forward, to get the economy moving again in May … or we are going to bankrupt ourselves.”A government source said the debate in Whitehall was now more between “status quo and enhancement, than it was between status quo and relaxation”.Asked if the Government would announce an extension before the three-week period ended on Monday, one senior former Tory minister said: “There has to be something in the next few days – maybe they are waiting for Boris.” However, there was further uncertainty yesterday when Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, said the capital was “nowhere near lifting the lockdown” while the Welsh government said the measures “will stay in place next week”.Opposition parties and business leaders called for clarity on Wednesday night. John Longworth, the former head of the British Chambers of Commerce and chairman of the Independent Business Network, said: “We need clarity as soon as possible so business can begin to plan for recovery. The cost both in human terms and to the economy mean that the cure is worse than the disease.”Layla Moran, a senior Liberal Democrat MP, added: “To give business the certainty it needs, the Government should be clear on if it is mindful to extend now, which looks likely, and allow business owners to continue to plan for how they are going save jobs.”The economic downturn and disruption to usual NHS services was also likely to “hit health hard”, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies warned. The health impact of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic would be felt “long after” the lockdown ended, it said. However, asked to “level” with the public on whether the lockdown would be continued, Mr Sunak said the review would be based on evidence and data “available next week” so he would rather not “speculate about the future”.Dominic Raab, the acting prime minister, will convene a Cobra meeting in the Cabinet Office on Thursday to brief the leaders of the devolved regions about “the approach to the review” of the lockdown, he added.Asked about the likelihood of schools reopening before the summer holidays, Prof Angela McLean, the Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, said officials were “thinking about all sorts of things we might do in the next stage” but declined to give further details.   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/04/02/TELEMMGLPICT000228607538_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"covid 19 has exposed folly one size fits all health service","story":"The NHS has responded brilliantly in some ways, yet the combination of a centralised structure with a one-size-fits-all mentality has crowded out non-state bodiesThe news that the Prime Minister is being treated on an ordinary NHS ward rather than at a top private hospital doubtless came as a shock to Donald Trump. The President, quite sincerely, offered experimental treatments from American drug companies to aid the PM’s recovery. Unsurprisingly, in a country whose citizens tend to view both Mr Trump and any mention of private healthcare with suspicion, Downing Street quickly declined his overtures.It may seem trivial, but the decision to treat the PM on a public ward, despite his obvious importance, reflects the core ethos of British healthcare – an uncompromising commitment to fairness which, though noble in theory, often proves a punishing straitjacket in practice. The spread of coronavirus has sadly exposed the destructive power of this ideology on our collective health.So far, only a few thousand of the 500,000 frontline NHS workers have been tested for Covid-19, though the Government has pledged to boost this number dramatically. Absurdly, internal caps on the numbers of NHS staff who could be tested remained in place until just a few days ago. The fact that one in four doctors is now thought to be off sick or self-isolating – many will not be infected – shows the folly of this strategy. They, like the PM, are vital to the national effort. The case for preferential treatment could not be stronger.The NHS has responded brilliantly in some ways particularly in ramping up intensive care capacity. Yet the combination of a centralised structure with a one-size-fits-all mentality has crowded out non-state bodies, to potentially lethal effect.A damning report from the Adam Smith Institute accuses the UK of lagging on testing due to the refusal of Public Health England to sanction private sector outsourcing. In one example, a group of researchers volunteered to run testing equipment, yet were spurned amid legal concerns about manning NHS facilities. Meanwhile, countries which immediately sought private sector assistance such as South Korea and Germany, with its decentralised healthcare structure, are now testing on a mass scale.Many hospitals report shortages of protective equipment, even though the Government says there is enough to go around. Who is responsible? Though NHS managers must take some of the logistical flak, it also points to the perils of complex bureaucracy, the difficulty of creating a top-down service that can react nimbly to local demand. Alarming reports of hospitals discontinuing cancer treatments in order to focus on Covid-19 reflect this fundamental inflexibility, too. NHS defenders may argue that hospitals cannot and should not operate like businesses, yet when comparing how supermarkets have grappled with this crisis, this no longer sounds like such a terrible proposition.Every Thursday, I have applauded the bravery of NHS workers who are putting themselves at great risk on the nation’s behalf. But I refuse to clap for a health service that demands uncritical respect and obedience. For too long, mindless adulation has silenced vital discussions of systemic failure.

I’m usually inured to the awful, and had half been expecting something like this all day, but this was different. It felt personal. There was Carrie and his family. It was also almost incomprehensible, a case of cognitive dissonance: how could such a gregarious, indomitable figure be felled in such a way? How could it be that our PM, of all world leaders, ended up worst affected, in the midst of our Dunkirk?The political and practical impacts have been seismic. Johnson’s worldview, instincts and personality make him the best possible leader to battle the coronavirus crisis, and his presence at the top of the (digital) Cabinet table is sorely missed. The Government’s performance these past 10 days would have been significantly improved had he – and his adviser Dominic Cummings, also badly affected but now recovering – been in full control.It is imperative, therefore, that Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, begins every meeting with a simple question to the rest of the Cabinet: What would the boss be doing in our place? How would he be imposing his will on Whitehall? How can we try to do as he would?The first order of business for those now wearing Johnson’s shoes is that the Cabinet should urgently be mapping out an exit strategy from the lockdown, as announced in other countries. Fatalities are surging to unbearable levels, but the peak will hopefully be reached soon, and after that the situation will look less atrocious. The lockdown can’t last very long, or else the country will be plunged into a crisis that could take decades to fix. Johnson, a freedom lover, understands this intuitively the rest of the public sector establishment, not so much.But this must be accompanied by a plan to contain and annihilate the coronavirus. Which shops should reopen first, and when should school restart? Should the vulnerable be told to continue to self-isolate, and the young allowed back first? What about mass tracing? Or “immunity passports”? It’s about sustainability, but also speed: the economy is collapsing.If Johnson were around, all of this would surely be on the agenda. We cannot afford “adaptive triggering”, regular returns to partial or total lockdowns if the virus surges back over the next 18 months until a vaccine is developed (why so long?). This would rob business of certainty, destroy investment and ensure a debilitating L-shaped recovery.The next way in which Johnson’s presence is missed is in his dealings with the machinery of state. The logistical failures surrounding personal protective equipment, the stunning lack of urgency over testing and the hopeless inability of the Treasury and HMRC to deliver help quickly confirm that the UK is sorely lacking in “state capacity”. That, for years, was exactly the CummingsJohnson critique. State structures reward incompetence and unresponsiveness the performance of Public Health England (PHE), in particular, has been disgraceful. The armed forces are the only exception: their ability to help build NHS Nightingale was awe-inspiring.So what would Johnson and Cummings be doing? Change must be rammed through. The Treasury should be given another kicking. PHE should be stripped of its broader responsibilities, which should be handed to a senior business figure. It should then be given a massive budget, and told to do whatever it takes to turbocharge testing to millions a day as soon as possible, procure ten times more protective equipment (first for the NHS but then for the rest of society) and drastically speed up vaccine research. Land must be found and factories built and tooled in a matter of days. It is madness that the private sector, which has performed superbly with ventilators in particular, isn’t being allowed to help more. It should be leveraged to the maximum, as in America, where Apple’s supply chain is procuring millions of masks.In an act of monumental generosity, Bill Gates is spending billions to build factories for the seven most promising potential vaccines, even though each can only make one particular variety, at least five will turn out to be duds and therefore most of the cash will be wasted: he wants production to commence as soon as the first vaccine gets signed off, so is hedging his bets. Why aren’t we doing the same? There isn’t enough supply, from protective kit to potential palliative drugs, so why not build more capacity in Britain?Lord Bethell’s appointment as minister for testing was a good idea, but even more is needed. Somebody such as the brilliant Lord Wolfson, boss of Next, should be brought in alongside him as CEO in charge of production, procurement and logistics, tasked with making everything from masks to vaccines, with just one mission: every day counts. This would be the ultimate Johnsonian grand projet.Last but not least, “following the science” is hard. Does it make sense to close schools? A UCL study says no others disagree. Should we wear masks? Many scientists now believe so ours don’t. In early January, the Government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group deemed the risk to the UK to be “very low” by January 21, it was still “low”, as an investigation from Reuters reveals. Experts can get it terribly wrong. To govern is to choose.On Monday night, my family prayed, in our different ways, for the PM to get well. In times such as these, and in such a theologically important week in particular, religion offers one possible refuge from the now obviously idiotic and delusional modernist view that we were on a holiday from history, a new, rationalist and especial invincible mutation of homo sapiens.The reality is that nothing essential ever changes. Easter, for Christians, signifies rebirth Passover, for the Jews, miraculous deliverance and freedom from oppression. The enumeration of the ten plagues is one of the most striking parts of the Seder, eerily apposite this year. There will be an end to this nightmare too, but the modern world will forever have lost its innocence.Coronavirus latest news: Donald Trump says WHO got pandemic \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 and insists US has been treated unfairlyWho is Boris Johnson’s deputy with the Prime Minister in intensive care?Boris Johnson in intensive care for coronavirus – everything we know on Wednesday afternoonNo end to lockdown in sight as UK coronavirus deaths rise by 938 in a day\u0026#39Portable priest\u0026#39 leads mobile services as churches close despite lockdownMurder victim\u0026#39s family plead for help to catch killer on the 25th anniversary of her brutal deathArchbishop of Canterbury says Jesus is \u0026#39quite up to date\u0026#39 with technology and urges churches to stay closedLord Darroch says Donald Trump is \u0026#39one of most lethal politicians in modern era\u0026#39Madrid region may have many more coronavirus deaths than Spanish government is reportingHuman encroachment on animal habitats risks more global pandemics, study saysDuke and Duchess of Cambridge join school\u0026#39s Easter \u0026#39show and tell\u0026#39 for lockdown royal visitIntensive care nurses looking after six times more patients because of coronavirusPolice force threatens to fine Easter bank holiday visitors to beauty spotsCoronavirus lockdown could be in place until MayDomestic abuse victims can breach lockdown rules, says police chiefScotland’s chief medical officer quits after flouting lockdown advice -  readers have their sayExclusive: Three nurses forced to wear bin bags because of PPE shortage test positive for coronavirus Westminster school in row over fee refunds to parents while furloughing staffUrgent tests in hospitals amid fears that coronavirus oxygen demand is leading to shortageWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/radio/2020/04/07/TELEMMGLPICT000228396841_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7C1dfzOy84m5qfVkJnI0sEM.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"schools key ending lockdown","story":"Children are generally at low risk of coronavirus and we should work to get them back in the classroomThere are huge costs to keeping children at home for little appreciable gain in fighting coronavirusCommon sense would tell us that closing schools is an essential part of the lockdown to combat coronavirus. We know that illnesses can spread in schools, and we commonly view children as good spreaders of dirt and disease. We also want to protect our children, and closing schools will feel like the safest course of action for those of us who are able to practise social distancing and who can control who we and our families see. Back when the Government suggested that adults should work from home but schools were still open (only a month ago now, but it feels like an age), people found it difficult to understand why they might be changing their routines but their children were not. However, common sense isn’t always entirely right. Emerging data on Covid-19 and evidence from the 2003 Sars epidemic tells us that schoolchildren probably play only a relatively minor role in disease transmission, and that closing schools is relatively insignificant in reducing coronavirus transmission. Yes, it’s important to say that it’s very early days and we don’t have a lot of data, but what data we do have suggests that schools aren’t the big players many have assumed. We also know that schools have stayed open in some of the countries that have had the most success in controlling Covid-19, such as Taiwan.So why is it that school closures don’t seem to have the impact we might think? There are many unanswered questions, but partly it appears to be because children are not big transmitters of coronavirus infections. Additionally, the impact of closure is limited by increases in social contacts between children out of school and increased contact between children and adults. This is particularly a problem with child-grandparent contacts. The other part of the equation is the very real harm that school closures bring to children and families. This is not just about the loss of education – although that is a huge issue. It is also the isolation of children from the support they get at school – from the school system and from teachers and friends. This is particularly true of children and young people who are vulnerable or who have special needs, and particularly those from the poorest sections of our society. I absolutely support the Government’s decision to close schools as part of the very stringent set of social distancing measures we are calling the “lockdown”. Every part of society has a role to play in combating this menace, and when we are staring down the barrel of the gun it is essential to put in place every bit of social distancing we can. However, this lockdown can’t last forever, and we must think carefully about how we open up society in a safe and evidence-based way. Schools are shut now but this doesn’t mean that it will always be the best option. We must explore ways of them reopening more fully. For some students, a combination of social distancing and education could be a viable option. School start times and finish times could be staggered, as could break times. There is also much more that could be done to minimise extensive social contact in the context of schools reopening, perhaps on a limited basis. Half the school one day, the other half the next, for example.  One of the reasons to look at opening schools relatively early in the process of ending of the lockdown is that if we keep schools closed but relax social distancing, we may see an increase in social contacts between children – or between children and vulnerable grandparents. We are faced with a situation in which nearly nine out of 10 children globally are not in school without fully knowing how this will impact their lives and save other lives. Whatever steps are taken next, we cannot ignore the profound and long-lasting effect this will have on our children’s health, their later development and future opportunities.Russell Viner is professor in adolescent health at UCL and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child HealthWhat happens to coronavirus patients in intensive care - and why is Boris Johnson there?Coronavirus latest news: Donald Trump says WHO got pandemic \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 and insists US has been treated unfairlyWho is Boris Johnson’s deputy with the Prime Minister in intensive care?Boris Johnson in intensive care for coronavirus – everything we know on Wednesday afternoonNo end to lockdown in sight as UK coronavirus deaths rise by 938 in a day\u0026#39Portable priest\u0026#39 leads mobile services as churches close despite lockdownMurder victim\u0026#39s family plead for help to catch killer on the 25th anniversary of her brutal deathArchbishop of Canterbury says Jesus is \u0026#39quite up to date\u0026#39 with technology and urges churches to stay closedLord Darroch says Donald Trump is \u0026#39one of most lethal politicians in modern era\u0026#39Madrid region may have many more coronavirus deaths than Spanish government is reportingHuman encroachment on animal habitats risks more global pandemics, study saysDuke and Duchess of Cambridge join school\u0026#39s Easter \u0026#39show and tell\u0026#39 for lockdown royal visitIntensive care nurses looking after six times more patients because of coronavirusPolice force threatens to fine Easter bank holiday visitors to beauty spotsCoronavirus lockdown could be in place until MayDomestic abuse victims can breach lockdown rules, says police chiefComment: Only one question matters to the Cabinet now: what would Boris do?Scotland’s chief medical officer quits after flouting lockdown advice -  readers have their sayExclusive: Three nurses forced to wear bin bags because of PPE shortage test positive for coronavirusWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/14/15/2020-03-13t142012z-2112659646-rc22jf9eorfy-rtrmadp-3-global-oil-hedges.jpg","title":"coronavirus oil gas industry climate change renewable energy","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Wall Street analysts say the Covid-19 pandemic will permanently alter the energy industry and shift the debate around climate change. Ben Chapman finds out whyOn the open plains of Wyoming, in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, something strange has been happening. Last month, coronavirus itself had barely touched this sparsely populated American state. But the impact of Covid-19 could already be seen.As thousands of aircraft were grounded and billions of citizens ordered to stay home, global demand for oil, the key lubricant of world commerce, had crashed so far and so fast that producers in Wyoming were willing to pay someone 19 cents a barrel to take it off their hands. It was worse than worthless, it had become a burden.A thousand miles northwest, in Alberta, Canada, home to perhaps the world’s single largest deposit of hydrocarbons, a similar story was playing out.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast week, if you so desired, you could have purchased one of Canada’s estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil, for just $5. In other words, 158 litres of the world’s most vital commodity\u0026nbsp would set you back less than a pint of beer.Black Monday: Why cheap oil sent world’s stock markets into a tailspinThis is not mere trivia from obscure corners of the global oil market. It could have lasting impacts on what will soon return to being the most important battle facing humanity – the climate crisis.US and Canadian oil production looks set to be decimated by the catastrophic slump in oil demand and some experts think it will have a hard time bouncing back. Thousands of jobs will go and many oil wells will cease production. This in turn, the argument goes, will aid the shift towards a lower carbon world.There are other aspects to the crisis\u0026nbspthat could be good for the climate potential changes in our behaviour could stick with us, meaning people work from home more often, travel less and shop locally, for example. Companies that currently fly supplies from all around the world or rely on migrant labour may conclude that building things closer to home is less risky.While these may sound like the rosy predictions of green campaigners seeking a silver lining, they are in fact those of Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street investment bank is not known for environmental utopianism, its analysis is hewn from mountains of data and cold, hard facts.Currie and his team believe that plummeting demand caused by the current crisis could, paradoxically, lead to a massive spike in oil prices next year when the economy comes out of hibernation. They predict that the oil industry won’t be able to keep up, leaving a gap for renewables such as wind and solar to fill.In an eye-catching report, Currie said coronavirus would “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics, restrict demand as economic activity normalises and shift the debate around climate change”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA key reason for this is that the energy source to which the industrialised world has been addicted for more than a century has some major physical constraints. It can’t simply be turned off and on like a tap, Currie tells The Independent.It’s going to require a lot of money to be spent to fix the industry“Oil wells are very different from other industrial processes. They’re organic deposits that require pressure to extract them. When you shut them down you typically do damage to the well,” says Currie.No one has ever attempted to turn off the oil supply so quickly as in the last couple of weeks. Global demand has cratered by as much as 30 per cent, or 30 million barrels a day, far in excess of anything seen in any previous downturn. Meanwhile, Russia and Saudi Arabia have kept production levels high as they engage in a battle for market share.“Because oil, and energy more broadly, must be contained within infrastructure like pipelines tankers and refineries, you can’t run a surplus indefinitely,“ says Currie. “You can’t just pour the oil outside of the well, it has to go into the system.”Key parts of that system are already full, so many producers, particularly those based inland that are reliant on pipelines rather than ships to transport their oil, will have no choice but to shut down, or “shut in”, in industry parlance.Why has the oil price crashed by 30 per cent?Zero-hours contract workers ‘sacked by text’ during Covid-19 outbreakThe world will recover from Covid-19 – it may not from climate changeHedge funds continue to short sell UK companies despite calls to stopHedge fund billionaire vows to punish companies over climate changeShutting in and then opening up again can be prohibitively expensive, which is why producers in Alberta, Wyoming and beyond are willing to sell oil at a loss rather than halt production altogether.Oil is often described as being found in “reservoirs” or “pools”, giving the misleading impression that it sits in cavernous holes underground which simply have to be located and tapped. It’s easy to imagine sticking something akin to a huge straw in the ground and sucking out the oil.In truth oil deposits are often found saturated in tiny holes of porous rocks. Pressure must be applied constantly\u0026nbspto force the oil out of the well. This is easy at the start when pressure can be naturally high, resulting in the kind of gusher often depicted by Hollywood.But, as a well matures, it becomes increasingly tricky – and therefore expensive – to apply the required pressure and extract oil. Starting up the process again, or drilling new wells, adds further cost.The wells most vulnerable to being shut down and never opening up again are those in North America and Russia, says Currie: “It’s going to require a lot of money to be spent to fix the industry.”That money is no longer forthcoming in the quantities that many oil companies have grown used to, meaning only the largest and most efficient companies are likely to survive.If the world is addicted to oil, the oil industry itself is addicted to cash, requiring huge injections of capital to fund exploration and production. But appetite for investing in fossil fuels, particularly in uncertain times, is drying up. With tens of billions of dollars likely to be wiped out as the majority of small, heavily indebted, US oil producers go to the wall, that appetite is likely to reduce even further.Capital markets are more cagey about handing money to oil producers after years of below-par returns. Meanwhile, banks are beginning to cut back financing for oil and gas, and large funds, including Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, have reduced their investment in the sector. The Bank of England is also looking into climate stress testing that could force lenders to get rid of assets at risk as the world shifts to net zero carbon.At the same time, renewables are rapidly becoming a more attractive investment. A wind farm requires a lot less capital than an oil field, and while the returns are less spectacular they are more solid and reliable.Paul Flood, portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, says companies that produce renewable energy are unique in that they remain stable even through turbulent economic times. That makes them an ideal place for governments to focus what will likely be huge stimulus programmes in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. “It fits very nicely. You’re killing two birds with one stone by providing new sources of renewable energy to decarbonise power, and also providing pension funds with stable revenues.“I think if governments are going to do fiscal spending they’re going to have more credibility directing it towards renewables and climate change initiatives than towards oil and gas.”Despite this apparently gloomy outlook for fossil fuels, not everyone is convinced Covid-19 will be a good thing for the climate. Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management\u0026nbspinvests more than £1 trillion of other people’s money, mostly for the very long term.Nick Stansbury, LGIM’s head of commodity research, believes the current slump in oil prices must be seen on balance as bad for the environment. “From a climate perspective, this is really disappointing,“ he says, “it’s not what we wanted to happen. We did not want oil prices to crash, just as we were beginning to see real momentum behind clean technology and its competitiveness. This has set that back in a very disappointing way.”As consumers, we react pretty quickly to cheaper oil. LGIM’s research shows that after the last significant oil price fall back in 2014-15, Americans started buying less efficient cars within a month. Those decisions have implications for emissions for many years until people trade in their SUVs again.However, Stansbury says American drivers have already gone pretty much “all-in” on gas guzzlers, so the current low prices may not cause them to trade up and get even more inefficient vehicles.There is a broader and more important point to all this: if oil stays around $30 a barrel – the current cost of Brent Crude – that clearly underestimates the actual environmental cost of combusting fossil fuels, says Stansbury. He doesn’t see the kind of drastic shortfall in oil supplies that Jeff Currie at Goldman is predicting.“There is a higher probability of oil shortages in the next decade as a consequence of this but I think it’s far from certain that that’s what we will get.” US onshore producers already know about huge reserves of oil, it’s just a case of having access to capital so they can go and drill it.What about those much-heralded changes to our behaviour after the pandemic? Martijn Rats, oil strategist at giant US bank\u0026nbspMorgan Stanley, also foresees a long-term shift away from fossil fuels.He highlights three driving forces of this change. First, the current low oil price gives governments a chance to unwind $300bn of subsidies handed out to the fossil fuel industry each year. Second, economic stimulus programmes required to resuscitate activity after the crisis will likely be used to boost investment in clean energy. And, third, we may work from home more and take less flights.“This does not bode well for oil demand in the long term, especially relative to previous long-term expectations,” Rats wrote in a recent note to clients.A report this week by the AA predicts Covid-19 will cause a permanent reduction in travel in the UK because we’ve quickly adapted to use remote working technology and realised it’s quite effective. The AA even said that a planned £27bn investment in Britain’s roads might not be needed, and perhaps some of the money might be better aimed at improving our broadband internet speeds.Reports of the death of commuting may be greatly exaggerated however, at least for the time being. Nick Stansbury at LGIM thinks it’s too early to tell whether there will be a behavioural shift significant enough to have a real impact on emissions.“Will a lot of us end up working from home a bit more often, gaining a few more hours in our days? We probably will.”But that’s about as much as we can say. Any emissions prevented by fewer journeys to work are likely to be swamped by surging demand for air travel in emerging markets, he says.Jeff Currie at Goldman Sachs believes that higher oil prices after the crisis will hold back demand for flights and make people commute less often.However, given that the world has experienced only a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown conditions, he is sceptical about predictions that the experience will drive long-term changes to our behaviour.“Wait and see,” he says. “We have no idea.”Oil and Gas\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

According to the survey, 7 per of respondents are receiving grants but 14 per cent had applied for one but been unsuccessful.Most of these, 83 per cent, said they had not met the criteria, while 14 per cent said the response from authorities was too slow, or did not come at all.Our latest data shows that many businesses face a cliff-edge scenario, either at the end of this month or over the course of the next quarter, said BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall.We\u0027ve seen a big jump in the number of firms furloughing staff, and many are now starting to apply for access to Government loan and grant schemes to keep themselves afloat. Yet our research suggests that support is only starting to reach firms on the ground.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is intended to make the cost of an overdraft easier to understand and to compare with other forms of borrowing.In response, many banks raised their overdraft rates to about 40 per cent in order to recoup some of the money they will lose from daily charges. Some banks have now reversed those changes, temporarily reverting to the older fees while introducing interest-free limits.HSBC UK will bring in a three-month £500 interest-free buffer from 9 April for bank account and advance account customers.

According to the survey, 7 per of respondents are receiving grants but 14 per cent had applied for one but been unsuccessful.Most of these, 83 per cent, said they had not met the criteria, while 14 per cent said the response from authorities was too slow, or did not come at all.Our latest data shows that many businesses face a cliff-edge scenario, either at the end of this month or over the course of the next quarter, said BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall.We\u0027ve seen a big jump in the number of firms furloughing staff, and many are now starting to apply for access to Government loan and grant schemes to keep themselves afloat. Yet our research suggests that support is only starting to reach firms on the ground.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Borrowers would not have to make repayments on their loans but would still accrue interest.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSantander and HSBC have already announced they will temporarily waive overdraft fees on balances up to £500.

This is intended to make the cost of an overdraft easier to understand and to compare with other forms of borrowing.In response, many banks raised their overdraft rates to about 40 per cent in order to recoup some of the money they will lose from daily charges. Some banks have now reversed those changes, temporarily reverting to the older fees while introducing interest-free limits.HSBC UK will bring in a three-month £500 interest-free buffer from 9 April for bank account and advance account customers.

You go after Trump \u0026amp Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims, you are a lie. You have always been a lie. The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade, so are you. SHAME.”In response, Milano wrote: “I continue to support you and applaud your bravery as well as acknowledge all the people you have helped along the way, @Rosemcgowan. Be well and stay safe.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAlexandra Tara Reade, a former Biden staffer, accused the presidential hopeful of sexually assaulting her when she worked in his Senate office in 1993.The Biden campaign has denied the allegation, writing in a statement: “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.”What Jake Gyllenhaal’s Bubble Boy can teach us about self-isolationMilano has been criticised for still endorsing Biden despite the allegation. Milano has previously supported women who have come forward with sexual assault allegations about Republicans Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.While appearing on Andy Cohen’s US radio show, Milano defended her continued endorsement of Biden, explaining: “I believe that even though we should believe women, and that is an important thing, and what that statement really means is that for so long the go-to has been to not to believe them.”She continued: “So, really we have to societally change that mindset to believing women, but that does not mean at the expense of not giving men their due process and investigating situations. It’s got to be fair in both directions.”“I just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation and I’m sure that the mainstream media would be jumping all over this... if they found more evidence through their investigation. So I’m just sort of staying quiet about it,” Milano explained.McGowan, who portrayed one of three magical sisters alongside Milano on the fantasy series Charmed, said in 2018 that she did not endorse Milano or her political activism.“I don’t like her,” told ABC News. “’Cause I think she’s a lie.

It occurs when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth in its monthly orbit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 7-8 April, the moon will get as close as 356,907km (221,772\u0026nbspmiles) to Earth, making it appear bigger and brighter in the night\u0027s sky.The time of year means this full moon is known in folklore as the \u0027Pink moon\u0027, as it usually coincides with spring flower blossoms.How to take the perfect picture of the supermoon this weekThe best time and date to see the supermoon\u0026nbspis at moonrise on Tuesday and at moonset on Wednesday, when it is close to the horizon.This is due to an optical illusion that makes it appear even bigger due to its relative size to buildings and objects on the horizon.\u0026nbspThe supermoon\u0027s peak illumination will take place just after\u0026nbsp6pm\u0026nbspGMT on Tuesday, though it may not be visible until after sunset.The term was first coined by astrologer Richard Nolle\u0026nbspin 1979, who defined a supermoon\u0026nbspas any full moon that was within 90 per cent of its closest approach.Created with Sketch.Pink supermoon lights up the night sky: In pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The coinage and use of the term has been criticised by astronomers, however some welcome it as a way to encourage interest\u0026nbspin astronomy.“Some astronomers complain about the name supermoon. They like to call supermoons hype,” astronomer and EarthSky contributor Bruce McClure wrote recently.“But supermoons aren’t hype. They’re special. Many people now know and use the word supermoon. We notice even some diehards are starting to use it now... No doubt about it. Supermoon is a catchier term than perigean\u0026nbspfull moon.The supermoon will also have an effect on the Earth’s ocean, Mr McClure notes, with the extra gravitational pull from the moon creating extra-high\u0026nbsptides.People living along the coast will notice them one or two days after the supermoon has passed, though any risk of flooding is unlikely unless the high tides are combined with severe weather.For most parts of the UK, Wednesday will see exceptionally good weather with highs of up to 24C\u0026nbspin the south and east.Clear skies and reduced air pollution due to the coronavirus lockdown means April’s supermoon could be one of the best ever times to view a supermoon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we’re committed to working with others groups and organisations who come might along to help meet the needs of the community in different ways as time goes on.”He said the group has a pool of over 250 volunteers and an on call rota who are now getting several dozen calls a day from people in the area in “real need” of supplies.“Whatever help\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspcan give in mapping the support network across the country is a good thing, especially if it means more people get access to the support they need,” Mr Vine added.Many food aid charities have been struggling with a drop in donations and a fall in the number of regular volunteers.

There are a lot of people are struggling to make rent, struggling with loss of income, struggling to access universal credit, as well as isolating for health reasons.

Yet members of the public still able to help are signing up to serve a worthy cause.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMarina Nenadic, 30, is one of a several new recruits at\u0026nbspCity Harvest\u0026nbspin Acton, west London, after the food surplus charity called for more hands to sort through the produce rescued from restaurants, manufacturers and supermarket packing houses.“I’m working from home four days a week, so I had some extra time, and I really wanted to do something useful with it,” she explained. “It’s within walking distance of where I live, so I’m not taking any extra risks with journeys.”How to support our campaignMs\u0026nbspNenadic\u0026nbspis a marketing executive for\u0026nbspKew\u0026nbspGardens, but she now spends at least one day a week creating crates of food packages for the 300 smaller groups – including\u0026nbspfood banks, low-income family projects and homeless shelters – served by City Harvest.“It’s a really positive atmosphere, despite the fact it’s such difficult times. It’s actually quite exciting to see so much food come in, knowing it’s going out to people who need it. It’s been such a rewarding thing to do.”In the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, City Harvest has rescued and redistributed over 130 tons of surplus food. Responding to the enormous scale of the crisis, the group has joined forces with even larger food surplus charities in the capital – our campaign partner The Felix Project and Fareshare – to create the\u0026nbspLondon Food Alliance.In a bid to make sure\u0026nbspfood gets out to those who need it\u0026nbspas efficiently as possible, the London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies.Liz Taylor, 61, signed up for volunteering work at The Felix Project last week, and is now packing and delivering food at\u0026nbspthe charity’s main Park\u0026nbspRoyale\u0026nbspwarehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s actually a bit of relief to get outside and do something. It’s obviously worthwhile, but it’s good for my wellbeing too.”Mohamed Elmi, 34, volunteering with City Harvest for the past 18 months, says\u0026nbspsome of the Acton-based charity’s few dozen or so new volunteers have recently lost jobs in the hospitality industry.“It’s been a difficult time for them but this gives them a sense of purpose,”\u0026nbspsays Mr Elmi, who also works full-time for a homeless healthcare charity. “It’s really helped us fill in for some of the volunteers who are having to stay at home. Yes, we’re putting ourselves at risk – but this work is really needed right now.”London mayor Sadiq Khan told The Independent: “The altruism of the British people in recent days has been a beacon of hope amid the darkness of the coronavirus.”He added: “You can donate spare food at a series of hubs being set up across the city.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And use food delivery services where you can.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTesco said it had increased the capacity of its grocery home-shopping service by 20 per cent – an additional 145,000 slots – during the coronavirus outbreak but “there is simply not enough capacity to supply the whole market”.The retailer added it was trying to prioritise deliveries to the most vulnerable people.It has also implemented safety measures in its stores, including social distancing rules and one-way aisles.\u0026nbspWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe boss of rival supermarket company Iceland has previously urged healthy shoppers to ignore the prime minister’s advice and buy food in stores to free up delivery “for those who need it most”.Sainsbury’s is reserving all of its delivery slots for shoppers who are elderly or have existing health problems, while Asda has written to vulnerable customers to offer them priority access to online shopping.Many retailers have implemented limits on purchases in response to widespread panic-buying which saw supermarket shelves emptied and delivery slots booked up for weeks.Tesco acknowledged that “significant panic buying cleared the supply chain of certain items” in the first few weeks of the crisis, with sales soaring 30 per cent. But it added: “This has now stabilised across the group and more normal sales volumes are being experienced.”The supermarket chain said it had seen “significant absence” of staff as Covid-19 spreads around the UK and had recruited 45,000 additional employees in the last fortnight.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers are almost certain that at least at its beginning, the universe was expanding uniformly.But that assumption might\u0026nbspbe wrong, at least in the universe of today, according to a new study using data from Nasa and European Space Agency observatories. Researchers using that information found that the different parts of the universe are actually expanding at different rates, with clusters of galaxies in different parts of the sky behaving differently.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOur usual understanding of the universe suggests that after the Big Bang, the universe began to expand in all directions, with galaxies and galaxy clusters moving apart at the same rate across the cosmos. The new study suggests that might not be the case, with that rate actually varying depending on where we look.Based on our cluster observations we may have found differences in how fast the universe is expanding depending on which way we looked, said co-author Gerrit Schellenberger\u0026nbspfrom the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. This would contradict one of the most basic underlying assumptions we use in cosmology today.Scientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingResearchers have long attempted to find a definitive answer to whether the universe is in fact the same in all directions. They have attempted to measure it using a variety of different methods, including looking at galaxies through infrared and watching exploded stars, but nothing has proven decisive and the results have given indications both ways.To find their measurements in the new study, researchers used a new technique to try and measure the expansion of the universe. They looked at more than 800 galaxy clusters using the new technique, in an attempt to understand at precisely what rate it they are expanding at.Firstly, they worked out the amount of X-rays a given galaxy cluster would be emitting, in a way that gives a constant answer independent of changes such as the expansion speed of universe. Taht relied on the relationship between the temperature of the hot gas in a galaxy cluster and the amount of X-rays, or its X-ray luminosity.Secondly, they worked out X-ray luminosity using a different method that did in fact rely on the universe\u0027s expansion speed. Those numbers showed that the expansion speed was not actually uniform, and that the universe is moving away from us at different speeds in different parts.It is not the first time that researchers have found evidence of the uneven expansion of the universe, but may be the one that shows it more convincingly than any other.This is a hugely fascinating result, said Norbert Schartel, a project scientist on ESA\u0027s XMM-Newton observatory, which helped contribute towards the discovery. Previous studies have suggested that the present Universe might not be expanding evenly in all directions, but this result – the first time such a test has been performed with galaxy clusters in X-rays –\u0026nbsphas a much greater significance, and also reveals a great potential for future investigations.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But this may be unlikely given that scientists expect the universe\u0027s expansion to be the main deciding factor of that speed.If that is not the case, the research suggests that the universe is not actually isotropic, and that it is different in different directions.\u0026nbspDark energy, for instance, could be distributed differently throughout the universe and could be causing unusual results.Researchers have described the expansion of the universe being like a loaf of raisin bread that has been placed in the oven: as it cooks, it expands, and the raisins that represents the galaxies move away from each other. If the bread is evenly mixed, the expansion would be uniform, but the latest results suggest that there may be an overlooked ingredient in the dough.This would be like if the yeast in the bread isn\u0027t evenly mixed, causing it to expand faster in some places than in others, said co-author Thomas Reiprich, also of the University of Bonn. It would be remarkable if dark energy were found to have different strengths in different parts of the universe. However, much more evidence would be needed to rule out other explanations and make a convincing case.The study is published in the latest issue of the journal\u0026nbspAstronomy and Astrophysics and can be read online.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You\u0027re needed\u0027Joe Biden has commended Bernie Sanders for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just America following the Vermont senator\u0027s withdrawal from the 2020 race.After facing endless criticism from the senator\u0027s supporters throughout the campaign, the former vice president is now calling on the senator\u0027s millions of backers for their endorsement as he looks likely to lock in the Democratic party\u0027s nomination to face Donald Trump in November.In a statement, the candidate said: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You\u0027re needed. ... Together we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we\u0027ll not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation —\u0026nbspwe\u0027ll transform it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis statement borrowed language from progressives that have pointed to the coronavirus crisis as the kind of institutional failure addressed by Mr Sanders\u0027 campaign.Mr Biden said said that the pandemic has laid bare the biggest cracks in the social safety net\u0026nbsp... from\u0026nbsphealth care to paid sick leave to a more extensive and comprehensive system of unemployment benefits, issues that were the hallmarks of the Sanders campaign.Bernie Sanders ends his campaign for presidentBernie\u0027s run is over — but we might yet see him in the White HouseAOC thanks Bernie Sanders after he suspends 2020 campaignTrump thanks Elizabeth Warren for Bernie Sanders\u0027 exitWill the 2020 US election go ahead as planned?He said his campaign will need to address these ... just as we need to address rebuilding our nation\u0027s infrastructure. And we all know -- the clock is ticking -- we don\u0027t have a moment to waste in combating the climate crisis.Eight months ahead of the general election, the candidate\u0027s call for party unity is likely in the hopes of avoiding similar party clashes in 2016 that sparked a progressive movement following Mr Sanders\u0027 candidacy and forced an examination of the party\u0027s status quo.In his statement, the presumptive nominee praised Mr Sanders, saying it\u0027s voices like Bernie\u0027s that refuse to allow us to just accept what is -- that refuse to accept we can\u0027t change what\u0027s wrong in our nation -- that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn\u0027t our responsibility, too.Created with Sketch.

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

And they take advantage now to say, ‘Yes, I’ve been a victim’.

Why the hell not As Iceland boss Richard Walker says: “We have spoken to the Government about this.“My hands are still tied with these archaic Sunday trading laws.“This is a moment of national crisis and we need our shops open.”When the current three weeks of lockdown ends next week, it will inevitably be extended.This will be a bitter pill for everyone in lockdown Britain.Scrapping the Sunday trading laws would make it easier to swallow.PRINCE William wants toto his air ambulance duties.Meanwhile, Prince Harry scuttles off to Los Angeles in the last private jet out of Canada before the borders closed.And the tragedy is that Harry would have been brilliant during our national emergency.Harry was born for mucking in, raising spirits and doing his bit.Can you imagine the reaction Harry would have got in an overstretched NHS hospital  What a waste.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not.

That isn’t a position we are in yet.He added: We will be reviewing it and we will be led by the scientic evidence when its the right time.We need to start seeing the numbers coming down and thats when youre in the negative.Thats when you have a sense when thats sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that.Both Mr Raab and Professor Whitty stressed that Britain needs to reach the peak first before looking at whether the lockdown measures can be changed or relaxed.Government sources stressed earlier that a formal review of the lockdown may not happen on Monday but would be around that date.Professor Whitty said last night: Its really important we get to the point we are confident we are beyond the peak.There are a large number of dferent things we need to take into account here.Meanwhile the London Mayor said today that the peak is not expected to be this weekend as previously thought.Sadiq Khan told BBCs Radio : We think the peak is probably still a week and a half away.We are still on a daily basis seeing too many people losing their lives.He added that the capital was nowhere near being able to lt restrictions.World Health Organisation Europe director Dr Hans Kluge warned countries not to ease social distancing restrictions.It is, once again, the time to double or triple collective efforts with the support of society.Italy has already extended its own lockdown measures until at least the middle of May.The Italian lockdown was due to end initially on March  but has already been extended twice.Even in China, areas of Wuhan are still only just coming out of lockdown after being kept inside for two months.Last week Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed that the crucial anti-body test that will identy whether an inidual has had the virus will not be included in the new target to reach , tests a day by the end of the month.This is despite the test being central to the Government’s exit strategy for ending the lockdown measures.It all-but confirms the Government will be forced to extend the current lockdown rules when they are up for their three-week review on April .Yesterday a record  deaths were recorded - taking the total dead above ,.But yesterday experts said the data showed there was some cautious optimism of the figures, and the rate of new cases may be slowing.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Government departments have started to work on plans to end the lockdown in the coming weeks, but no decisions have been made.Today one minister suggested that schools could be the first thing to re-open - possibly as soon as after the Easter break.One told the Financial Times: We need to be led by the science, of course. Butwe can reopen schools after the Easter holidays things could begin to get back to normal.It could kick-start the economy,” a senior minister said.No would only say it would be “guided by the science”.Several ministers are said to believe schools should reopen two weeks after the Easter holidays.Yesterday a study by University College London found that school closures had a relatively small impact on the spread of coronavirus.Experts said weeks ago that they were unlikely to shut schools until they needed to as it was not expected to have a major impact.It has also been suggested that the lockdown could have a staggered end - such as allowing dferent sectors of workers or areas in the country out first.But key to ending the shutdown will be mass testing for everyone, Matt Hancock said last week.However, efforts have been severely restricted by the fact that no home kit test to showsomeones had the virus has yet been deemed to be accurate enough.Ministers are calling on the industry to step up and seethey can develop a finger-prick test which can be done at home.None of the tests so far have been shown to work.When one does, ministers want to ship millions of them out so that those who have had the disease can be given immunity certicates or a wristband to show they have had it and are likely to be immune.Last night the PM spent his second night in intensive care after he started to struggle to breathe.The Times reported that his persistent fever - which had not gone away since he fell ill - has finally started to ease.This morning Dominic Raab - who is standing in for him - said he was doing fine.He is said to be still stable and has not yet required a ventilator to help him breathe.The PM has had oxygen, but its not known what other treatment hes had.And he is said to still be in good spirits.Medical experts have predicted that Mr Johnson may need several weeks off work to recuperate from his ordeal once he is able to leave intensive care.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

including how and when to end the lockdown.If Mr Johnson was forced to rest and recover for an extended period time, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would continue to take control of the government after he was asked to stand-in for the PM yesterday.This means he would have extra powers such as chairing National Security meetings, but he would not have weekly meetings with the Queen.He would also have to seek permission from the National Security Council in order to launch  any military action.One father, Matt Dockray,  who was treated in ICU for COVID- said it was a long road of recovery.He told Good Morning Britain: Theres still a long road of recovery, it takes about six to eight weeks, but you can sit here and tell the tale and fight this.Mr Dockray was healthy before being infected.He said: There was a point where you sort of started to lose hope and thought that was it, because youve seen this on the TV, youve seen the pictures of Italy.Mr Raab said last night any decisions made on ending the lockdown would be made collectively by Cabinet, and could not answerhe would overrule ministersthere was signicant disagreement.He said: I’ve been given a clear steer from the PM — very clear instructions in terms of dealing with coronavirus.He’s asked me to deputise for him for as long as is necessary, but the normal cabinet collective responsibility and principles that inform that will apply.Power of Britains nuclear arsenal, which normally rests with the PM, would sit with Mr Raab and the Cabinetneeded.Mr Raab will also be chairing the Cobra meetings where decisions on extending lockdown are expected to be reviewed later this week.Decisions will be informed by experts assessments on the scale of the outbreak.But Mr Raab will ultimately need to make a political call over extending them and restricting iniduals freedom.Even people who have not needed hospitalisation for suspected cases of coronavirus have said they were knocked sideways by the disease for  days or more. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our focus is on stopping transmission while building NHS capacity, as that is what will save lives.Government insiders also distanced themselves from a University College London study earlier this week that claimed the school closures had a tiny impact on the spread of the virus.Researchers claimed closures along could reduce UK deaths during the Covid- outbreak by as little as  per cent, while warning that the costs to children’s health and education were “high”.Currently only the children of key workers are allowed to send their kids in.But a DfE spokesperson said this afternoon: Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the children who are most vulnerable.We will re-open schools when the scientic advice indicates it is safe to do so.No insisted today that there would be a review of the three-week lockdown at some point next week - but they did not say when.The PMs spokesperson said: We said we would set out an announcement in three weeks, there is no change to that.They stressed that the countrys focus needs to be on stopping transmission and building up capacity in the NHS.While this is dficult, they need to stick with it, they said.This lunchtime former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he thought the lockdown would likely be extended for another month.The Government has refused to be drawn on when the lockdown will be extended and how long for.But with the peak still  days away - and with a record number of deaths yesterday - it is likely it will last until the end of the month at least.Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and his deputy, Jenny Harries, have repeatedly said it depends on the success of the lockdown measures so far.Yesterday the UK coronavirus death toll hit a new high after  deaths were recorded - bringing the total past , on the deadliest day so far.Denmarks government has already announced plans to reopen schools for children aged  and under.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A [charter] plane for a few of us would be very expensive, a flight for  of us we could afford.”He said the airline was very helpful and that he then contacted the British Embassy in Phnom Penh to get some support for his plan.Jerry said: “Those last few days were traumatic. I put my head over the parapet. Basically, my we and I did not sleep for a number of days.“We had  people relying on us, as well as their parents and grandparents.“I also had to deal with a load of people who thought I was a fraud and trying to scam people out of their money.”However, he said that embassy officials just buried their heads in their sand and insisted on protocols that did not cover the unique situation they were in.Jerry said: “They needed to tear up the manual and do things dferently.They should have contacted me and got me on their team. I could have sorted out three flights by now and got everyone out of there. Their team is clearly not big enough and they seem overwhelmed.”In spite of the setbacks, the flight left on March .Up to a million Brits have had to rely on government help to get them home, including  who were left trapped in Peru when many South American countries closed all their borders.Now safely back in the UK, the Lewis want to help others still stranded by the COVID- lockdown.The couple are trying to organise a second one to help Brits still stranded in the Southeast Asian country.Since the lockdown the government has advised Brits to avoid travelling abroad indefinitely.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: “We recognise British tourists abroad are finding it dficult toto the UK because of the unprecedented international travel and domestic restrictions that are being introduced around the world – often with very little or no notice.“The government has partnered with a number of airlines who have committed to work together to get Brits back to the UK and up to £ million has been made available for charter flights were commercial options are no longer available. We’ll continue working around the clock to bring people home.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus leader of the opposition ask difficult questions","story":"THESE are pretty grim times. For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, pictured, appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again.

Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls.

That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Number  said there were no plans to change the timeline of reviewing social distancing rules, which Boris Johnson said would be looked at again three weeks into the plan.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We set out that we would make further announcements in three weeks and thereaposs no change to that.” Askedthe public should expect an update next week, he said: “Iaposve always said you shouldnapost necessarily always assume it will be on the specic day, but yes - on or around the three week mark, yes.” Later, at the daily coronavirus briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the weekly COBRA meeting tomorrow involving England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will include a discussion of a review of the lockdown. He said: There will be a COBRA meeting tomorrow chaired by the FSOS involving the devolved administrations to talk about the approach to the review. We committed that there would be a review in around three weeks. That review will be based on the evidence and the data provided by SAGE which will only be available next week.” He added: “I don’t want to start speculating about the future. I think that’s not helpful at this juncture. I think the thing now is for people to focus unequivocally on the advice.”  The law does not say the lockdown can roll on indefinitely - it must be reviewed in some form. It says a Cabinet minister must review the need for restrictions and requirements under the emergency law at least once every  days, with the first review being carried out by th April . Boris Johnson originally said the ban on leaving home without good reason would be reviewed after three weeks - which expire at the end of the Easter weekend. But the government has now made clear it will last for longer - and health minister Edward Argar today admitted I donapost know when it will end. First Secretary of State Dominic Raab said last night it was “too early” to consider an exit plan from the lockdown.

The Chancellor said a review would go ahead but restrictions are likely to be extended. Parents fear kids’ education will suffer. Meanwhile a Tory MP has also demanded schools be reopened as soon as safe. As ministers came under pressure to tell parents whether their children canto the classroom, Robert Halfon said he was worried some kids will be left behind because of the ongoing coronavirus lockdown. Health chiefs insist it is “premature” to say when the restrictions will be lted and they are likely to extend beyond next week. And Mr Sunak announced the review of the ­lockdown will go ahead on Sunday, more than three weeks after it was imposed, but refused to put a time on when an exit strategy will start. It is all but certain that schools will not be opening after the Easter break. But heads and MPs have said that, while it would be unsafe toin coming weeks, they would hope to be able to open fully before the end of the summer term in July. As the number of UK deaths rose by  to ,, Mr Halfon – chair of the Education Select Committee – said: “Obviously I want schools to open as soon as possible because I’m really worried about what’s going to happen to left-behind kids. If they’re stuck at home they’re potentially going to suffer enormously. “Education is the most important thing we can give to children and young people and it’s vital that schools open as soon as the science allows. It has to be a number one priority for the Government.” Mr Halfon spoke after review from University College London last week cast doubt on the effectiveness of school closures in halting the disease.  A former World Health ­Organisation executive yesterday revealed his four-step strategy to ease Britain out of lockdown. Professor Karol Sikora said the first step would be to let small businesses open again on April , with all schools following from May . But unions have stressed the safety of teachers, pupils and the community – must come first. Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the NASUWT, said: “Everyone is anxious toto normality as soon as possible, but decisions to either strengthen or loosen the current restrictions must always be governed by the medical and scientic evidence Political or business considerations must never be allowed to override the safety of pupils, school staff and the wider community.” And Whitehall sources insisted no date had been set to reopen schools in England, and that a date would only emerge once scientic advice concluded it was safe for them to do so.  Mr Sunak said: “We committed there would be a review in and around three weeks, that review will be based on the evidence and data, which will only be ­available next week. I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus ­seriously on the here and now. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is standing in for Boris Johnson as the PM is treated from Covid-, will chair a COBRA meeting with the devolved administrations to discuss the response to the lockdown. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said evidence from other ­countries suggests the peak remains “for some time” before a reduction occurs. He added: “I think it’s ­reasonable to say that the ­lockdown is going to need to continue for a while and we don’t need to take this decision at the beginning of next week.”  The Welsh government has already decided to extend the restrictions by at least another week. First Minister Mark Drakeford told a virtual meeting of the Welsh Assembly: “We will not throw away the gains we have made, and the lives we can save, by abandoning our efforts just as they begin to bear fruit.” He revealed he had discussed the matter with ministers across the rest of the UK – which is widely expected to follow suit. London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned on Wednesday the UK was “nowhere near” coming out of the ­lockdown and the peak of the illness was still a week-and-a-half away. He said the capital was still seeing “too many people losing their lives” and must brace for restrictions to last much longer.  Health minister Edward Argar admitted “I don’t know” when the ­lockdown would end, with the key factor being when new cases each day “peak” and start to fall. The authorities face more immediate concerns over the four-day Easter weekend, with the expected warm weather prompting fears that parks and beaches will again be packed. Experts say any easing of social distancing measures relies on widespread testing - which Britain has fallen woefully behind on. Ministers are reportedly preparing to issue a plea to UK industry to build a home antibody test that would help exit the lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised , daily tests by the end of the month so that all stretched NHS staff who are self-isolating can be checked for the virus.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe coronavirus outbreak has led to us being bombarded with health information, which can mean it becomes harder and harder to know the facts. The quantity of the advice spread across social media, much unveried, means rumour and myth can quickly be shared Dr Gero Baiarda, an NHS GP currently on call at GPDQ - a GP-on-demand service - has outlined what he believes are  myths that need tackling. . Coronavirus is a living organism The virus, officially named Sars-CoV-, is technically not alive, Dr Baiarda said. The virus is a protein super molecule rather than a living organism. Dr Baiarda said that as a result you cannot kill the virus, but that does not mean it cannot be destroyed or allowed to decay. The time it takes to break down depends on the environmental temperature, humidity and type of material upon which it settles, he said. . People are most contagious before they even know they have the virus This is untrue, Dr Baiarda says. He said the virus invades, infects and destroys cells, allowing millions of new viruses to be created that can be passed on to others or shed on surfaces. Spread is most effective, therefore, in coughed droplets, he said. Patients who are asymptomatic can, however, pass on the virus as soon as they are infected. . Sars-CoV- is a hardy virus Dr Baiarda, says the virus is in fact surprisingly fragile, with its only protection being a thin outer layer of lipid or fat. That is why any soap or detergent, both of which break down fat, will destroy it - even washing up liquid works well, he added. It is also why it is so important that we all keep washing our hands regularly with soap and water. . If delivery drivers wear gloves, they will not spread it This is wrong. Every item that a gloved hand touches can then be contaminated, Dr Baiarda said. A recent study from the New England Journal of Medicine found the virus can survive for several hours on cardboard, he added. To stay safe, the best advice is not to touch the parcel until ideally the following day, he said. . The virus cannot be passed on by food This appears to be an area up for some debate, as Dr Baiarda adopts a stricter approach to the risks posed by food than other experts. Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency say you are very unlikely to catch the virus through food or via food packaging. Dr Baiarda said transmission through food is less likely than other means, but argues it is definitely still possible. If someone who has the virus on their hands touches food, it is very likely to become contaminated for many hours, he said. To denature and inactivate the virus, food should either be washed or cooked at °c at least for four minutes or more.  . Sanitiser with % alcohol is as effective as washing your hands in soap and water Wrong. Squirting a little bit of alcohol gel on your palms and rubbing them together is not effective, Dr Baiarda said. You need to cover the entire surface of both hands including fingers and thumbs, but this should be done only after the hands are free of any residues - such as after sneezing. The small bottles of sanitiser are part of the problem, as people assume a small amount is ample. . Drinking alcohol will prevent people from getting the virus Sadly for those who enjoy a little tipple, this is not true. The only alcohol helping to stop the spread of the virus is that found in hand sanitiser. Dr Baiarda said: This is only for external use, and even then, it is only effectiveit has a concentration of % or above,you use enough, and in the right way. . Moisturising hands after washing reduces cleanliness Dr Baiarda said: Incorrect. Moisturising the skin is very important. The virus can lodge itself in damaged skin on your hands cracked by repeated washing, so itaposs important to try to avoid this. Keeping fingernails short will reduce the risk of sheltering and passing on the virus too.  . Washing hands is not as important when self-isolating, as you are all virus-free Dr Bairada said this perspective is simply wrong. If you are bringing in shopping, deliveries and post into your home, then washing your hands remains important. Every time you wash your hands you will break the chain of infection. If in doubt, give them a wash, he added. This means for at least  seconds, with warm, soapy water and then ideally using disposable paper towels rather than a communal one. If using towels, try to stick to one per person and wash them daily, Dr Baiarda added.

But Prof Hill said many Covid- patients eventually #xCprogress to invasive ventilation#xD. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves. A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient#xs own breathing. The patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tubeis guided through the mouth into the windpipe. Heavy sedation is then continued because having a tube in the throat can be very uncomfortable.

Sophie Clayton, , had to do a real le apos First Datesapos and fall in love again after had a nosebleed in November  which caused her brain to disconnect from her nervous system. Within minutes she forgot her phone pin code, the date - and then her own name and was rushed to hospital. And while she was soon on the road to recovery she had no recollection of her boyfriend, Jonathan Wilson, . So just like the movie starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, he set about dating her for the aposfirst timeapos again. Besotted Jonathan made her photo albums of the key moments in their relationship, and took her back to the location of special dates. He took her to the spot in Kew Gardens where he first askedsheaposd be his girlfriend and filled in the huge gaps in her memory with cherished moments he remembered. Sophie from Surrey is slowly getting her le back on track and said sheaposs falling in love with Jonathan all over again. Emergency resource dispatcher Sophie said: My friends have said that our relationship is just like  First Dates and I can definitely see the resemblance, When everything happened, I felt shocked, confused and sad knowing I had forgotten everything and especially not knowing why. My condition is quite rare so they are still doing research into it and itaposs really frustrating that they canapost tell me why this happened or what caused it. I feel so upset that I’ve lost  years of memories that made me the person I am but I’m looking forward to recreating new ones with everyone I love. Iaposm falling back in love with Jonathan all over again which is so lovely. Although I am sad that I have forgotten all these things that Iaposve done before, it is quite special getting to see things for the first time with Jonathan. Just the other day, he took me to see the beach for the aposfirstapos time - it was amazing. Doctors canapost saymy memory will ever come back, so for now itaposs like my le started three months ago, but Iaposm just focusing on making new memories rather than pining for the old ones. Before her nose bleed, Sophie was healthy, enjoyed running regularly and worked in the control room for the London Ambulance Service.  She lived with her parents in Surrey and was getting ready for a night sht on November   when she suddenly had a nosebleed. Sophie said: I donapost normally have nosebleeds, but I didnapost think it was really anything to worry about. My nose had been bleeding for about  to  minutes and I was waiting in the kitchen with my mum for it to stop when blood suddenly started pouring out of my left eye. Mum sat me down on the kitchen floor and my left side went completely weak. She phoned for an ambulance as she thought Iaposd had a stroke and I asked her for my phone so I could ring work and let them know I wouldnapost be coming in. Mum gave me my phone and I went to type my PIN in to unlock the screen and I just couldnapost remember the numbers - my mind had gone blank. Sophie was rushed to St Georgeaposs Hospital in London where she was taken for a CT scan and blood tests after the paramedics suspected sheaposd had a stroke. Medics soon discovered she had al neurological disorder- a condition where signals between the brain and nervous system are interupted. FND is most commonly caused by stress or depression, but as Sophie had not been suffering with either, it is likely that she was born with the disorder.  The separation between her brain and nervous system could have happened at any time. In Sophieaposs case, there had been a small amount of pressure on her brain and when the nosebleed released that pressure, it triggered her condition. Sophie said: It was like my brain had been wiped clean, I couldnapost remember anything, I had no idea who anybody was, and I didnapost even know my name or how old I was. A man came into the hospital to see me and I said aposI donapost know who he isapos - it turned out to be my dad. As mum had been with me all the time, I knew that I must know her but I didnapost recognise that she was my mum. Jonathan was the last person I had texted, so I think I knew I had a boyfriend but not who he was exactly - I just kept asking my mumsheaposd told aposthat manapos what had happened. When he arrived at the ward and my mum introduced us, I instantly started crying because I was so desperate to remember him but I couldnapost. Jonathan told me that he loved me and I said that I loved him too, and then he held my hand whilst my dad explained everything the doctors had said so far. The past  years of my le had just disappeared from my memory. I was in a room full of strangers including myself and it was absolutely terrying.

The suspect posted the clip onto YouTube herself today under the caption Arrested for being sat on a park bench! On my own. She had allegedly spent an hour sat on the bench in Richmond, southwest London, on Sunday night to watch the sunset but officers repeatedly asked her to move. When she allegedly refused to do so, the woman was detained and driven away in a police van. In the video, a police officer says he had previously warned the woman she could not sit there for hours on end. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror  He said: Iaposd asked you why you were out and you said you were exercising mentally, to which the woman responds I am, yeah. The officer went on: I donapost think thataposs in the spirit of whataposs happening, The woman then says: Iaposm in the spirit of social distancing. Iaposm sat here on my own. Iaposm not infecting anyone. Thataposs the actual spirit. Quite frankly Iaposm not afraid to be honest. If I catch something I catch it. Iaposm only infecting myself. No one is sat near me.

The PC then says: Well youaposve been sat here for about an hour or so... to which the woman interrupts to say: I have yes, exercising mentally.

She then embroils the officer in a drawn out argument about whether government advice allows aposexercising mentallyapos to which the cop says he does not believe it does. Iaposm sorry, but the law doesnapost specy, she says. The PC says his interpretation is that the exercise needs to be physical, to which the woman crows: But thataposs your interpretation, thataposs not what the law says is it  He then asks her to go home and she refuses until the sun sets - for another hour. The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling. To find a counsellor or psychotherapist who can help you visit our Therapist Directory. You are out, in breach of regulations, he says. Iaposm in total compliance, Iaposm out once a day exercising mentally, thataposs what the regulations say, she adds. She then says sheaposs going shopping later and will go after sunset on her way home. And she makes the officer read out the restrictions being enforced during the pandemic, before inquiring whether they are an act of parliament or just a bill. The police officer points out that the woman is also smoking and drinking, which she accepts. I wonapost accept a fixed penalty notice. Place me under arrest and take me to the station, she adds before saying she will not be giving her address.  The officer gives her every opportunity to just go home, continually asking herthere is a lawful reason why she is out. I want to stay here for sunset, she says. Itaposs very low in the sky. I am going to go home after the sunset. Iaposm not going to sit here all night long. She then starts spouting on about English Common Law, saying her behaviour is not prohibited. The clip has had , views on YouTube alone. The woman wrote under her video: I was out exercising in Richmond today, on my own, the LAW doesnapost specy physical exercise, I was exercising mentally meditating by the river, minding my own business, and these lovely police officers thought I was committing a crime!

But the human race is a hardy bunch - and we have overcome a number of hardships in the past. We have enjoyed monumental health success stories thanks to groundbreaking research breakthroughs and drug developments, to awareness campaigns that change millions of lives.They may not always be as attention-grabbing and donapost rack up the same scale of response on Twitter, but aposgood newsapos health stories do exist and are often the result of a lot of hard work going on in the background.Weaposd be here for weekswe listed all of them, but here are four massive aposgood newsapos health stories from recent times, that are worthy of celebrating over and over again... . The HIV AIDS landscape has been radically transformed Since the discovery of HIV and AIDS in the early-s, treatment has progressed to the point where a person living with HIV on effective antiretroviral treatment can now lead a full and active le and live a normal lespan, says Natasha Dhumma, Head of Policy at NAT . Treatment reduces the level of the virus in a personaposs body to aposundetectableapos levels, which means they cannot pass it on. This game-changing finding that undetectable  untransmittablebecame widely known only in , and has since become an indispensable tool to tackle HIV stigma, she adds.  There have also been vast improvements in HIV prevention in recent years, in particular PrEP , a pill thataposs highly effective at preventing HIV taking hold in the body. In March , the Government committed to making PrEP freely available to all who need it, and this will signicantly reduce HIV transmissions. Despite these immense advancements, Dhumma notes thereaposs still a long way to go with eradicating HIV stigma and discrimination. She said: Knowledge and understanding of the virus among the general public has not kept up with the advancements in science, and this is something we must all work to recty. . Movember has funded vital prostate cancer research Around the world, . million men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, says Dr Mark Buzza, global director of biomedical research at Movember. Movember is a major funder of prostate cancer biomedical research internationally, and weaposve worked hard to establish a strong alliance of researchers and clinicians to work collaboratively on a range of projects that address critical unmet needs for men living with this disease.  A Movember-funded clinical study has recently provided evidence for the first time that a new imaging technique, PSMA PET CT, is more accurate than conventional imaging at detecting cancer thataposs spread to other parts of the body. This will allow clinicians to be more confident in determining the best course of treatment, which will lead to patients being treated more appropriately and ultimately, lives being saved. Another global initiative is examining how intensive exercise and psychosocial support can increase overall survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer - which means more time, in better health, with those they love. In another clinical study, it was shown that a new class of drug, Olaparib, previously approved for breast, oian and pancreatic cancer, has huge potential for some men. . Awareness and support campaigns have helped smokers quit We have seen incredible progress as a result of the UKaposs combined approach to tackling smoking over the last few decades, says Alison Cook, chair of the Taskforce for Lung Health. After the roll out of stop smoking services  years ago, an estimated one million smokers have quit for good, greatly cutting down their risk of suffering from smoking-related diseases.  All of this has had a great impact on respiratory health in the UK, but as the Taskforce for Lung Health data tracker shows, smoking cessation services need to be maintained and prioritisedthe government intends to meet its aim of becoming smoke free by . Less smoking also means signicantly lower risks of other major diseases too, like certain cancers, heart disease and stroke. . Smear tests have saved thousands of womenaposs lives Since the NHS cervical screening programme was introduced back in , itaposs gone on to save an estimated , lives a year. In fact, Joaposs Cervical Cancer Trust, which is dedicated to eradicating the disease, says around % of cervical cancers are prevented entirely thanks to smear tests, which detect early warning signs of cell changes before cancer develops.  Developments have continued to be made, with the introduction of HPV vaccines for certain age groups , and last year seeing changes to the screening programme with the introduction of HPV testing, which is believed will help prevent deaths even further.

It’s so tough and watching all the elderly patients not seeing their family is so awful.” Emma had been working as a nurse in London but while visiting home the country went into lockdown. The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling.

An audience with Jim Carrey  There’s more chance of Donald Trump buying Lochee United.However, in the s, two of Tinseltown’s favourite sons had Dundonians rolling in the aisles of the city’s crown jewel.The appearances of big screen superstars Bob Hope and Danny Kaye at the Caird Hall would kick-start decades more hilarity at Dundee’s premier venue.From wholesome, family entertainment to the crude and the crass, comedy styles may have changed over the years but the laughter has never stopped.In the first of a three-part series, long-serving Caird Hall manager Susan Gillan looks back at some of the finest comedians to step through the hallowed curtain.Scotland’s traditional theatres were, and still are, the stomping ground for funnymen and women on the iety circuit.Dundee’s former Alhambra, the King’s and the Whitehall would be the port of call for legendary performers like Lex McLean and Stanley Baxter.The Caird Hall offered up a dferent type of atmosphere, the traditional stalls and circles were absent.“Bob Hope said at the time it was the first time he had played a tunnel with seats in it,” Susan said.“I think this was because most venues at that time were typical British-style theatres with the circle and stalls so it did look a bit like that.“You have to remember there were no arenas at that time. These were two of the biggest American comedians of their time.”Hope was one of the world’s best-known comedians and had starred in dozens of hugely successful comedy films, including a series of “Road to” films with Bing Crosby.A renowned singer and dancer as well as a comic, Kaye was catapulted to stardom in the film Up in Arms before playing the title character in The Secret Le of Walter Mitty.Both avid golfers, it is believed the pair were keen on a stint in Dundee so they could tee off on the famed courses at Carnoustie and St Andrews.Musicians took centre stage at the Caird throughout the s but comedians such as Jimmy Tarbuck supported many of the acts.The s would see performances from uber-Welsh comic Max Boyce, armed with his trademark leek, and comedian singer Mike Harding.However, in , the inaugural performance of a shaggy-haired, banjo-strumming weegie would set him on the path to becoming one of the Caird Hall’s most popular stars.Susan added: “The s brought us the one and only Billy Connolly in  with the memorable banana boot tour.“Four shows in two days, sold out in a very short space of time and people loved him.“Throughout every visit you can feel the love in the room for this man, it’s amazing.“Billy#s shows were always a great night, even more as time went on and you had parents bringing their -year-old-plus children to see their hero.”The Big Yin would be a keen visitor to the City of Discovery in the years to come with even more sell-outs, culminating in his  swansong.Susan added: “Billy would always take a stroll around the city in the afternoon before his shows.“He loved the ladies in the hats at Fisher  Donaldson in Whitehall Street and he always went to the Gungha Din on Perth Road for a meal at the end of his show. They were great times.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus 755 people test positive for virus across tayside and fife","story":"A total of  people across Tayside and Fe have tested positive for coronavirus.Figures released by the Scottish Government show that there are now  positive cases in Tayside.There are  confirmed cases in Fe.It comes as the Covid- tally for Scotland reached , – a rise of  in the past  hours.Seventy-four more coronavirus deaths recorded in Scotland as confirmed cases rise to ,\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp seventy-four-more-coronavirus-deaths-recorded-in-scotland-as-confirmed-cases-rise-to- embed # secretTfEsKOen\" data-secret\"TfEsKOen\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Earlier today First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that , patients are currently in hospital with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus, with  of them in intensive care.The number of deaths in Scotland due to coronavirus has also risen by  to .The spike in fatalities is due to the new National Records of Scotland system for reporting Covid- fatalities not being “fully operational” in time for last weekend.During the briefing, Ms Sturgeon offered her #deepest# condolences to anyone who has lost friends, family and loved ones as a result of coronavirus.Follow below for the key coronavirus updates:"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee fc james mcpake craig levein dundee united","story":"Dundee manager James McPake has revealed Craig Levein tried to take him to Dundee United.McPake – discussing his playing career on the Evening ’s Twa Teams, One Street podcast – says United were one of three top-flight teams in Scotland who wanted to sign him on a free transfer in  as he prepared to leave Livingston.But he opted for Coventry in the English Championship and has no regrets about the decision.The -year-old said: “I met Craig Levein, who at the time was the manager at Dundee United. I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time. I remember Craig saying that he would be one of the people I’d be coming in to try and play beside.“That was the three teams interested but thankfully I chose Coventry.“I really enjoyed the experience of playing and living in England. I was down there at .“I think I played my best football at Coventry.”The Dark Blues gaffer and Hearts legend Levein would cross paths again years later, this time with international football on the agenda.But for McPake and Scotland, it wasn’t meant to be and he ended up being capped by Northern Ireland and Michael O’Neill.He said: “I was at Coventry and Craig Levein was Scotland manager at the time.“Michael McBride, our physio, worked with me at Livingston and he was the national team physio.“He’d be telling me, ‘They’re down watching you’.“A few times I was really close. I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.“In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis.“This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.”Hello to all of the Dundee fans from all over the globe!  We hope this update finds everyone safe and well during these unprecedented and unimaginable times.  This, I have to say, is the strangest and scariest period, certainly of my letime and it has brought to the forefront, that, despite all of our dferences , we are truly all in this together and as such, we will get through this together.We at Dundee Football Club have been constantly monitoring the situation we find ourselves in due to the COVID- virus and have been taking advice, giving guidance, and implementing protocols to keep our staff, patrons and partners safe and sound as we ensure the sustainability of the club.First of all, the club do indeed have Business Interruption Insurance with specic additions of Notiable Diseases and Prevention of Access to our Commercial Combined Insurance Policy which should allow us to have options to reimburse those losses incurred due to the cancellation of matches. It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over. So from all of us at Dundee Football Club, please stay safe, keep your families safe, that is the most important thing and know that we are all in this together and we will come through this together!"},{"url":null,"title":"george cran coronavirus scottish football dundee united dundee fc","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has hit society with a hammer blow but there is a silver lining to be gleaned from any dark cloud.Le as we knew it has completely changed.My le currently revolves around sitting in my flat coming up with stories to keep football fans entertained during these miserable times, walking my dog and avoiding my we when she tries to get me to do the odd jobs I’ve been putting off for years.I’m sure people reading this will be in a similar boat – day after day, it’s tough to keep going with good cheer.What the situation has given me is a chance to look back and think about all the good times I’ve had since moving to Dundee six years ago.Don’t worry, I’ll not bore you with all the soppy personal stuff but, on the football pitch, there have been some great moments to be witness to.Scottish football is rich with crazy stories on the field – I’m thinking of Wato Kuate totally losing the rag at Tannadice and a rampaging Sofien Moussa picking up two yellow cards in  minutes after coming on as a sub.As much as they were funny looking back, there are a few big wins I covered for both city clubs that stand out to me.Dark Blues might be surprised at my choice for the best performance I’ve seen in recent years.It was February  at Motherwell.Paul Hartley’s team were struggling after losing Greg Stewart, Kane Hemmings and Gary Harkins and that’s why it stands out so much.This was a team without creativity but, a week after beating Rangers, they smashed ’Well - and I can’t remember a better attacking performance I was witness to from a Dundee side.By half-time, a Zak Jules own goal had been added to by two from Marcus Haber and singles from Craig Wighton and Mark O’Hara.Before that game, Dundee’s top scorers in the XI were Haber and Paul McGowan on four which tells you how astonishing it was to see them rip Mark McGhee’s Motherwell to shreds.They would lose the next seven matches and Hartley his job. Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united out of contract","story":"I have to say I feel for players at Dundee and United right now – especially those out of contract this summer.It’s a horrible situation for a lot of people in their jobs right now with no real knowledge of what is going to happen and footballers are no dferent.It is a job at the end of the day, a good one and one a lot of people would love to have.But, just like everyone , players have families and bills to pay. That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-claudio-caniggia-dundee-fc-scotland embed #

lockdown","story":"A north-east superhero livestream is keeping youngsters entertained during the lockdown.Stuart Smith, , said he was inspired to help children stay happy and active during the coronavirus pandemic.The bricklayer and offshore worker, who is employed with Aberdeen-based oil and gas companies, spends his weekends transforming into a superhero – spreading joy to kids at birthday bashes and parties in the north-east.His Elgin-based business, Hire a Hero, sees him don the outfits of DC and Marvel characters including Thor and Black Panther.While new measures have put his business on hold, it hasn’t stopped Stuart and he continues to put a smile on young faces from a safe distance.Posted by Hero For Hire on Friday,  March Stuart said: “We go live from our Facebook page from pm and I do some shout-outs to the kids.“Its almost like a PE class with the running and dancing around so they are getting one form of exercise and having a laugh.”At pm he picks up a bedtime book to read to the children, dressed as some of their favourite characters.He said: “I also spread a message about washing hands and staying indoors, so they can get a better understanding.“We do anything that the children can join in with – I did the cha cha slide as Black Panther and they loved it.“People watch from London, Spain, Portugal and I think the furthest we’ve had is Australia.“There’s a lot of local children too because we’re based in Elgin.”The Fochabers resident established his company in August after realising he had a knack for keeping kids amused.When his son McCauley, now four, asked for a superhero party for his third birthday, Stuart decided to pull out all the stops.“I was looking at bright yellow wellies at the time and thought they’d make great superhero boots.”With marigold gloves, an old yellow belt, a paper mask and a red spandex suit, Super Dad was born and so was an idea.He said: “The kids loved it, they absolutely loved it.“It didn’t bother them that it was an unknown superhero.”Now, with eight movie-quality costumes, he admits children often believe he is the real deal – including his son.He said: “The feedback is phenomenal.“I must admit that it’s good to read it and get the comments saying the kids love it.“Things like that make us feel like were doing something to help and re making a slight dference to their lives.”To tune into Stuart’s livestream visit facebook HeroforHireScotland "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53348024-240x180.jpg

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to

Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

In passing, Professor Hugh Pennington, who she claims has been excluded due to his pro-Union views, is a bacteriologist. Covid-, being a coronavirus, is a virus, so requiring the skills of a virologist. The clue is in the name.But more than these organisational issues, it is arguable that in Scotland the problem of Covid- is dferent from the problem manested in England. For one thing we have fewer areas with a high population density, which are a substantial opportunity for the virus to be passed on to others.Moreover, while I acknowledge problems and shortcomings law is a carer and our son is understandably worried, the fact remains that the death rate in Scotland of those confirmed to have the virus ndash at the time of writing,  of compared to  of  cases .

We welcome the new guidance issued which to a far greater degree provides this clarity and that there is a review process in place sofurther measures are needed then they can be adopted swtly.#Importantly from Unite’s perspective, the Scottish Government have also stated that in the event where non-essential construction work ceases then those firms should do all that is humanly possible to make sure the jobs and incomes of those workers is protected.”Unite has also welcomed news today that a furlough agreement has been reached for offshore catering workersShauna Wright, Unite regional industrial officer, said: “Unite Scotland is delighted that all COTA companies in the North Sea have decided to implement the government furlough retention scheme, which we have been campaigning for across all the offshore sector.#The agreement will relieve the fear and anxiety for hundreds of our members providing catering and ancillary services offshore as their jobs are safe and it will also reduce the financial hardship which a redundancy situation would bring at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3063615.jpg--.jpg?1586252028000\n","title":"advice for consumers as major retailer appoints administrators","story":" The news that Debenhams have announced plans to enter administration may have left many of their customers in the Ballymena area who have gt vouchers wondering what their rights are.Debenhams, which has a Ballymena outlet, announced that it will file for administration for the second time in a year.John French, Chief Executive of The Consumer Council said: “At the moment Debenhams is still accepting gt vouchers online but this may change.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But while the campaign ends, the struggle for justice continues on. https:t.co MYcktb— Bernie SandersApril , The -year-old senator began his latest White House bid facing questions about whether he could win back the supporters who chose him four years ago as an insurgent alternative to the party establishment’s choice, Hillary Clinton.Despite winning  states in , there were no guarantees he would be a major presidential contender this cycle, especially as the race’s oldest candidate.Mr Sanders, though, used strong polling and solid fundraising — collected almost entirely from small donations made online — to more than quiet early doubters.Mr Sanders amassed the most votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, which opened primary voting, and cruised to an easy victory in Nevada — seemingly leaving him well positioned to sprint to the Democratic nomination while a deeply crowded and ided field of alternatives sunk around him.But a crucial endorsement of Mr Biden by influential South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn, and a subsequent, larger-than-expected victory in South Carolina, propelled the former vice president into Super Tuesday, when he won  of  states.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming dee .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bbecd-d--c-ebffb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Joe Biden preparing for a Democratic presidential primary debate with Bernie Sanders, who has announced he is suspending his campaign AP PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJoe Biden preparing for a Democratic presidential primary debate with Bernie Sanders, who has announced he is suspending his campaign In a matter of days, his top former Democratic rivals lined up and announced their endorsement of Mr Biden.The former vice president’s campaign had appeared on the brink of collapse after New Hampshire but found new le as the rest of the party’s more moderate establishment coalesced around him as an alternative to Mr Sanders.Things only got worse the following week when Mr Sanders lost Michigan, where he had campaigned hard and upset Mrs Clinton in . He was also beaten in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho the same night and the results were so decisive that Mr Sanders headed to Vermont without speaking to the media.The coronavirus outbreak essentially froze the campaign, preventing Mr Sanders from holding the large rallies that had become his trademark and shting the primary calendar. It became increasingly unclear where he could notch a victory that would help him regain ground against Mr Biden.I know Bernie well. Heâs a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And itâs hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I wonât try to. https:t.co ZOkCDWFNm— Joe BidenApril , Though he will not be the nominee, Mr Sanders was a key architect of many of the social policies that dominated the Democratic primary, including a “Medicare for All” universal, government-funded health care plan, tuition-free public college, a  US dollar minimum wage and sweeping efforts to fight climate change under the “Green New Deal”.He relished the fact that his ideas — viewed as radical four years ago — had become part of the political mainstream by the next election cycle, as Democratic politics lurched to the left in the Trump era.Mr Sanders began the  race by arguing that he was the most electable Democrat against Mr Trump.He said his working-class appeal could help Democrats win back key states that Mr Trump won in , including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.But as the race wore on, the senator reverted to his  roots, repeatedly stressing that he backs a “political revolution” from the bottom up under the slogan “Not me. Us.”Mr Sanders made clear that while he is exiting the campaign, he will keep pushing for progressive principles.“Please stay in this fight with me,” he told supporters. “The struggle continues.”PAMost ReadBernie Sanders ends US presidential bidHuge bridge collapses in ItalyRonaldinho leaves prison for luxury hotel arrest in ParaguayActing US navy chief resigns amid coronavirus uproarZoo Miami shows off rare clouded leopard kittens,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association Northern Ireland, said: “We know that everyone is missing seeing and socialising with their families and friends during this time. And particularly at Easter when normally people would be able to visit family, take day trips together or enjoy an Easter Sunday lunch. “However, we must all continue to work together to stop the spread of coronavirus and make sure our health system is able to manage and treat patients who become very unwell. That’s why I am appealing to the public not to visit family unnecessarily or see friends for the next few weeks until we have passed the peak of the outbreak.” googletag.cmd.push Dr Anne Carson, chair of the BMA NI consultants committee, added: “Doctors right across Northern Ireland from the most junior doctor to the most experienced consultant will be working right over Easter to care for patients, not only those with COVID- but with other illnesses as well. “Every day I am hearing about health staff right across Northern Ireland who are working unbelievably hard and giving up time with their own families to make sure our hospitals and GP surgeries are staffed and ready to care for patients. “Please help us to help your families by staying at home. Celebrate with just those in your own household. If you are out for a walk or cycle, observe social distancing. If you or someone in your family show symptoms, isolate for  days. googletag.cmd.push “This situation will not go on for ever, and we all look forward to the day when we can see our families again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

Now that many of us have much more time on our hands, social media tends to pilfer more of our head-space that it really deserves. Staying in touch with the outside world is important and for sport fanatics, we need to keep plugged in. It is all so dferent now. If the fixture calendar had stayed as it was, we couldve been running pages of coverage of Derry footballers heading back to ision two as either league champions or runners-up. googletag.cmd.push Had Rory Gallaghers side not qualied for the league final, the County Derry Post wouldve contained a bumper edition of the resumption of the club leagues – one of the most eagerly awaited weekend of the year. Those of you on Twitter could do worse things than scroll back through Tyrone Tribulationsmock updates of the Tyrone championship. It was hilarious and, as someone put it to me during the week, in the current climate, sports reporters are almost doubling up as the positive part of the media partnership. All sectors of the GAA fraternity were selecting their ious teams. Listing a team comprising from players under assorted conditions. For example, Tomaacutes Brady listed the best Ballymaguigan  players he had ever played with. There will be no family stre, with brother Seanwas listed at number . googletag.cmd.push Niall Conway selected a team of the best players he had ever managed. Conway steered Ballymaguigan to the  intermediate championship. Of Tomas selection, Gary Coleman and Andrew McCartney were both on Conways list. ONE PLAYER PER CLUB It was where that I got sucked into a GAA debate. I found myself tagged in a tweet by Castledawsongoalkeeper Aidan McLaughlin. During his time with the Derry minors, Aidan was the only one that came to close to selector Noel McFeely, in terms of passion for the Oakleaf jersey. We soon realised on the steps of Casement, when the minor team sat to watch the seniors after our game was over. Chris McCann named a Derry team from the players he had actually saw playing. The one rule- and it was a savage one – it was one player per club. A ridiculous idea, but Aidan challenged Mickey Wilson, Paul McIntyre, Conan Doherty and myself to our selections. I immediately checked in. “This will be handy enough,” I thought. I adopted the same strategy as my former wing man from underage coaching days – Gerry Jokin McEldowney. “Well fill in the strongest spine, and see from there,” he would say. Te first Derry man on my list was easy – Anthony Tohill. In my view, he is the most complete player ever to play the game. He won both throw-ins the day Derry demolished Down in the  opener. He could catch with the best, had the scoring prowess other midfielders didnt come close to and had the athleticism to match his skill. My first problem was, getting Tohill, McGilligan and Fergal Doc into the same team. I took a cop-out by slotting Tohill to wing-forward – where he won a league medal in  – to accommodate the other two. One of them was McGilligan, who was one of the fastest players on the Derry  at the time and a man mountain of a man. Jack Sheedy was still nursing some of his war wounds months later. That brings me to the other. Why have Derry being struggling of late  One main reason has been their inability to final a replacement for Doc and Patsy Bradley. I remember watching the  All-Ireland Quarter-final when the Dubs beat Derry. Big Fergal was immense. When the final whistle sounded, he collapsed to the ground yards away from seat in the front of the Cusack stand. You often hear managers tell players to run until you can run no more and theyll scrape you up and carry you off. That was one of those days and Fergal Doherty was that man. The big loser to the one player per club rule was Bellaghys Damian Cassidy. He was majestic. His performance in the Ulster final in  was always stick out in my memory. In attack, the first name on the list was Paddy Bradley. He has been Derrys best forward of all-time. He had that swagger that all the top forwards need. The Glenullin man had a sweet left foot and developed his right to a level that had defenders guessing. But once he turned onto his left, he didnt need to look at the posts, it always sailed over. For me, what set him apart was his first touch. All aspiring players, should take note – the ball always stuck. Defenders didnt get a second snf. Even last year in a rare appearance against Drumsurn, he still had his touch. PURE PASSION In defence, Tony Scullion was the first man on the team-sheet. Like Bradley, it wasnt because he was the only player from his club in consideration, it was just because he was both brilliant and inspirational. That block he made in the  Ulster final was just one aspect of it. He played football with a smile on his face. If anyone has a bigger passion for the Derry jersey, Id love to see it. There was a video on social media recently from Derrys The men who won Maguire footage. Scud recalls Derrys homecoming and Maghera being bleck with people. His eyes were jumping out of his head as spoke. My mind raced back to an interview I did with him last year. When recalling how he marked Declan Bonner, Scullion jumped out of his armchair and danced around the living room, with his arms out. Its a moment I will never forget. The problem with Chris McCanns rule was how limited it was. Henry Downey versus Johnny McGurk. Paul McFlynn and Johnny McBride. Chrissy McKaigue or Patsy Bradley. Who do you pick from McKeever, McGilligan and Geoffrey McGonigle  There was only one runner for the goalkeeper jersey, so Enda Gormley wasnt going to get a look in either. Thats the beauty of picking teams. “You are all entitled to your opinion, but mine is the only one that matters,” the affable John Rafferty told the Slaughtneil players one night after training. Paul McIntyre and Conan Doherty have also made their selection. Mickey Wilson is a Down man, so we will let him away with it. As for Aidan McLaughlin, you called us out. Its your turn to nail your colours to the mast. DERRY TEAM: Damien McCusker,Sean Marty Lockhart, Tony Scullion, Gary Coleman,Paul McFlynn, Henry Downey, Chrissy McKaigue,Fergal Doherty, Brian McGilligan,Anthony Tohill, Damian Barton, Sean Leo McGoldrick, Paddy Bradley, Dermot Heaney, Enda Muldoon.

Now that many of us have much more time on our hands, social media tends to pilfer more of our head-space that it really deserves. Staying in touch with the outside world is important and for sport fanatics, we need to keep plugged in. It is all so dferent now. If the fixture calendar had stayed as it was, we couldve been running pages of coverage of Derry footballers heading back to ision two as either league champions or runners-up. googletag.cmd.push Had Rory Gallaghers side not qualied for the league final, the County Derry Post wouldve contained a bumper edition of the resumption of the club leagues – one of the most eagerly awaited weekend of the year. Those of you on Twitter could do worse things than scroll back through Tyrone Tribulationsmock updates of the Tyrone championship. It was hilarious and, as someone put it to me during the week, in the current climate, sports reporters are almost doubling up as the positive part of the media partnership. All sectors of the GAA fraternity were selecting their ious teams. Listing a team comprising from players under assorted conditions. For example, Tomaacutes Brady listed the best Ballymaguigan  players he had ever played with. There will be no family stre, with brother Seanwas listed at number . googletag.cmd.push Niall Conway selected a team of the best players he had ever managed. Conway steered Ballymaguigan to the  intermediate championship. Of Tomas selection, Gary Coleman and Andrew McCartney were both on Conways list. ONE PLAYER PER CLUB It was where that I got sucked into a GAA debate. I found myself tagged in a tweet by Castledawsongoalkeeper Aidan McLaughlin. During his time with the Derry minors, Aidan was the only one that came to close to selector Noel McFeely, in terms of passion for the Oakleaf jersey. We soon realised on the steps of Casement, when the minor team sat to watch the seniors after our game was over. Chris McCann named a Derry team from the players he had actually saw playing. The one rule- and it was a savage one – it was one player per club. A ridiculous idea, but Aidan challenged Mickey Wilson, Paul McIntyre, Conan Doherty and myself to our selections. I immediately checked in. “This will be handy enough,” I thought. I adopted the same strategy as my former wing man from underage coaching days – Gerry Jokin McEldowney. “Well fill in the strongest spine, and see from there,” he would say. Te first Derry man on my list was easy – Anthony Tohill. In my view, he is the most complete player ever to play the game. He won both throw-ins the day Derry demolished Down in the  opener. He could catch with the best, had the scoring prowess other midfielders didnt come close to and had the athleticism to match his skill. My first problem was, getting Tohill, McGilligan and Fergal Doc into the same team. I took a cop-out by slotting Tohill to wing-forward – where he won a league medal in  – to accommodate the other two. One of them was McGilligan, who was one of the fastest players on the Derry  at the time and a man mountain of a man. Jack Sheedy was still nursing some of his war wounds months later. That brings me to the other. Why have Derry being struggling of late  One main reason has been their inability to final a replacement for Doc and Patsy Bradley. I remember watching the  All-Ireland Quarter-final when the Dubs beat Derry. Big Fergal was immense. When the final whistle sounded, he collapsed to the ground yards away from seat in the front of the Cusack stand. You often hear managers tell players to run until you can run no more and theyll scrape you up and carry you off. That was one of those days and Fergal Doherty was that man. The big loser to the one player per club rule was Bellaghys Damian Cassidy. He was majestic. His performance in the Ulster final in  was always stick out in my memory. In attack, the first name on the list was Paddy Bradley. He has been Derrys best forward of all-time. He had that swagger that all the top forwards need. The Glenullin man had a sweet left foot and developed his right to a level that had defenders guessing. But once he turned onto his left, he didnt need to look at the posts, it always sailed over. For me, what set him apart was his first touch. All aspiring players, should take note – the ball always stuck. Defenders didnt get a second snf. Even last year in a rare appearance against Drumsurn, he still had his touch. PURE PASSION In defence, Tony Scullion was the first man on the team-sheet. Like Bradley, it wasnt because he was the only player from his club in consideration, it was just because he was both brilliant and inspirational. That block he made in the  Ulster final was just one aspect of it. He played football with a smile on his face. If anyone has a bigger passion for the Derry jersey, Id love to see it. There was a video on social media recently from Derrys The men who won Maguire footage. Scud recalls Derrys homecoming and Maghera being bleck with people. His eyes were jumping out of his head as spoke. My mind raced back to an interview I did with him last year. When recalling how he marked Declan Bonner, Scullion jumped out of his armchair and danced around the living room, with his arms out. Its a moment I will never forget. The problem with Chris McCanns rule was how limited it was. Henry Downey versus Johnny McGurk. Paul McFlynn and Johnny McBride. Chrissy McKaigue or Patsy Bradley. Who do you pick from McKeever, McGilligan and Geoffrey McGonigle  There was only one runner for the goalkeeper jersey, so Enda Gormley wasnt going to get a look in either. Thats the beauty of picking teams. “You are all entitled to your opinion, but mine is the only one that matters,” the affable John Rafferty told the Slaughtneil players one night after training. Paul McIntyre and Conan Doherty have also made their selection. Mickey Wilson is a Down man, so we will let him away with it. As for Aidan McLaughlin, you called us out. Its your turn to nail your colours to the mast. DERRY TEAM: Damien McCusker,Sean Marty Lockhart, Tony Scullion, Gary Coleman,Paul McFlynn, Henry Downey, Chrissy McKaigue,Fergal Doherty, Brian McGilligan,Anthony Tohill, Damian Barton, Sean Leo McGoldrick, Paddy Bradley, Dermot Heaney, Enda Muldoon.

If I lose money on this, I lose money on this.Im not one to shout from the rooftopsbut I am very proud of it and I dont think we could have done a better job.His new album Home was produced byPaul Casey with Johnny McCullough on piano, Liam Bradleyon drums, Paul Cutlfe on whistles, pipes and saxaphone,Nicky Scott on double bass and backing vocals by Lauren Doherty and Liam BradleyGeorgehas been hard at work for the last year- touring the States, supporting Phil Coulter and headlining the Ulster Hall with a  piece choir.My parents were so proud, they just couldnt believe it, he recalls.My first big solo performance was singing Bring Him Home at the Waterside Theatre when I was .My mum was terried and she was saying I cant deal with this, aww thats my wain, he laughs.My dad was the opposite. He just couldnt wait to see me perform and its still the same now.Georges father and namesake is a former Derry City FC player, and his uncle PeterHuttoncaptained the squad for  years.All my uncles and my dad played football, but it didnt quite work out for me, he says with a smile.I always loved it though.Georges parentsGeorgeand Ann have  children and raised their family in Creggans Butcher Street before moving to Troy Park in .My mum always wanted to maintain that link with Creggan and thats why I went to St Eugene s Primary School and after school Id go my grannys house in Circular Road in Creggan Heights or my aunties house in Butcher Street.Georgehad always wanted to go to St Columbs College, but his plans changed after he didnt get the mark he needed in his +.I remember crying eyes about that, he admits.I went to St Patricks and St Brigidsin Claudy instead and that was a good experience and then I did go the College to do my A-Levels.My brother had been deputy headboy so I felt I had to follow in his footsteps and after about two or three weeks I got made a prefect.There were lads who had been at the school for a lot longer than me and they were saying this is a joke, he laughs.They werent one bit amused.George is classically trained and has been taught by Derry’s Eoin O’Callaghan and Ciaacuteran Kelly and Mexican Tenor Benito Rodriguez who is married to Derry singer Laura Rodriquez nee Sheeran.Last year he was a judge on the BBC show All Together Now and his first album Chapter One was met with critical acclaim,.Georgefinished up supporting Phil Coulters tour with a show at St Patricks Cathedral in Dublin on January , where he got the seal of approval from one of hismusic idolsOne ofmy biggest influences growing up was Luke Kelly and the Dubliners and the only surviving member, John Sheahan, was performing that night.Hes  and still performing and Ive followed that man for years and I got to sing with him.He came up to me afterwards and said keep nurturing your gt, youve got such a good voice and that was just an amazing moment for me.Dery born pianist Fergal Murray was also playing on Phils tour.I thought that was great because it was like three generations of St Columbs College pupils, me in my s, Fergal in his s and Phil in his s, saysGeorge.Phil later tweeted thatGeorgewas the only support act in his y career to get standing ovations each night.Georgeis very grateful for his fellow Derry mans support and guidance and calls him his mentor.For him to contact me and take a chance on me is massive.Hes a fantastic mentor and well be doing another tour together this winter and theres a few other things in the pipeline that I cant talk about yet.I look at Phil and hes a man who is just not going to stop.He released a book at the end of last year and one of the things I admire about him is that he has never been afraid to take a chance.Thats something Ive learned to start doing.Such a chance presented itself whenGeorgewas asked to be a judge on BBC NI SChool Choir of the Year competition alongside the Richard Marr of BBC Radio Ulster and the Ulster Orchestra, Ciaran Scullion head of Arts Council NI and conductor Lynsey Callaghan.Georgeadmits he struggled with imposter syndrome at the start of the process.It was a great experience and it was really nice to be asked, he says.But i was surrounded by these amazing people and then theres me,GeorgeHutton.Its such a wonderful experience to find yourself sitting amongst these people and I just had to remind myself the BBC had asked me to do it for a reason and that I was there on merit.I feel more confident being on stage singing than I do having to judge.Choirs have played a big part in bringingGeorgeto the world stage. googletag.cmd.push He sang in the school choir at St Eugenes PS, but fell away from music as a teenager before finding his voice again aged , first in the Encore Contemporary Choir, followed by the Ulster University Choir.The Ulster University Choir changed things for me, he says.Dr Sean Ryan was the musical director and it was him who encouraged me to take this furtherI joined the BBC Youth Chorus at  and then I went to Dublin and joined Anuna which was my first real taste of touring.You learn a lot in choirs and you make a lot of friends.You are learning and developing all the time.You get better at reading music and your ear improves and thats all completely transferable to being a soloist.There were so many people at that time telling me that this was what I needed to do.Georgegot his big break signing with the Five Irish Tenors when he was in his early s, and his cousin the singer songwriter NoellaHuttonwas on hand to help and guide him.Shes a really successful singer and had supported Sheryl Crow and been signed to labels like Universal so she really knows the industry, he says.She said to me what does it say in your contact  Are they giving you this, are they giving you that I said dont worry its with Columbia and she said I dontcare who its with, you need to know whats in your contract.Thats what I love about Noella. She takes no shit!Just before the corona virusstruckGeorgeticked another item off his bucket list singing with The Priests in DerrysSt Columbs Cathedral where he was accompanied by pianist Ruth McGinley.Id always wanted to perform with Ruth, shes widely regarded as one of the best pianists in the world.Shes used to playing Rachmaninoff and she was accompanying me, he laughs.For nowGeorgeis keeping busy plugging his album online and enjoying spending time with Megan.The most important thing is peoples health, he says.My brother Christy is a doctor and has a private clinic in Belfast but hes going back to help the NHS, which is going to be terrying.Im just down here in Navan going for walksIm grateful that I have an album to plug and something to give me a creative outlet.Georges second album Home is out now on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours. Irsquove got comments from America, Netherlands, Europe, Australia.ldquoNormally our St Patrickrsquos Day consists of going to mass in Castlewellan, then heading to the Lodge and entertaining the community until lunchtime where everybody comes in for a bit of craic. Then we take the grandkids around ious venues where they all play and then itrsquos back home at about pm.Terry is the father of three daughters, the eldest being Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell, whose son Ruaacuteiriacute is currently the youngest ever over- All-Ireland Uilleann piper.

He plans to perform songs with an emigration flavour such as Song For Ireland, My Fatherrsquos House, Boston Rose and a medley of Rambles of Spring The Old Dungarvan Oak.ldquoThe songs are touching a chord with people who are far away from family at home so Irsquom getting a lot of requests, nearly too many to do all of them. I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled. A lot of people are thanking me for lting their spirits and taking their minds of the situation now. The reason Irsquom keeping it going is for the health and wellbeing of the people in the community. The response Irsquove got from people in Downpatrick has been amazing.ldquoSadly, Irsquom very conscious that I hope that the people who are listening to me now will still be listening to me in six monthsrsquo time.Like many other people who are in self-isolation now, Terry is thinking of better days ahead.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be great to go on to a football field and host a massive concert after this is all over to say thank you to all those NHS and key workers who are looking after us all, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot know how long this is going to last, so in the meantime Irsquom going try and continue to sing an odd old song.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin.

They say anyone who needs assistance of this kind should contact other agencies.Downpatrick foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said the organisation regretted the changes it has had to make.When referrals are made, the name of the person, size of their family and address will be logged, alongside other helpful information including locations, post codes and details including the colour of their front door and what local landmarks they may be close to.Mrs Lennon said that the food parcels will be left outside the clientrsquos door and volunteers will not be entering peoplersquos homes.In addition, she confirmed that deliveries will be made every Wednesday and that as food supplies may be limited, the volunteers can only distribute what they have.Under the new guidelines, food donations can only be made at dedicated collection points at the Asda and Supervalu stores in Downpatrick at the Ballydugan retail park and Ballymote shopping centres respectively.Mrs Lennon said donations could no longer be left at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church.She said volunteers continue to be grateful for the support of many people to help needy families at what are challenging times for everyone.Two weeks ago, the foodbank launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic but has had to abort this to comply with Public Health Agency advice.Volunteers will still be relying on peoplersquos generosity to help them cope with demand in what are unprecedented times and have been pleased with the publicrsquos response to help them continue helping families in need.The foodbank hopes that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores as they are expecting increasing demand on the service.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.The Pantry Foodbank in Newcastle has also implemented a home delivery service to ensure the health and safety of volunteers, with all deliveries taking place on Thursday.Further information about Newcastle deliveries is available at   or via the foodbank Facebook page.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Until Saturday, he had never won the Irish Cup.He said: “I played in the final for the Reds versus the Crues in . We were beaten - by a Mark Dickson goal. That’s my actual cup final kit and runners-up medal used in the video we made.“The best I got domestically was a couple of runners-up in the league and I won a couple of Co Antrim Shields and played in Cltonville’s first ever win in Europe. I scored in two games against FC Dinaburg.”Asked who came up with the idea of holding an Irish Cup final in their back garden, Kieran said: “My two kids are football nuts. Keagan plays for Crumlin Star and Killian plays at Cltonville so my we Roisin is tormented by us. Our cup final was just a bit of fun.”He said he and his sons were missing football a lot but had come up with ways to fill the void: “It’s handy having a big garden to play in and great for kids but to be honest I’m old school. For me kids kicking a ball against a wall and doing keepy ups is the best practice.”Kieran, who works for a children’s charity – MACS NI – supporting children and young people, retired from playing last year at Crewe United where he linked up with his friends Eamon McCarthy and Ronan Scannell.He was also behind an Irish League Masters event in Larne last month which had to be cancelled.

Please try again later.Submitting...Yesterday Mr Murphy told MLAs that his department had offered to help the Department of Health and had secured approval from the Cabinet Office in Whitehall before attempting to procure the items – which were ultimately coming from China – via Dublin.He said that Ms O’Neill’s claim that an order had been placed “was in fact correct – we had in fact placed an order at no stage had I said anything about signing contracts. I said we had placed an order.”When asked about comments from Justice Minsiter Naomi Long and Ms O’Neill about the supposed order, he said: “I can’t account for the interetation of what I say by other people...”Putting it to Mr Murphy that Ms O’Neill had erroneously told the Assembly that a contract had been signed, committee chairman Steve Aiken asked: “Who is right – the deputy First Minister or you ”Mr Murphy said: “Well, you would have to ask the deputy First Minister how she chose to interpret that. I was very clear we had placed an order. You suggest that in your view of how business is doneyou place an order you have signed a contract. So perhaps the deputy First Minister had the same understanding of placing an order as you do.”Mr Murphy said that Northern Ireland had been “piggybacking” on the Irish Government and had made an agreement about how much would be paid.He said that his department was “in the process...of transferring that money when we became aware that there was a question mark over the supply lines that they had established”.Drawing attention to the fact that Mr Murphy was always publicly vague about what had been ordered, TUV leader Jim Allister highlighted that signicant quantities of the PPE coming out of China has been found to be unfit for use.He asked Mr Murphy: “You were going to write a cheque for £m for goods you hadn’t seen ”Mr Murphy replied: “Well, I think that anybody who places an order like that from China is basing it on the fact that there are people on the ground to try to establish the quality of it, the quantity of it and...we were operating on the back of an established supply line.”Mr Allister asked: “So before you saw a single apron, or mask, or anything, you were ready, about to send the money to Dublin. That’s correct, is it ”Mr Murphy said: “Yes.”He said it was “a matter of regret” that someone from inside government had briefed the media, revealing that the order had fallen through, because there was a “proper place for everyone to receive that”, which was via the Executive.Mr Aiken concluded by saying that, having heard the evidence, he was “content” and had “no doubt that you were doing your best and were trying to do your best in particularly trying circumstances”.Bad news came hours before O’Neill attack on SwannThe timeline set out by Conor Murphy yesterday reveals that Sinn Féin was told that its minister’s supposed order had collapsed just hours before deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill used a high profile TV interview to attack Health Minister Robin Swann.Last Thursday evening Ms O’Neill created a political storm when she dispensed with collective government responsibility and told Mark Carruthers on The View that Mr Swann had been “too slow” and was “slavishly” following a flawed Westminster strategy.The led to a predictable backlash from the UUP and the DUP and dominated the headlines.However, yesterday Mr Murphy revealed that just hours before Ms O’Neill did that interview his department – which for several days had been receiving reports that the PPE for which Ms O’Neill had wrongly claimed there was a signed contract may not arrive – was told that the items were definitely not coming.Mr Murphy said that on Thursday he had “received confirmation that the order would not be fulfilled through that route”.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be.

We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

For reasons of patient confidentiality we are not able to discuss specic cases of care from the hospice or from the community nursing care we provide.ldquoOur hospice staff and nursing teams across Cardf and the Vale are very much on the frontline and have an important job in keeping patients out of hospital to relieve pressure on the NHS. That is important now more than ever given the coronavirus crisis. The health and wellbeing of our patients, their loved ones, and our staff is our top priority and across the hospice and community we are taking steps to protect them. This includes the use of PPE and, in-line with other providers of care, including the NHS, we have amended our visiting rules at the hospice.ldquoWith regards PPE, unfortunately, our hospice and community nursing service have been facing the same issues as the NHS in terms of getting all the equipment they need. We are screening patients with a phone call before attending their homes and staff will wear the appropriate PPE equipment during every household visit. However, we can only do this when we have the right PPE equipment available and are grateful to have recently received support from our colleagues at the Cardf and the Vale University Health Board to gain access to some PPE through their supply, for which we give our thanks.ldquoHowever we are always in need of more supplies to continue to provide vital end of le care to people living with a terminal illness, especially at this dficult time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Chris McConville : User “I did most of The Burn by memory, the general layout, the characteristic carpets and places like the outdoor area and cloakroom, but I admit I used some photos I had for small details like lights and paintings etc.as you would expect, a few messy Jager bombs does the memory no good! “I used to play Minecraft years and years ago, probably from the ages of - or so but I slowly went off the game as I was simply growing out of it.”Chris, who currently works in Asda in Portadown, said: “One of my friends I used to go to school with, recently re-created Ma Berry’s Bar in Portadown, as the proud local I am, I could not let Lurgan go unrepresented in this, so I thought “Here’s one for the Lurgan bies”, “I honestly only meant it as a joke between a few friends and I uploaded it on the end of my work break. After about  hours or so of the video being on my Facebook page, I turned on my phone to discover it had absolutely blew up.Chris McConville : User “My Dad went in to work the following day in Interface in Lurgan, and his workmates had seen the video in a Whatsapp group chat. It was insane. “I think my greatest achievement in my le so far has been the shoutout The Burn gave me on their Facebook page, I thinkI won the lottery tomorrow I would still be more excited at the fact that I made The Burn’s Facebook Page.”Chris added: “On a more serious note I think the video actually resonated with a lot of people, ranging from younger people itching to get their social lives back to older people who maybe haven’t been to The Burn in years.“It served as a kind of a throwback of sorts, which was really interesting to see. I’m just glad that some people might have got a bit of a laugh at this, especially during the stressful times we are all going through at the moment.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
