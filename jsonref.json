Huawei\u0027s founder and CEO, former Communist soldier Ren Zhengfei (pictured), has refused to westernise his company\u0027s name to show his patriotism and loyalty to Beijing, as many believe         Huawei became the centre of the political tensions between China and the United States after Washington claimed that Huawei\u0027s gear could be used by China to spy on Americans - allegations Huawei has repeatedly denied. The brand is a key in the two nation\u0027s trade warIt is said that Mr Ren, who founded the business at the age of 43, decided on the name after seeing a Communist slogan on the wall which can be translated into \u0027put China in your heart, do great things\u0027. Huawei is the abbreviation of the slogan. Mr Ren was born in rural Guizhou Province to teacher parents. When he first established Huawei, he had to work - and sleep - into a run-down factory in Shenzhen with a dozen other colleagues to develop their own telecommunication devices. With the huge success of the company, Mr Ren, now 74, is one of the richest men in China and estimated to be worth $1.8 billion (£1.42 billion) by Forbes.He has even splurged 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion, £1.1 billion) building a fake European town for 30,000 of his workers near Shenzhen.Last August, Huawei beat Apple to become the world\u0027s second largest smartphone maker after South Korea\u0027s Samsung.          Huawei has sold more smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of this year than AppleIt has held on to the title of the world\u0027s second largest smartphone vendor in the first quarter of this year, beating Apple by 3.8 per cent in worldwide market share, according to a survey from research company Gartner. The feat was achieved by Huawei\u0027s strong performance in China, said the report.Huawei became the centre of the political tensions between China and the United States after the Trump government claimed that Huawei\u0027s gear could be used by China to spy on Americans - allegations Huawei has repeatedly denied. U.S. President Trump has banned Huawei from U.S. networks. Mr Ren\u0027s daughter Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, was arrested in Canada in December and is facing criminal charges in the U.S.         Mr Ren\u0027s daughter Meng Wanzhou (pictured) is facing criminal charges in the U.S. Ms Meng was arrested in Vancouver by Canadian police in December under the request of Washington       Huawei has been under scrutiny in the West after Washington claimed that the firm\u0027s gear could be used by China to spy on Americans - allegations Huawei has repeatedly deniedMs Meng, widely considered as Ren\u0027s heiress, is accused of using a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Huawei has denied the accusation.Last month after Beijing and Washington failed to reach an agreement on tariffs during the trade war talks, the U.S. issued orders to ban Huawei from buying parts and technologies from American suppliers. A 90-day reprieve was later issued. Then Google said it would stop providing Huawei with its license to use Android, the operating system that powers all smartphones made by the Chinese firm and its sub-brand Honor. Beijing branded the U.S. sanctions as \u0027economic bullying\u0027.  Huawei claimed that it would use its backup components and the U.S. trade sanctions would not affect the company\u0027s continuous service to its clients. A Huawei sub-brand unveiled its next generation phones last month despite the brand\u0027s uncertain future. A senior Huawei executive has also claimed that the company\u0027s own operating system could be launched as early as this autumn.  Huawei has filed a motion in the U.S. asking the court to rule on whether it is constitutional for the U.S. to implement a military spending provision that bars the government and its contractors from using its equipment.How to pronounce Huawei - YouTube"},{"url":null,"title":"Devon dog owner calls 999 Labrador cross Luis gets head stuck cat flap","story":"Share this article \u0027We carried on talking when he must have put his head through too far.

The front page of the Daily Mail\u0027s June 5 edition 1944 was news that Rome was safely in Allied hands by midnight of June 4, the first European city to be freed of Nazi control. A small article from Daily Mail Radio Station warned that \u0027D-Day posters\u0027 were being stuck to billboards in Paris warning German people living there that the Allied forces were due to invade. The British gave several false dates as part of their Operation Bodyguard to mislead the Germans on when they would land          A front page story from June 5 1944 tells of how a Mail correspondent risked being pelted with mortar bombs to cover stories from the front line in Rome as the Allied forces reclaimed it from the Nazis. Stories from D-Day week focused mainly on the liberation of Rome as the Normandy landings remained top secret          Page two of the Mail\u0027s edition from June 5 1944 has a lead story headlined \u0027Rome!\u0027 telling of how British troops were due to march through the centre of the Italian capital after taking it from Nazi forces. Another story told of how Americans paid 10 times the TV licence fee Britons did to watch the BBC          Page three of June 5\u0027s edition tells an unfortunate story about a female teleprint operator who was working for the Associated Press in Fleet Street in 1944. She accidentally delivered the news US President Eisenhower had announced an allied landing in Europe while she was practising for the momentous day, sending \u0027five continent shaking\u0027. She apologised from her home in Camden, north west London. Another article describes a Cambridgeshire town that dressed in second-hand clothes for a thanksgiving service. The page also includes an advert for Barkers department store in High Street Kensington, which now houses the new Daily Mail offices          The final page of the edition on June 5 told of how forts were being hit by Allied forces in Boulogne, France and also featured a special report from \u0027the Mail\u0027s man\u0027 reporting from the front line in Soviet Russia. Still on the subject of Russia, a short story informed readers of how tomatoes grown from Russian seeds were being planted across Britain  Tuesday 6, 1944: ADVANCE SPEEDING BEYOND TIBER         Page one: On D-Day itself, there was no mention of the Allied forces landing on the beaches of Normandy. The paper went to press in the early hours of June 6, with the invasion still a well-kept secret to prevent any intelligence leaks.

The paper went to press in the very early hours of Tuesday, June 6, 1944, before news of the invasion arrived in London          In its leader column for the day, on page two, the newspaper welcomed the \u0027famous victory\u0027 in Rome, likening it to the defeat of Napoleon.

There is also a photograph of jubilant Italians cheering on the allied troops as they made their way through Rome          There was grimmer news about food shortages in Paris on the back page of the paper that came out on June 6, 1944 - the day that would be immortalised as D-Day, although readers would not have yet known that.

It\u0027s a secret codeword. So he left.\u0027He told my mother about it and she said she just wanted her baby to have a name.         Staff at the registry office initially told Bert he could not name his son after the military operation as it was a \u0027secret codeword\u0027. Pictured: Dee-Day as a toddler\u0027So he went back the next day with a copy of a newspaper and told them it\u0027s not a secret anymore, those Germans know all about it.\u0027He cleverly told them he wanted to spell it Dee-Day and eventually they let him.\u0027He has always worn the name as a badge of honour, visiting Normandy on his birthday 10 times in total to be a part of D-Day celebrations.But at times, the name has hindered him.Dee-Day said: \u0027When I was a teenager, I couldn\u0027t lie about my age - everyone knew when D-Day was.\u0027So if I was at the pub trying to get served while underage, they knew. And if I was trying to chat up an older girl, they\u0027d know my age because of the name!\u0027And if I had been out with my friends causing trouble, policemen and other people would always remember me because of the name - not any of my friends.\u0027Other than that, I\u0027ve never had any problems with it. Everyone knows me in the town and it\u0027s just been accepted by everyone.\u0027Everyone knows me as Dee-Day. I think some people have thought my surname is Day and the D is the initial of my first name.\u0027Whenever I tell anyone my name, I do always end up having to tell them the story of how I got it as well.\u0027His middle name, Rodney, is after HMS Rodney – the Royal Navy battleship his uncle Tom served on during the war.Dee-Day, from Hastings in East Sussex, first visited Normandy aged 18, and his last visit was two years ago. During those visits, he has proved popular among veterans because of his name.He said: \u0027There was an ex-paratrooper there one year who was selling a book about his story.\u0027People buying his book saw me being interviewed on French television because of my name and they started asking me to sign their books.          When Bert told his wife May, pictured together, about his suggestion she said she \u0027just wanted her baby to have a name\u0027         For the most part, Dee-Day has had no name-related issues - except when attempting to buy a drink underage, as everyone knew exactly how old he was. Pictured: Dee-Day\u0027s brother Kenny, now 87, mother May, Dee-Day, father Bert, and brother Bertie\u0027Eventually, the man came over and even asked me to sign a copy for him with my name, date of birth and Hastings - then joked for me to go as people weren\u0027t asking for his signature!\u0027His last trip to Normandy in 2017 was with his son - who he also named Dee-Day - and only grandchild Aaron, 24.Dee-Day Jr, 54, went on to serve as a Corporal in the Royal Green Jackets for six years.On choosing his eldest child\u0027s name, father-of-three Dee-Day said: \u0027If I wasn\u0027t going to call him Dee-Day, somebody else was.\u0027No one ever really questioned his name growing up. I know so many people in the town so they all understood why he was called that.\u0027When he decided to join the Army, I asked him if he wanted to change his name but he said no.\u0027They all get nicknames in there anyway, and when he came back from training I asked him what are you called now then?\u0027He was going to be called Chalky White, but because of what his name meant, everyone called him Dee-Day anyway.\u0027Dee-Day\u0027s daughter Avaline, 53, also served for six years as a Lance Corporal within the security and intelligence of the Army.He will have the D-Day heroes in his mind on Thursday, but will not be making the trip over the Channel - instead enjoying a meal with family.Dee-Day added: \u0027I\u0027m lucky just to be alive now, as so many of my friends and people I\u0027ve known all my life have died, so I need to spend my birthday with my family.         He said: \u0027Everyone knows me as Dee-Day. I think some people have thought my surname is Day and the D is the initial of my first name.\u0027 Pictured, Dee-Day as a teenager              Dee-Day even named his own son Dee-Day - who went on to serve as a Corporal in the Royal Green Jackets for six years. Pictured: left, Bert, right, May         He has lived in Hastings all his life, and has been running his antiques shop - a stone\u0027s throw from his parents\u0027 old home - for the past 32 years. Pictured: Dee-Day as a child.\u0027But I will be thinking of our heroes. I\u0027ve visited Normandy and Dunkirk so many times and, after spending a lot of time with the veterans, you could not imagine what they went through.\u0027When you know the damage a gun can do, to fire it at someone must have been so tough. It must have been unbearable for them.\u0027Dee-Day\u0027s parents\u0027 home in Hastings had been bombed by German forces just days before the D-Day landings, and so they had to move into another home in which May gave birth to him.He has lived in Hastings all his life, and has been running his antiques shop - a stone\u0027s throw from his parents\u0027 old home - for the past 32 years.Dee-Day runs the shop alongside Beverley, 63, his wife of seven years.May was a \u0027scrubber\u0027 who cleaned people\u0027s houses in Hastings Old Town, a poor area of the seaside town.Bert was relieved of National Service because of his job as a fisherman, and he also formed part of the local lifeboat crew.He was the head boat launcher and worked on the Cyril and Lilian Bishop - which was used in the Dunkirk evacuations in 1940.Dee-Day has invested much of his time - and around £40,000 - in getting the lifeboat back to its home Paris three years ago.The boat is thought to have helped save thousands of British and ally troops from the beaches.Dee-Day said: \u0027That boat is so special. It carries a lot of meaning for me because of its history.\u0027Because the naval ships were too big to get ashore, lifeboats were used to take troops from shore to the vessels. They carried around 50 people a time. She would have saved thousands of lives.\u0027Dee-Day has also held a keen interest in collecting military gear including badges, uniforms and weapons.He added: \u0027I\u0027ve always had an interest in the military, but I think more so because of my name and the story behind it.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c01f769592d802c74c106323a491021a2b2efc1/0_147_5976_3584/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe7af6c6ac25339cf20b6b48bb890d2","title":"2019 wellcome photography prize entries","story":"The annual awards celebrate the best images of science around the worldA human face lies inert on a surgical tray as if staring up at the team of doctors hovering over it. It has taken them 16 hours of precise, painstaking work to remove it from a 31-year-old female donor, who had died three days earlier. A few seconds after photographer Lynn Johnson captured this extraordinary moment, plastic surgeons in the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, began the second phase of a procedure that lasted around 30 hours in total. When it was completed, 21 year-old Katie Stubblefield became the youngest person to receive a successful full face transplant.Taken in 2017 as part of a bigger series documenting Stubblefield’s groundbreaking surgical transformation, Katie’s New Face (2017) is one of several arresting images that have made the shortlist for the 2019 Wellcome Photography prize. The aim of the award is to celebrate “compelling imagery that captures stories of health, medicine and science”. Composed of four categories – Social Perspectives, Hidden Worlds, Medicine in Focus and Outbreaks – the shortlist perhaps predictably favours documentary and photojournalism. There are some surprises, though, not least the often beautiful abstractions of David Linstead’s microscopic image of the capillaries of a human fingertip that had been injected with red ink.From its inception, photography has been utilised to illuminate the mysteries of science and medicine, with Victorian pioneers such as Henry Fox Talbot and Auguste Adolphe Bertsch creating microscopic studies of insects and plants that often resembled ornate line drawings. As the category Hidden Worlds shows, that tradition of cutting-edge experimentation continues apace with an advanced image-mapping of HIV infection undertaken by a team of research scientists that allows us to see four representations of the same cluster of 100,000 cells from a rhesus monkey.In the same section, Simon Norfolk and Klaus Thymann’s man-altered landscape Shroud, Rhône Glacier, shows the range of approaches and the breadth of subject matter that the prize celebrates. It could be mistaken at first glance for a signature work by the conceptual land artist Christo, famous for his wrapping of monumental buildings and stretches of landscape in fabric. It is, in fact, an attempt by environmentalists to slow down the melting of the Swiss glacier, the heavy thermal material reflecting heat and light that would otherwise destroy the ice. It is an image of an undertaking that seems both surreal and slightly desperate, but the ecological context is calamitous: the Rhône Glacier has lost 350 metres (1,150ft) in ice thickness since 1856 and around 40 metres in the last decade alone.Sex and death inevitably feature and, again, it is in the Hidden Worlds category where the contrast is most dramatic. Simone Cerio’s wonderfully tender and intimate series, Love Givers, is represented by a single understated image of two semi-naked women lying on a bed. Shot from above, it suggests the casual intimacy of longterm lovers, but one of them, Debora, is the first officially sanctioned sexual assistant in Italy, whose role is “to support disabled people to explore intimate practices”.Cerio has described her project as “a physical and mental journey” that challenges our perception of the disabled and their most intimate needs. “Sexual assistance is a technique of psychophysical approach to disabled people, based on massages, kisses, visual contacts and erotic stimulation,” she elaborates on her Facebook page, “This project is an opportunity, perhaps the only way for disabled people to have such an experience.”Luis Henry Agudelo Cano has already won second place in the current affairs and news category of the 2018 Sony world photography awards for his black and white series Young People Who Beautify Death. The single image from it included here gives you a sense of its almost ghostly intimacy. Entitled The Morgue, and shot in Colombia in 2017, it is a multiple exposure of one of the young people who are trained to, as Cano puts it, “salvage the beauty of the deceased, that those who love them can always remember them”. Like his fellow students, this young man is being trained in postmortem techniques to erase the scars and wounds of violent death so that the victims of Colombia’s prolonged paramilitary-fuelled violence can be viewed by their relatives.Among the several captured moments of intimacy on display in the shortlist, perhaps the strangest is by Dmitry Kostyukov. His portrait of an elderly resident of a nursery facility near Paris is tenderly observed, but it challenges all our received notions of what constitutes care and, indeed, tenderness. The woman is cradling Zora, a robot remotely controlled by a nurse as an aid to “communication, comfort and entertainment” of the residents. Many of them ignore Zora, while others take her to their hearts as they would a child.Like many of the images that have made it on to the shortlist, Zora the robot care-giver is a glimpse of a future in which new technologies such as advanced robotics and artificial intelligence will inform our lives in ways that, until recently, we would have scarcely imagined outside of the realm of science fiction. It is these glimpses of a future that is already here that makes the selection so compelling. That, and the evidence of the deep humanity that still underlies so much of the work done by those at the forefront of advances in health, medicine and science.All the winning and shortlisted entries will go on show at the Lethaby Gallery, London, 4-13 July. Category prizes and the overall winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on 3 July 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d318e14c02783dfab5b2e98b614afa24070d18/0_143_2770_1662/master/2770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=625264f2ab3fa34dcbb1b370e475752b","title":"werner bischof 1950s america in colour in pictures","story":"The acclaimed Magnum photographer Werner Bischof’s images of 1950s America are shown for the first time in an exhibition devoted to his USA series.

A total of 346 people died in the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters.The manufacturer said it had not been told of any issues during flying regarding the potentially faulty parts. It said there were 20 737 Max airplanes that were likely to have the defective parts, and that airlines would check an additional 159 planes. Another 133 of the 737 NG model, a predecessor to the Max, will also be checked.The FAA said a complete failure of the part, called a leading-edge slat track, would not cause a crash, but could cause aircraft damage in flight. Airlines operating the affected NG planes need to remove faulty parts within 10 days, but can continue to operate them in the meantime.However, the wider worries around the 737 Max led to a $1bn (£790m) order being put on hold on Monday, as the Azerbaijan airline AZAL postponed an order for 10 planes.Boeing has yet to finalise a software upgrade, which it hopes will convince regulators that it is safe for the plane to return to the skies. Although investigations continue, a controversial automated anti-stall system, MCAS, has been implicated in both crashes.Last week, the head of the global airline trade body, IATA, said it would be at least August before the all clear was given, with regulators outside the US having indicated that they will also expect to give separate clearance rather than accept the FAA ruling.However, Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, told reporters at IATA’s AGM in Seoul that it could take six months to restore 737 Max operations, saying: “If it is in the air by Christmas, I’ll be surprised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/162efa5c635c2c79399dbc09b890a371715c29a5/0_196_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17b2d45a28176aabb7e44287629ed7c1","title":"children school 27 years parents evenings pta","story":"School’s out for ever. Just one more week and I will be free. FREE! I cannot tell you how I long for the end of school. You see, in the bizarre sociological experiment that is my life, I have had one child or another in school for about 27 years, and my youngest finishes next week. I have done my time. Obviously I sacrificed my offspring for the sake of my political principles, so these were state schools, of course. I never, ever want to hear another person saying they believe in state education – but just not for their very special child. Pray that I never need to inhale the stench of that angsty hypocrisy again while some dolt explains it is only “natural” to want the best for one’s children – as though I want the worst for mine.Not only do I not understand segregating one’s child in a reinforced bubble I don’t even like school. It wasn’t my thing as a child. Why would it be as a parent? Why do I have to pretend?If you don’t like school, then these really are not the best days of your life. It all feels like a constant interruption of who you are, and no amount of motivational talks on “growth mindset” changes that.As a parent I have watched the evolution of a particular kind of misery that we now impose in the name of “standards”, under both Labour and Tory governments: the slow squeezing of joy from the curriculum, the reduction of art and music, the decimation of languages, the erasing of creativity in the humanities. I have heard of teachers burning out or going under. The one who used to make each kid stand outside for five minutes, because she would not teach a class with more than 30 pupils. The one who used to sob his way through history. The one who gave them all vodka. All of them gone, replaced by “reply teachers” as my children called them.Sad, yes, but I am not sad that I will never have to go to another parents’ evening complete with a list of instructions: “Don’t say anything, don’t make faces, don’t be embarrassing.” No more school quizzes or PTA meetings – or Tinder for people who can’t be bothered, as I call them.Never again will I receive a text about the wrong trainers, an illegal “belly top” or an undone top button. As all schools have suffered this awful academisation, the enforcing of petty rules often seems to be the raison d’etre of education.Never again will I share a cab with an MP who explains how to get my kids into the right school, even though though I don’t live in the catchment area (reader, I did not follow their advice).No more chats with anxious parents who do their kids’ homework but have not got the highest mark. No more French exchanges: “Mum, you have to do a buffet breakfast every morning because that’s what French people eat.” Never again will I offer to take a Parisian teenager anywhere she would like to go, to be met with the answer: “Le Primark.”The gentrification of my part of London is there in the class pictures. Those of my eldest are racially mixed and those of my youngest are not. I see ethnic and social cleansing by property price, and no amount of international evenings at school makes up for that.Sure, I am grateful for the good teachers who have guided us through. I have managed without ever really knowing what a key stage is. I just wanted my kids to be able to read. Most of school is crowd control. Ease with other people, curiosity and the ability to daydream cannot be measured. A* grades tell you what, exactly? What is a good education? One that makes you feel able to go on learning for the rest of your life, not one that sucks the life out of you by cramming and testing. So I am done. School’s out completely, for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73406d2f2f6d8b99339c7a7b444823ce4abab81b/0_54_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ca6b1337e19ce90bb1a8d4de94658b4","title":"china deny tiananmen square","story":"He was just a kid, but he cried like an old man in despair.” Liane was trying hard to steady her emotions when she described to me how she had attempted to hold back a young boy whose unarmed brother had been shot by soldiers during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.Liane was a student from Hong Kong when the 1989 Tiananmen movement erupted and she went to Beijing to support the demonstrations. On the night of 3 June, when 200,000 soldiers equipped with tanks and AK-47s were deployed against unarmed civilians, she was outside the Museum of the Chinese Revolution on the north-east corner of Tiananmen Square. She fainted after she failed to stop the young boy from dashing toward the soldiers, and was carried away covered with blood.“When I regained consciousness, people tried to put me into an ambulance,” Liane recalled. “I told them that I did not need one. A second ambulance came, and again I struggled not to get in.” At that point, a middle-aged female doctor got out of the ambulance, held Liane’s hands and told her: “Child, we need you to return to Hong Kong. We need you to leave alive to tell the world what our government did to us tonight.” Because of the freedom Hong Kong citizens enjoyed before the handover of 1997, citizens of Beijing hoped that Liane would bear witness for them. The fear that the blood would be shed in vain was widely shared by Chinese people that night. One Chinese man asked a Canadian reporter on the street: “Does the world know what happened here?”The despair felt by Chinese people at the time was not misconceived. Although the world’s attention fell on Beijing, the Tiananmen movement had been national in scope, with millions of participants in cities across China. So, immediately after the crackdown the government carried out mass arrests across the nation.Propaganda officers of the People’s Liberation Army took control of all major media in Beijing. Many editors attempted to protect their reporters who were on the ground and saw what was happening (and tried to report what was happening), but the editors themselves were sacked so that the purge could proceed smoothly. Both the editor-in-chief and the director of the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), were dismissed from their posts because of their sympathetic attitudes toward the students.The general secretary of the CCP at the time, Zhao Ziyang, who refused to order the crackdown, was dismissed and lived under house arrest until his death in 2005. General Xu Qinxian, commander of the 38th army of the People’s Liberation Army, who refused to participate in the crackdown, was court-martialled, imprisoned for five years, and expelled from the CCP. These were just some of the immediate consequences.Over the past 30 years, the Beijing regime activated the state machinery to erase or distort any memory of 3 and 4 June. The post-Tiananmen leadership went on to construct an official account that portrayed the movement as a western conspiracy to weaken and ide China, hence justifying its military crackdown as necessary for stability and prosperity, and paving the way for China’s rise. In 2011, China Daily, an official English-language newspaper in Beijing, headlined a story “Tiananmen massacre a myth”, claiming that “Tiananmen remains the classic example of the shallowness and bias in most western media reporting, and of governmental black information operations seeking to control those media. China is too important to be a victim of this nonsense.”Survivors and families of the victims have persisted, however, in disputing these narratives. Among them was Fang Zheng, a college senior who was run over by a tank and lost both legs during the crackdown. I invited Fang and the photographer Jeff Widener, who took the iconic Tank Man photo, to a conference I organised at Harvard in 2014, commemorating the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen. Sitting in his wheelchair, Fang told the packed auditorium that he used to hate the Tank Man photo as the authorities used it to press him to bear false witness: “How come he was not crushed but you were? It must be because you were a rioter.” The authorities pressured Fang to say that he was run over by a car when he refused, he was denied his degree and his graduation certificate.Because the heart-wrenching testimonies of the Tiananmen mothers contradict the official version of what happened they had to be rendered invisible and silent. The mothers are still not allowed to openly mourn their children their continuing demand for an independent investigation for truth and justice is regularly denied. In a heartbreaking recent interview, the mother of Liu Hongtao, a student killed during the massacre, asked forgiveness from her son because his mother and father still cannot openly mourn him.Despite Beijing’s pressure on the Hong Kong press, journalists who covered the Tiananmen movement in Beijing in 1989 recently produced a programme of interviews collectively titled: “I am a journalist: My June 4 story”. It is their contribution to keeping the collective memory alive. Foreign journalists who reported from Beijing in 1989 were also profoundly impacted by their experience. At the Harvard conference, participating western journalists called themselves the “Class of 89”.The legacy of Tiananmen is not something that belongs to China or to the Chinese people alone. It belongs to the world. Human beings’ longing for freedom and the pursuit of truth and justice are without borders. The 4 June military crackdown violated the core of our shared humanity.This is why each year for three decades commemoration activities have been organised in major cities around the world. In Hong Kong, hundreds of thousands have gathered in Victoria Park each 4 June to hold a candlelight vigil to remember those young lives that were violently cut short. This year Liane will be speaking at the vigil, keeping the commitment she made to that ambulance doctor and other citizens on the streets of Beijing 30 years ago. The image of the endless sea of candles has become as iconic as the Tank Man, reminding us that Tiananmen is not just about repression, but also about hope.• Rowena Xiaoqing He is author of Tiananmen Exiles: Voices of the Struggle for Democracy in China"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd6e381232bf98a146e93e24991bbeab224a725a/0_34_4599_2759/master/4599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22202aa703deeed6efafb1df77e3d470","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of elegant","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘elegant’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘elegant’.Share your photos of what elegant means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 5 June at 10am.

Incidentally, if youare feeling brave, skip to 28min 40sec, where even the unromantic Crace gives May until “the middle of 2019, by which stage we will have … some kind of transitional deal”.We are looking, not at the greatest of all nicknames (The Turf Macaroni, because of Grafton’s love of hanging around at horse races), but at one given to Asquith for a habit celebrated in a music-hall song …Mr Asquith says in a manner sweet and calm: Another little drink won’t do us any harm… reader: how would you clue SQUIFFY?Thanks for your clues for CANADA PLUS and of course I adored Chameleonxwords’ “Alan C uploads puzzles, wanting blog insiders’ improbable solution to conundrum?”The runners-up are Peshwari’s not-implausible “Poland invading North American countries is one possible outcome of trade talks” and PeterMooreFuller’s sly “Davis’s aim snookered by Thorburn’s home advantage” the winner is Encota’s ingenious “Trade deal may result in peculiar tax bands, following crazy Brexit withdrawal”.Talking of ingenuity, the audacity award does not seem enough for Porcia’s “MPs mull a spurious unicorns agenda, cake eaten and not, staggeringly, to leave European Single Market and Customs Union with a deal” which, frankly, I think I have checked.

Once the heartland of London’s rave scene, they’re now home to new boutiques and flagship stores. With a focus on craftsmanship, sustainability and conscious consumption, you’ll find design that challenges the status quo and products made to last. From fancy pants to unisex streetwear, sun-drenched LA style to seriously chic wet weather gear, here are eight stores you’ll definitely want to drop into – and dwell.Beija LondonFounded by sisters Abbie Miranda and Mazie Fisher, Beija London is on a mission to revolutionise the way we buy underwear and swimwear. Every elegant, sculptural design comes in three sizing categories, from wire-free bralettes to full support, created to fit and celebrate AA-G cup sizes without ever compromising on style. Having gathered a cult online following, the brand’s first bricks and mortar store is as coolly minimalist as its lingerie, with abundant greenery and plenty of space for fittings. In fact, Beija’s approach is such a breath of fresh air that it almost feels as good as taking your bra off at the end of a long day. Almost.18montroseWith a roll call of labels including Stone Island, Maison Margiela, Rick Owens, Yeezy and Alexander Wang, concept store 18montrose is leading the way in unisex design. Technically, Coal Drops Yard is its third UK outlet (the boutique retailer also has stores in Glasgow and Nottingham), but this is their only London presence, and with more than 450 sq m of space, this is a temple to contemporary streetwear that goes way beyond the hype. The perfect place to get your kicks, and everything else that goes with them.Form\u0026ampThreadEthical, sustainable, sewed by fairly-paid workers in Portugal and packaged in biodegradable materials, everything at Form\u0026ampThread is transparent. Except the clothes. Favouring quality fabrics and muted colours, this understated menswear label creates beautifully timeless pieces think mid-weight cotton twill shirts with off-centre buttons and oversized chest pockets, classic tapered chinos, and discreetly textured socks, all in earthy tones such as brick, pebble, olive and navy.LavenhamLavenham has come a long way. Born in the Suffolk town of the same name, this thoroughly British brand has been making quilted gilets and jackets since 1969. The swinging 60s might be long gone, but this premium outerwear has stood the test of time. Whether you’re after an ironic city twist on rural style or just something warm and stylish to walk the dog in, all emphasis here is on quality, comfort and durability. They even offer a repairs service.LPOLWife and husband team Katy Bell and John Maskell graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2006, so it’s fitting that their shop and studio is now based in Coal Drops Yard, only a stone’s throw from the world-famous art school. LPOL’s sleek totes, rucksacks and satchels are all crafted with a zero-waste philosophy every scrap of leather is reused to make prototypes, wallets or bag tags. The brand name stands for Lost Property of London – although you won’t want to lose yours.Outsiders StoreAs the name suggests, Outsiders Store wants to keep you warm and dry when you’re outside. Stocking some of the biggest and coolest names in adventure wear, from pastel Patagonia anoraks to Blundstone boots and portable coffee makers, it’s a one-stop shop for happy campers, urban hikers and all that lies between. While the first Outsiders Store opened in Liverpool, the Coal Drops Yard boutique finds the retailer a second site in the heart of the capital, and home to a beautifully curated selection that’ll have even the most fashion-devoted Londoner yearning for a style excursion beyond zone five.TwiinIf you’ve ever crushed on that photo of Farrah Fawcett on a skateboard, Twiin is a must-visit. London’s first LA-inspired concept store, influenced by similarities between the two cities’ style tribes (we’re flattered), the store stocks a mix of luxe contemporary and vintage pieces. While the furnishings are mid-century, the ethos is pure 2019: socially-conscious brands, golden lighting and Instagram opportunities all over the shop. Even a little rain can’t kill the vibe.Wolf \u0026amp BadgerSince launching in 2010, Wolf \u0026amp Badger has established itself as a leading global online marketplace for independent brands. Wolf \u0026amp Badger’s Coal Drops Yard store is an exciting physical space to shop, swoon and find inspiration – boasting more than 600 independent brands with an eye for design. One of Coal Drops Yard’s largest stores (you’ll have to go all the way to New York for another outpost), this light-filled emporium has three floors of fashion, homeware, beauty and jewellery, as well as an in-store florist, a Raw Press juice bar and a restaurant, hicce – former Murano head chef Pip Lacey’s new outing – to replenish you for another trying-on session. If this is the future of department stores, we’re happy to be served.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s unique offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":null,"title":"it takes two creative duos on how collaboration makes them thrive","story":"Two heads are better than one, so the saying goes, and if these Coal Drops Yard pairings are anything to go by, there’s something in it …Creativity and collaboration are at the heart of Coal Drops Yard and its array of independent businesses, offering everything from bras to baguettes. We spoke to three of the district’s creative duos to get some tips on pairing up and the art of compromise.Lots of siblings wouldn’t be able to work together – have you guys always collaborated well?Mazie: We have entirely different skills, which I think is critical to us getting on. Abbie heads up design and I head up the marketing. We don’t step on each other’s toes and we trust each other’s judgments. She’s a bit more daring and I’m more commercial, so we’re a good balance.Abbie: The crossover in our pregnancies, with hormones raging, was pretty much the only time we had a row. One argument in three years of collaborating together on Beija isn’t bad, I reckon. Our working relationship improves all the time, as we gain confidence and toughen up.Has your relationship changed since you began working together?Mazie: It’s definitely stronger. She was my stroppy older sister before, but now she’s my best friend. I like to think we’ve both matured a lot since launching Beija.What do you each think the other brings to the brand?Abbie: Mazie brings so much – ideas, jokes, vision and commerciality. I can get a bit avant garde. She reins us all in.Mazie: Abbie brings gorgeous bras that women want to wear – simple styling and beautiful colours. She has great taste and won’t compromise on quality for price, which is what I really respect about her. She’s got high standards.What’s a day in the life of Beija like?Mazie: No day is the same – it’s a ride of amazing highs and frustrating lows. We’re still in our infancy, so I have a lot of jobs – a mix of copywriting, contacting buyers, planning newsletters, designing digital ads, social media, looking at fabrics, plus planning the future of Beija …Abbie: I reply to emails in the morning and do lab dips – approving and rejecting fabric colour submissions. Then I smash through patterns, make sure all the fabrics are there for cutting, so that the samples can be picked up and sewn. Measuring and fitting, then more emails and catching up with the factories. I meet with fabric suppliers, and then have meetings with my team at various points in the day. When I’m designing I have to get away from the office, as there’s no brain space with so much going on.Has Coal Drops Yard influenced your work?Mazie: I visit Coal Drops Yard twice a week and I never want to leave. It’s got a style about it that I really love – it’s laid-back and effortless. I’m always blown away by how cool and well-dressed everyone is.Abbie: The customers who shop here definitely influence us. They are pretty cool, understated and modern. And architecturally, yes. It’s a super slick, strong and neat space – all characteristics I admire and consider when I’m designing.What’s your working relationship like?Missy: In any successful relationship, work or otherwise, you have to put as much energy into understanding and knowing the other person as you do into the actual work. It’s complex being involved with your work partner in a romantic way, because sometimes you’re restricted by what they know already – about you, about the business and the way you work. Collaboration is as much about space as it is about closeness.Our ideas cross over the most in the creative, fun parts of the business, which is what we both enjoy most, but that’s not all the business is. There are a lot of times we just have to get our heads down and split the crappy jobs that no one wants to do!What do you each bring that’s unique?Gabriel: Bodega Rita’s is the product of two people with very different sensibilities and very different ways of working, and we are extremely lucky that these juxtapositions balance out in a beautiful way. It allows us to split responsibilities based on our inidual strengths, enabling us to encourage and support each other while getting on with what needs to be done.Missy: Gabe’s a brilliant chef but, more than that, he understands the importance of the experience of eating, and the transportive quality of flavour. He brings his references together in a way that is honest and thorough and not at all pretentious, and translates food that belongs in a restaurant into a tiny grab-and-go sandwich shop with eight seats.Has your store been influenced by its Coal Drops Yard location?Missy: The power of food is that it’s unifying, so we are absolutely influenced not only by the history of the area but the fact that it’s a workplace for some people, a day out for others, a place of study … I’m looking forward to summer when we can keep the front doors open, have music playing and create a lovely hangout spot for people visiting the area.What advice would you give to someone embarking on a creative collaboration with someone they’re in a relationship with?Gabriel: Work out your inidual strengths and respect them. Communicate and support each other. And always make time to do stuff together that has absolutely nothing to do with work – regularly. Don’t let work get in the way.How did you become business partners?Joao: We have been mates for a long time and we both share the same love and respect for the craft of tattooing and the piercing industry. Sacred Gold was the perfect opportunity to join forces and create something special.What’s a typical day in the life of Sacred Gold?Guy: Adorning lots of people from all walks of life. From mild to wild, discreet to ostentatious, we have something for everyone.What do you think each other brings to the business?Joao: Guy has a lot of experience and insight into the management and approach of running a studio, and a business awareness that benefits us greatly.Guy: Joao has a very unique style that is instantly recognisable. His tattoos are extremely hard to duplicate, creating something special and exclusive to Sacred Gold.What advice would you give someone starting a creative collaboration with a friend?Joao: I would say a successful partnership consists of friends who have opposing qualities. Guy and I have different strengths, so we can both bring something different to the table and balance each other out.Guy: Collaboration means bouncing ideas off one another and expanding on them. Seeing things from a different set of eyes can really expand an idea. A different perspective can also be refreshing and can help when an idea feels stagnant.Has Coal Drops Yard inspired your work?Joao: It’s been an influence on the interior of the studio. We wanted to reflect the way Coal Drops Yard has held on to the historical structure while adding modern elements.Guy: I think what influenced us the most was the style and high spec of Coal Drops Yard – we knew we had to do something that would do justice to such an incredible project.Looking for a more personal shopping and dining experience, or simply want to discover somewhere new in the capital?

Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/138286a34773c30bad65fcfb73aebd024b06875c/0_98_2846_1708/master/2846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0752773a9192ccf22caf2365f33c8baa","title":"master chefs 10 delicious dishes you can devour at coal drops yard","story":"London’s delicious new shopping and dining destination, Coal Drops Yard, has attracted some of the capital’s most exciting culinary talent.

The “parm” does not, as I thought for many years, refer to the inclusion of parmesan cheese.According to Sicilian Food: Recipes from Italy’s Abundant Isle, by Mary Taylor Simeti, it refers to palmigiana, which means shutters in Sicilian. One day, as someone somewhere in Sicily arranged slices of fried aubergine, corners overlapping corners, they were reminded of wooden shutters and their overlapping slats. However, as Sicilians struggle to pronounce the letter “l”, their creation became parmigiana di melanzane instead. This could of course be one of the many gastronomic tales that are passed around like Chinese whispers, but, true or not, the idea of shutters is a useful one in terms of construction, reminding us how the fried slices should be arranged.The first question with this dish is whether to fry or not to fry. Fry, fry, fry is almost always my answer, especially when it comes to aubergine slices for parmigiana. This is primarily because I like the thick, velvet-like texture and deep flavour that is created by letting slices dance around a pan of hot olive oil until light golden in colour and ever so slightly crisp.Second, when aubergine is immersed completely in hot oil (olive or vegetable), the cooking time is reduced and with it the amount of fat absorbed. Door open wide, shower cap on, I fry in a deep frying pan, heating two inches of oil until a cube of bread dances around the pan with a coat of bubbles. I fry four large aubergines sliced into 3mm rounds in batches, and, once golden, lift them on to a tray lined with plenty of kitchen paper to drain. I have discovered that this is a task that takes exactly the same amount of time as two back-to-back episodes of Desert Island Discs.For a leaner version in both spirit and flavour, the slices can be brushed with olive oil and roasted in the oven or seared on a grill pan, until soft and branded with dark lines.Whether you choose to fry, bake or grill, while the aubergine slices rest, cut 400g mozzarella into thin, scraggy slices (or simply shred it), grate 150g parmesan and tip 300ml smooth tomato sauce into a bowl. This can be your own sauce or a good-quality passata from a jar, or a tin of peeled plum tomatoes passed through a food mill and seasoned with salt and ripped basil.Now it’s all about making layers in an oven-proof dish – a 40cm x 27cm Pyrex one is ideal. Start with a layer of aubergine, the corners overlapping slightly like shutters, followed by a smear of tomato sauce, some ripped basil leaves, mozzarella and parmesan. Repeat this sequence of layers until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of aubergine. The top will need a thick carpet of grated parmesan and some breadcrumbs, too, if you like, plus a zigzag of olive oil.The resting is as important as the cooking. Once the parmigiana has been baked at 180C (160C fan)gas 4 for 30 minutes, leave to sit for at least a couple of hours and up to 12. It is the same principle here as with lasagne when served straight from the oven, it will be a soft and sloppy affair, the considerable heat blinding the flavour. Resting will not only develop the flavour, it will also allow the melted mozzarella and parmesan to settle and firm up into a coherent whole.I often make a shutter-like parmigiana in the morning for the evening, or in the evening for the next day. When it’s time to eat, I give the parmigiana another 10 minutes in the oven and a few more under the grill, until the top bubbles madly. Green salad with red-wine vinegar is a good partner for a square of this, on the same plate if you’re English (me) or on a separate one if you’re Italian.400g mozzarella4 large aubergines (approx 1 kg)Olive or vegetable oil, for frying300ml tomato sauce or passata150g parmesan, gratedBasilThe day before, put the mozzarella in a sieve over a bowl and drain for 24 hours. The next day, cut the mozzarella into thin, shaggy slices. Slice the aubergine into 3mm-thick rounds.In a small, deep frying pan, heat two inches of oil until hot and fry the aubergine slices in batches, turning, until they are golden brown on both sides. Lift onto a baking tray lined with kitchen towel to drain. If you want to bake the aubergine, brush the slices with oil, sprinkle with a little salt and lay on a baking tray. Roast at 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 for 30 minutes, or until browned and tender. To griddle, brush the aubergine slices with oil, sprinkle with a little salt and cook in a hot griddle pan until soft and branded with dark lines.In a 40cm x 27cm pyrex dish, lay a base of aubergine slices, smear over some of the tomato sauce or passata, scatter over a quarter of the mozzarella, some grated parmesan and ripped basil. Repeat the layers until you have used up all of the ingredients, ending with a layer of auberinge. Sprinkle over the last of the parmesan and zigzag with olive oil.Bake at 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 for 30 minutes, then leave to rest for at least three and up to to 12 hours. When you are ready to eat, reheat the parmigiana in a warm oven for 10 minutes, finishing under the grill until bubbling, if you wish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c15a1d416b6060e7b8f772f9cacd3b4fd14830e/0_672_3541_2125/master/3541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=376702f8610129deb29173799abda7c2","title":"thomasina miers recipe courgette mint butter bean stew","story":"Light, velvety and wonderfully garlicky, this is the perfect stew for the summerGarlic is wonderful at this time of year: sweet and succulent, with none of the bitterness of its winter counterpart.

Bring to a simmer and simmer gently for 45-55 minutes, until the beans are tender but still holding their shape, skimming the surface of any froth. (If the beans boil vigorously, their skins tend to break and they lose shape.) Take off the heat and add enough salt to make the cooking liquid taste good. Leave the beans to cool in the liquid.Slice three of the remaining garlic cloves. Warm the oil in a wide, deep pan over a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the sliced garlic and courgettes. Fry for five to seven minutes, until the courgettes begin to turn golden. Turn the heat down to medium-low, season with a little salt and cook for a further 10 minutes, until tender.Drain the beans, discarding the bay and garlic, and stir into the courgettes with the wine, lemon rind, thyme and a few tablespoons of water. Cook for five minutes, to allow the flavours to bond, then taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Take off the heat and stir in the mint.Rub the hot toast with the last garlic clove and drizzle with a little olive oil. Put in shallow bowls and spoon over the stew. Top with a large dessertspoon of goat’s curd and scatter generously with more mint leaves and an extra drizzle of olive oil to serve.Cook an extra 500g butter beans as above, blitz to a smooth puree with garlic and olive oil, and serve alongside grilled chicken thighs, roast chicken or lamb.

Both will be “tests” for the World Cup being held in the Gulf state in 2022.Explaining the decision on behalf of the Fifa council following their meeting before Wednesday’s annual congress in Paris, Victor Montagliani, the president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, said: “I think it’s a great opportunity to test the facilities. I think it hits all the marks. It will be good for Qatar to have those events over the next two years and test out their transportation, their accommodation, their stadiums. I think it’s a good exercise.”Montagliani acknowledged Fifa had made the decision to send two more of its competitions to Qatar without having discussed human rights problems in its meeting.“Not today, not in the council meeting, but those issues are part of the ongoing discussion between the special administration which deals with this on a daily basis and obviously the local organising committee,” he said.One man also died on a construction site.Tej Narayan Tharu, 23, as reported by the  in November, fell while working on the Al Wakrah stadium.

The Qataris should have independently investigated the health risks and put those protections in place.”Hassan al-Thawadi, the chairman of Qatar’s supreme committee, also speaking after the Fifa council meeting, accepted “there is still a long way to go” for the welfare of workers. “Every death is a tragedy, it’s as simple as that,” he said. “On the ones that are addressed in the report as non-work-related deaths, we have started a medical study with a local university. We have instigated on our projects annual health checks.”He referred to the Qatar government’s implementation of a recommended minimum wage of 750 rials a month – £160, just over £40 per week – and said it is due for an increase. The supreme committee has put in place a refund system for workers who have paid recruitment fees to agents in their home countries, which are now outlawed, and the government itself is working on a reform programme with the International Labour Organisation.“While progress has been made in the state of Qatar there is still a long way to go,” Thawadi said. “We are working very hard with NGOs, medical institutions, trade unions, universities, to do everything we can to address these issues.”Thawadi said he welcomed the opportunity for Qatar to host the Club World Cups, describing it as “exciting times,” and a chance to rehearse their operations and stadium plans before the 2022 World Cup, now confirmed to be 32 teams.Qatar does not have alcohol freely available, but Thawadi said opportunities for supporters to drink in designated are incorporated into their plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf1702181665aea957dbf03cfe13b313b18441b/0_311_9449_5670/master/9449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d99c21269ded6482c2ccefbe99f1b26","title":"louis van gaal manchester united  interview buy players rooney tactics solskjaer","story":"United’s former manager on Rooney, tactics, why the club is too commercial and being ‘very surprised’ at Solskjær’s appointment sat down with Louis van Gaal at Noordwijk’s Grand Hotel Huis ter Duin, three years since his dismissal by Manchester United.Jamie Jackson: Did you feel betrayed because Manchester United wanted you to do three years and then one day after you won the FA Cup final they turned around and said goodbye?How was your relationship with José Mourinho? There’s no hard feelings with Mourinho?What is the problem at Manchester United now?The problem begins with, of course, that Manchester United was never refreshed. I think when you are a manager you have to refresh every year to keep the team-building process going.You brought in players. You tried to refresh.Did they not take your advice?I thought always Manchester United can buy every player because they have a lot of power. Seemingly a few players were not reachable for Manchester United. I cannot understand but it was like that.Ángel Di María, was he your choice?Di María was my choice at AZ, seven years before.He didn’t sign then. Did you want him for United? Were you happy that he came?I was satisfied, because he was a creative player, but I had other players on the list. Di María had a problem with the English football culture and the climate. You cannot buy players and know, for sure, that they can deliver. You cannot know because football is a team sport.Where did he want to play?I always ask a player where he wants to play. For him it was wing, wide and mostly left. In the Argentina team he plays on the left. I started with him there. He was not performing that well, to a level you could expect from an £80m player. I believe, then, I have to see if another position is better for him. I have played him left winger, as the 10, second striker and on the right. Then the critics say he is having to play in too many positions. I gave him all the chances that there were to perform well.Do you have any regrets about your time with Manchester United?No. The way they sacked me was terrible. But I like my time in England, because of the culture, because of the people. A lot of humour and always supporting the manager. I have respect for everybody I worked with.Who was the best player you had there?You haven’t mentioned Wayne Rooney. Was he too old by then? I’m sorry but he was over the hill. But in spite of that he was one of my best players.Was it difficult to make Rooney captain? Was he really the only choice?You can say nothing about his professionalism as a player in the training sessions or on a pitch. Outside the environment of the training pitch and the stadium is different. I made him my captain because I want to control that life outside.Interesting. Give him responsibility and then he …I think we don’t succeed totally.You said you don’t understand why United have a lot of money and won’t always pay for players. Is that because the Glazers didn’t want to pay?What does it take to be a perfect technical director or director of football?First of all you need knowledge of the game, methods of training, preparation experience, youth education, scouting and you have to think in structures. So you need a lot of experience in the football world. When you are in your profession as a technical director, you have developed a name, then you have a big network and you can always make use of that network.One person United are interested in to become technical director is Rio Ferdinand. What do you think about this? He was a good player, obviously.Were you surprised that Solskjær was given the job permanently?I was very surprised he got it in spite of the winning run at the start.Because Manchester United is one of the biggest clubs in the world that needs a manager with experience and not a manager who has trained at one or two teams and on a lower level.Pep Guardiola went straight into Barcelona after managing the Barcelona B team. He was very successful.There are always exceptions and he played as a central midfielder at the highest level, a position where you need tactical orientation, and he was my captain!You’ve got a philosophy of playing football: your Ajax team, Barcelona, AZ and Bayern Munich. Do United have one, would you say? When I was accepting the job, we never spoke about the system Manchester United played with, or about a philosophy.Is that a surprise?All my teams are really teams. I think also United played like a team. When your head is already cut off and you can inspire the players still to play that football or play the style that you want to play … We always played the same system but with other accents, depending on the opponent.If you had a blank canvas, how long would it take to sort United out? The trouble is that you cannot demand so much time. And the fans do not allow that. Also with Solskjær, they shall demand in spite of him being an ex-player. In the football world you have to deliver. However as an ex-player you always have more credit.Is it almost impossible then to succeed at these big clubs, at United? I remember your first press conference, you basically said ‘it’s too much commercial, this club’.I’m happy that you remember that. I think you have to change the structure in the organisation of Manchester United because now I think the balance between the football department and commercial department is not right and even slopes over to the commercial.What do you mean by that?What I have experienced is that I must go to the USA before the season and we have to play a lot of matches in a short time. That is a good commercial preparation but not the best for me as a football manager. Everybody was happy except me, because in the USA we won everything, but the first match in the league was a loss: Swansea. That is because every player was exhausted. When you have to start like that, that’s not good.In scouting players, Manchester United don’t have the organisation to deliver the best players in my opinion. Then with the education of players, you cannot say that the education of Manchester United is very good. How many players are coming through?With Manchester United, you have a fantastic performance department and that is under the guidance of the doctor. But this performance department needs also the guidance of an experienced technical director. You have to use that department not only for the first team but also intensively for the youth education. Then young players are more educated in the philosophy of Man United and the big step to the first team is much easier. These are the important aspects that you have to develop as a technical director.How do you provoke space?Because Salah, Firmino and Mané need a bigger space than Agüero, Sané and Sterling and also the creativity in City’s midfield is higher with De Bruyne, David Silva, Fernandinho and Bernardo Silva – they can play in a small space. That’s why City are the champions.Can you tell me the favourite player you’ve managed? Not the best but someone you really enjoyed working with.And your best memory from your career?The most exciting moment in football was not on the bench. It was on the canals of Amsterdam. The Champions League win. That was fantastic. More than a million people along the canals, old people from the windows. Fantastic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a556d9bbe5898b721d307ecb60a505d1c42a00c3/0_215_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd43a6cc9a1d7a32c26c9859fc46648","title":"ronald koeman interview netherlands england nations league","story":"Deep in the countryside at the Dutch FA’s sparkling, almost-new training centre, Ronald Koeman is sitting in a mocked-up dressing room surrounded by orange shirts. For the man tasked with restoring a proud football nation’s lustre after several years in the doldrums, the pressures of international management seem a world away on a warm afternoon at the £12m facility in Zeist where even the hand dryers in the toilets match the colour scheme.“Every Monday and Tuesday I am here to do interviews, planning or analysing our opponents and the rest of the week I travel to see players and games,” he says. “Once a week I can play golf! I became a grandfather two weeks ago and I will be again after the Nations League with our daughter. It’s different but I like it.”Now 56 and a veteran of nearly two decades in the dugout, Koeman also has plenty of professional reasons for feeling positive about life. The Netherlands side who will face England on Thursday in the Nations League semi-finals came through a qualifying group including world champions France and arch-rivals Germany – some achievement for a country which has not qualified for a major tournament since the 2014 World Cup. But it has been the emergence of several key players in the vibrant Ajax team who came within seconds of reaching the Champions League final which has really set pulses racing in the home of Johan Cruyff and Total Football.“In the last few years, yes, it is the best generation,” says their manager, hardly able to suppress his excitement. “But they are just starting. They have great talents. Frenkie de Jong has signed for Barcelona. Maybe Matthijs de Ligt will sign also for … He will also sign for a big club, nobody knows at the moment which one. Donny van de Beek has had a great improvement this season and that is good.“We always brought good young players through the system from what we have in Holland. Maybe we have four or five really good young players. The under-17s of Holland have won the European Championship. But they are 17. We maybe have to wait two or three years and if everything is going well, we will see to bring them to the national team. But we are a country that will always produce good young players. Always.”Koeman also knows he is fortunate that, unlike at Ajax, where he played for three seasons before controversially joining rivals PSV Eindhoven and winning the European Cup for the first time in 1988, the new golden generation of Dutch football can be kept together on the international stage for several years.“Sometimes in football it’s like this: talented young players coming through the system. The atmosphere around the national team changed and that was down to the players and how we started in the Nations League. We won a tough group with France and Germany and OK … Finally we had a good start in the qualifying – the Germany game was nice in one way even if we were disappointed at the final whistle. But we are on a good way back to where we would like to stay as a country.”The thrilling 3-2 defeat by Germany at the end of March in which Koeman’s side battled back from 2-0 down only to concede a last-minute goal was his third defeat in 12 matches since succeeding Danny Blind in February 2018. Gareth Southgate inflicted the first, on Koeman’s debut, although the player responsible for one of the most infamous incidents in England’s history is hoping for a similar outcome to the events of October 1993 when the teams meet in Guimarães.“Oh no, no, no. It is too long ago. They have asked me several times,” Koeman says of the 2-0 World Cup qualifying victory in which he scored the first goal from a free-kick having somehow stayed on after his foul on David Platt. “OK, it was a big mistake of the referee – and I am not the referee! He gave the decision. He gave me a yellow instead of a red card. Maybe if there had been VAR …”His focus is clearly on the present and even with the PFA player of the year, Virgil van Dijk, and Georginio Wijnaldum likely to be feeling the effects of a long season, Koeman admits the preparation has been tougher for Southgate.Koeman, a talented, ball-playing defender in the mould of Ruud Krol, was part of the side who won the European Championship in 1988 before joining Cruyff’s Barcelona “Dream Team” the following year. His goal against Sampdoria at Wembley secured Barça’s first European Cup in 1992 – the most important of nearly 250 for club and country. Yet unlike De Ligt and Van Dijk, who will represent a formidable barrier to England’s attack, Koeman says he never really enjoyed the art of defending.After retiring from playing in 1997, Koeman went to the World Cup the following year as part of Guus Hiddink’s coaching staff and worked as Louis van Gaal’s assistant at Barça before taking his first senior post. Those experiences provided a solid base for a managerial career that has taken him to Portugal, Spain and two assignments in the Premier League at Southampton and Everton, although you sense it could be a while until we see him back in club management.“If you are working outside your country then your family, your kids … you lose also different things, because you work as a manager in the Premier League without stopping, seven days a week,” Koeman says. “And what happened of course in the last few months at Everton was difficult so it was good to go back and start this job.“I am proud that I became national coach of Holland and even for the players it’s the same. You are defending the colours of your country. Do everything to put Holland back in the big tournaments, because then you get the support of the fans and that’s really important. We start like that and that makes it now that we are on the way back. We are still not there where we want but we need time for that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843457421f7d520fc7afc0189b70ec627644fd1a/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a41b18279de7d485c3a526fe784f95","title":"womens world cup 2019 hopes expectations","story":"The most anticipated Women’s World Cup in history is just days away.

As if delivering instructions in an undercover military operation, her tight jaw relinquishing to a rallying cry, Carrie Brownstein commands this love song for the unlovable, keen to impress upon a partner the urgency and disembodying exhilaration of becoming open to love, the domestic and existential overhaul of it. “You got me used to loving you!” she spits, half-indignant, half-enrapt at the surprise of it. It is the first song from the Pacific Northwest trio’s forthcoming ninth album, produced by St Vincent, whose fantastic way with aggression and absurdism makes itself heard in the lurching vocal cries of Corin Tucker that colour Hurry on Home’s pop-industrial churn.Houston’s hottest sets out her philosophy on the first track from debut album Fever: men are good for nothing but money and head, though cash is best made oneself, the fewer details given the better, and critics can go whistle (in so many words). Her punishing flow is proof of an impending supremacy, a thrillingly vicious counterpoint to her hometown’s screwed legacy and rap’s post-SoundCloud slurring.“Everyone deserves a past they don’t care to mention!” Bill Callahan declared on America, from his 2011 album Apocalypse. But on The Ballad of the Hulk – one of six songs released to trail new album Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest – he is “talking about the old days”. He muses, in that beguiling, quizzical baritone, on whether permitting himself more angry outbursts in his younger years might have saved him “holding on to ancient aches” that a reiki master intuits in his body. “I try to be a good person,” he pledges, then wonders if that’s worth pursuing at all when “the risk of the road” might derail those efforts. But the peace of Callahan’s new material – the loosest acoustic guitar playing, as bright and cleansing as dawn, inflected with humour and subtle drama – makes the case for trying. It is a fool’s errand to look to musicians for guidance, but Callahan feels attuned to a sense of calm and certainty worth heeding.JXF is a North Carolina-based folklorist and guitar player who specialises in making old songs glow with new wonder. On Out of Sight, his forthcoming record on Paradise of Bachelors, he is joined by a band for the first time, dwelling on material about “the troubles and delights of love, work and wine”. Oh Captain’s narrator is dissatisfied with his workaday grind, but Fussell and co make bright, dewy work from guitar, fiddle, piano and pedal steel.Wayfaring Stranger is one of the great mythic songs of America: dating back to the early 19th century, its stirring melody is always searching for resolution, much like the itinerant figure of its title. The definitive versions are perhaps by Johnny Cash and Emmylou Harris, but everyone from Ed Sheeran to Jack White and Eva Cassidy have had a go at it (and there’s a brilliant dark UK garage version by Jamie Woon remixed by Burial). Rhiannon Giddens’ take, from her second brilliant album of the year after her collaborative Our Native Daughters project, is stirring: her soaring voice giving the old song a new clarity and certainty.The permanently dapper Blood-affiliated rapper released his new album 4REAL4REAL this month, and it’s an absolute triumph: a true West Coast classic reminiscent of Tupac’s complex, propulsive passion. There’s blistering gangsta rap (Stop Snitchin), classy R\u0026ampB (Keisha Had a Baby) and a tremendously impassioned speech paying tribute to the late Nipsey Hussle. But the high point is Do Not Disturb – over a simple piano motif, YG’s verse is quick and dextrous, and Kamaiyah’s chorus is as withering as it is catchy. G-Eazy meanwhile uses the en vogue off-beat flow coined by fellow west coaster Blueface purists might hate it but the breezy style matches his casual cattiness: “She got a 21 waist, she models VS  Her diet is sniff more, eat less.”This is the best thing that Jarvis Cocker has done since the dissolution of Pulp: a psych-pop epic packed with humour and anthemic energy. Over a peppy rhythm, organs and Morricone-style vintage production, Cocker – under his new guise of Jarv Is… – sings a song of reluctant personal development. Or rather speaks it: in the storied style of talky Cocker songs like I Spy and David’s Last Summer, this features some wonderfully droll fantasies (“I walked through a tunnel backwards through time  Dragging my knuckles, listening to Frankie Knuckles”) as it bustles towards a spectacular climax.There’s a point at which rap technique becomes so refined and skilful that it almost morphs into a kind of sport: a prowess to be cheered and marvelled at as you would a particularly neat rabona. The verses on this track, traded between two of the UK’s most exciting up-and-coming MCs will have you hooting with satisfaction at the tongue-twisting skill the production from Scratcha DVA is the perfect springboard.Eternal Forward Motion, the third album from the Woking quintet, has been met with raptures in Britain’s metal community, and for good reason. It is a supremely focused, bracingly angry record, with space for some startling innovations amid the violent downforce, like the minimalist drums’n’screaming intro to Harsh Truth. Vocalist Justine Jones pours everything into her excoriations of toxic relationships and social pressures, including on this title track that sets up a thrilling dissonance: is she finding comfort in how time marches on regardless, or is she being steamrolled by it? Either way, the cacophonously strident climax is a weirdly moving moshpit moment.Murda Beatz, the man on the boards for beautiful productions like 6ix9ine’s Fefe, Travis Scott’s Butterfly Effect and Drake’s Portland and Nice for What, crafts one of his prettiest confections for the latest and best in a string of Chance singles. Chance’s verses are great: naive playground melodies used to chart how far he’s come, from “kitchen drawers full of sporks” to a five-star hotel where “fancy carpet make her feel like Jasmine”. But he gets upstaged somewhat by goofy Texan MC TisaKorean, whose pronunciation of “crow” is life-givingly silly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76637065d293b8d7d09e2637a839ec6806347c8f/113_0_3273_1964/master/3273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8256f5635fe507cbefe47c689fd127e","title":"inside islamic state umm sayyaf podcast","story":"Martin Chulov, the ’s Middle East correspondent, tells Anushka Asthana about meeting Umm Sayyaf, who described her role in helping the CIA hunt for the Isis leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Concerns were also raised about alleged behaviour towards two students, as reported by the Sunday Times at the time.He has strenuously denied the allegations, no formal complaint was pursued and Prescott returned to his role in the Labour leader’s office.Leaked emails suggested Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, told senior Labour officials she did not believe there were grounds for suspending Prescott’s Labour membership to bar him from attending party events.On Tuesday, Labour staffers wrote an open letter to Corbyn asking him to overhaul the system.In the letter, first reported by the Times, they wrote: “Working in politics isn’t easy, and many of us choose to give up our personal lives for Labour because we believe it is the best force for good in our country. What makes the job even more challenging than it should be is having to work in an environment where sexual harassment and bullying are not taken seriously.”The letter calls the reports about Prescott “extremely concerning” and said they needed urgent clarification as to whether the account in the Sunday Times was correct.“Clarity, consistency and transparency must be put at the forefront of the complaints process so that all sides feel confident that investigations will be conducted free from political interference,” the letter went on.“The perception can no longer be that your connections within the party will determine whether complaints against you will be pursued or not. We want to see Labour in government, but we need to get our house in order first.“We should, and can, lead the way in challenging and eradicating sexual harassment and bullying in work environments. The decision to write this letter does not come easily, but believing in a political party sometimes means having to ask uncomfortable questions.”Labour has said it takes all complaints extremely seriously. “In this case, no formal complaint was received to investigate,” a party spokesman said.MPs have urged the party to make its complaints procedure entirely independent to avoid accusations of factionalism in dealing with complaints of harassment or racism and antisemitism. The MPs Jess Philips and Stella Creasy have said the party must carve off its complaints arm, rather than use the current system where the bodies making final decisions about the complaints can be elected on factional slates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e511b66526cae6e0af25513f929ad167643629/514_183_2635_1581/master/2635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4ebfe6318caf8bd5fb57cdfaacb7634","title":"esther mcvey unfit to be an mp after lgbt comments says labour","story":"Angela Rayner calls Tory leadership candidate’s views ‘illegal, immoral and dangerous’Labour has accused the Conservative leadership hopeful Esther McVey of being unfit to be an MP after she repeated her view that parents should be allowed to take primary-aged children out of lessons on same-sex relationships.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said McVey’s arguments in favour of letting parents take young children out of LGBT education were “illegal, immoral and deeply dangerous”.“Esther McVey is not fit to be a candidate for PM and not fit to be an MP,” she said. “We cannot and will not fail LGBT young people. Not only do we have a moral duty to ensure that all young people receive LGBT-inclusive education, there is a legal requirement too under the Equalities Act.”McVey first aired her views last week, drawing criticism from fellow Conservatives Justine Greening and Amber Rudd, who said the party could not pick and choose when it came to supporting equality.Following the criticism, McVey hit back, saying her position was not controversial.Asked on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme about her comments, McVey said: “These were very young children in primary schools and I said the people who should know whether it is age-relevant are the parents not the state.“I believe that parents with very young children … four- and five-year-olds, and I would say that is a young child … their parents know for their child what is age-relevant.“And by the way, this is not controversial. This is the same policy that Justine Greening oversaw. It is the same policy that Labour oversaw. For young children in this multicultural, erse, modern society that we live in, I would say for very young children – as you say, four and five – parents have the say over sex education.“But I happily agree and I welcome that LGBT rights are taught within sex education.”The issue has become topical because parent protesters have been banned from demonstrating outside the school gates against LGBT teaching at a Birmingham primary school.The local council secured an interim high court injunction banning protests from taking place within an exclusion zone around the site.The interim injunction covers the streets immediately surrounding the school and bars protesters from printing or distributing leaflets, inviting others to protest and encouraging people to congregate at the entrance. The protesters will have a chance to make their case to a judge next Monday.The order, published on the council’s website, also prohibits the use of social media to make offensive or abusive comments about staff members.The move follows weeks of protests at various schools over the adoption of a programme designed to teach children about characteristics protected by the Equality Act.

Earlier this year, the station was censured by the media regulator Ofcom for breaching broadcasting impartiality rules when Galloway cast doubt on Russian involvement in the poisoning of Yulia and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury last year.A spokesperson for the station confirmed it had taken Galloway off air following his tweet, which was posted after the game finished on Saturday night. They said: “TalkRadio has terminated George Galloway’s weekly show with immediate effect. As a fair and balanced news provider, TalkRadio does not tolerate antisemitic views.”Since Galloway’s departure from parliament in 2015 and a disastrous campaign in the 2016 mayor of London race, he has increasingly concentrated on media work.This resulted in the unusual relationship between Galloway and TalkRadio, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK. The station’s studios recently moved into the main News UK office in London Bridge, sharing a building with the Sun and the Times – outlets that Galloway has often attacked for political reasons.Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called Galloway a “poisonous and isive figure” and said her organisation welcomed the decision to take him off air. “His attempt to bring hatred into a wonderful occasion for English football has attracted the derision it deserves,” she said.The Labour deputy leader and shadow media minister, Tom Watson, said he welcomed the decision: “We must stand together against bigotry and in solidarity with the Jewish community. I welcome the decision to take a voice that thrives on ision off the air.”Galloway, a longstanding anti-EU campaigner who endorsed Nigel Farage’s Brexit party in the EU elections, appears to have no intention of going quietly. He has agreed to appear on ITV’s Good Morning Britain to discuss his suspension and responded to news of his sacking by threatening the station with legal action: “See you in court guys … Long live Palestine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999ee2f8419e749f87493a38b3177e0ff4990431/0_0_4768_2864/master/4768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29068f6e7893dc7dea5a547bc56ebb55","title":"did you solve it dogs in pursuit","story":"The solution to today’s puzzleEarlier today I set you the following puzzle:Four dogs are in four corners of a square of side length 1. Each dog starts running towards the dog immediately anti-clockwise to it. The dogs start at the same time, they all run at the same speed, and at every moment each dog is running directly towards the neighbouring dog.During the pursuit, the dogs will run in a spiral before they all meet in the centre. How far does each dog travel before the group collision?The image of the four spirals, below, helps understand why. At each moment on their paths, the dogs are at four points of a square. The direction in which a dog is headed is therefore at all times perpendicular to the direction in which the dog that it is chasing (and which is chasing it) is headed.Consider the view from one of the dogs (the chaser). It is chasing a dog (the chasee) that at every point is moving perpendicular to the line between them. In other words, there is no part of the velocity of the chasee that is taking it further away, or closer to, the chaser beyond the movement of the chaser. As far as the chasing dog is concerned, the chasee may as well be standing still. The length of the total path travelled therefore is the distance between chaser and chasee at the start, which is the side of the square.Here’s another way to think about it, suggests Steven Strogatz, author of Infinite Powers, who suggested the puzzle. Imagine a dog has a GoPro on its head. The footage of its pursuit of its neighbouring dog along the spiral path would be exactly the same, and take the same time as, the footage of the dog if all it did was run directly along the edge of the square to a stationary dog. Lovely!I also asked you what happens if the dogs were to start in the corner of a triangle, or a pentagon. In each of those cases, the dogs are not moving perpendicular to each other at any stage. For the triangle, the distance travelled is less than a side, because the dogs are getting closer faster, and for the pentagon, the dogs are getting closer slower, so the distance travelled is more than a side. To work it out exactly requires some geometry, algebra and trigonometry. We need to work out how much of the velocity is taking the chasee towards or away from the chaser. Strogatz kindly wrote out the solution here:Thanks to Steven Strogatz for suggesting today’s puzzle, and for sketching the proof. I recommend his book Infinite Powers, a New York Times bestseller, which is out in the UK on Thursday.

And it is, after all, their money.”The average person aged 35 to 44 has a total pension wealth of about £35,000, Brokenshire said.“If a couple could combine their pension wealth, both potentially using a proportion to support a deposit, this would make a huge difference to millions of lives,” he argued. “It would give people real choice, real opportunity.”But a DWP source said the idea had not been discussed with the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, or her department, and that officials had outlined their worries to No 10.The source said: “We cannot support this policy because the evidence shows it will be risky and does not help the people it intends to help. The housing market doesn’t need people to dip into their pensions to buy more houses.”A spokesman for Brokenshire said the idea was “simply about economic freedom”.“It is about giving people greater choice over their own money, and no one is forced to take part – people can use their capital in the way they want to,” the spokesman said.“The Conservative party needs to reconnect people to capitalism, and this is one of many ideas we should be exploring as the leadership race takes place.”There has been wider concern among some officials about rules allowing people to dip into their pension funds, potentially leaving them short of money in older age.Rules on dipping into pensions were loosened under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government when the then pensions minister, Steve Webb, said it was up to people to decide.“So actually, if people do get a Lamborghini, and end up on the state pension, the state is much less concerned about that, and that is their choice,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9270b865f1ad1a28592f6012a2347d9ca8eaaa78/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e68b3078cce9bdb1605642e7dbe4c48","title":"andy murray doubles queens feliciano lopez tennis","story":"Andy Murray will return to tennis in two weeks at Queen’s, and also with a partner at Wimbledon, but the three-slam champion is “very unlikely” to play singles until later in the season, according to a trusted source.Murray, whose recovery from a second hip operation in January has quickened in the past few weeks, was always likely to ease his way back into the game in doubles and has been hitting again in light workouts, most recently with Dan Evans.Murray and the Spaniard Feliciano López, old friends and career rivals, decided this week to pair up at the west London tournament, where the Scot has won a record five singles titles and the Spaniard was the 2017 champion. Evans said after losing to Fernando Verdasco in the first round of the French Open last week that Murray was hitting the ball as well as ever, although his movement was still restricted. It is known his fitness and stamina have been reaching encouraging levels, but he has yet to convince himself that he could move with confidence or of his effectiveness in singles.Sources at the tournament confirmed on Monday afternoon only hours before the closing of the lists of entrants that Murray had asked to play. The player and club have forged a long and fruitful association since he first played there after going on the Tour in 2005. He has won $1.3m in prize money at Queen’s and has contributed to several charity fundraisers.Murray said on lta.org.uk: “I am really excited to return to the match court for the first time since my surgery. Queen’s has always been a special place for me and it’s the perfect place to return. It’s where I won my first ATP match, my first title in Britain and on grass, and it’s been my most successful tournament overall. “I’m not yet ready to return to the singles court, but I’ve been pain-free for a few months now. I’ve made good progress in training and on the practice court, and this is the next step for me as I try to return to the tour.”In Murray’s penultimate doubles appearance in 2017, he partnered Evans to a win against López and his namesake and regular teammate, Marc López, in the first round at Indian Wells. Murray and Feliciano have shared laughs, also, about the Scot’s mother’s lighthearted tweets about the handsome Spaniard.If Murray does reasonably well in doubles at Queen’s, he will then prepare for a return to Wimbledon in the same discipline. However, it is almost certain that his comeback in singles will arrive later in the summer, probably in Cincinnati before the US Open, where he made his breakthrough in 2012, beating Novak Djokovic in the final.He has endured back pain for most of his career and the troubles there have spread to groin and hip in recent years. Murray risked career-ending surgery on his chronic back pain in 2013, then tried to solve his hip problem with an operation in Melbourne at the start of 2018, which proved unsuccessful.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIt was not until he explored the radical Birmingham Method of resurfacing of the hip joint that he found comfort in surgery in London after returning in serious discomfort from the 2019 Australian Open. He went through five excruciating sets against Roberto Bautista Agut there and, in a tearful press conference, admitted he was seriously considering retirement.However, his love of the game and a determination to give it one last try has driven him to this point. He turned 32 last month. His future in the game might not be long, but it could prove to be as interesting as his first 14 years as a professional, perhaps culminating with an unprecedented third gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a174c14551d0bc3e6faa1519da81f5d483af94d9/0_219_3433_2059/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e5bdc4305a63e2798612339392eb17d","title":"england pakistan cricket world cup match report","story":"So they can’t chase absolutely anything. Even after an immaculate hundred from Joe Root and a typically majestic one from Jos Buttler, England were beaten by a wonderfully tenacious Pakistan side, oblivious to the torments they experienced here against West Indies three days ago.Pakistan, reinforcing their reputation for producing tales of the unexpected, won a thrilling encounter, which had a capacity crowd captivated as England tried to pull off the highest run chase ever in World Cup history. They needed 349 for victory and fell 14 runs short. Sometimes the mistakes – and there were plenty of them – were as entertaining as the moments of magic – and there were a few of those as well.Pakistan, summoning up the spirit of 1992 after eight ODIs without a victory, held their nerve despite the threat posed by England’s finest, Buttler and Root. Their figures may not suggest this but Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz, neither of whom were in Pakistan’s original World Cup squad, combined resolutely in the final overs they were not going to allow this game to slip away. Once Buttler had been dismissed England required 61 from just over five overs and this was beyond their much-vaunted tail.England do not lose very often when Root and Buttler have hit centuries but here was an indication of how superbly Pakistan responded to their defeat against West Indies and how poorly England reacted to their straightforward victory over South Africa. The discipline England displayed in the field at the Oval against South Africa deserted them in disturbing fashion. They were edgy, impatient and occasionally ill-tempered. It was as if they had been duped by the dismal display of Pakistan on this ground last week and that they believed all the plaudits that had come their way after their first game. For a while it looked as if they expected, like all of us sagely looking on, an easy ride. When this did not come to pass they became grumpily distracted.Eoin Morgan routinely inserted his opponents despite the conditions – a brown pitch and gentle sunshine. He likes to chase runs, ignoring the peculiar tensions that come into play in a World Cup match, even in the preliminary stages. Runs on the board count for more when the match really matters.Pakistan declined to roll over conveniently this time. Against West Indies they mustered 105 all out. Here they reached that figure in the 19th over with one wicket down. All the batsmen were eager to atone for Friday’s rout. They produced a spirited, measured performance with the bat but they were assisted by the fact that England were so badly out of kilter in the field. This was reflected by a poor review against Imam-ul-Haq, fielders being all too easily riled by comments from the stands and most obviously a dropped catch by Jason Roy, who seemed out of control for most of the day. This was a skier from the bat of Mohammad Hafeez on 14, the sort that Roy would routinely catch in practice, after which the threat of Adil Rashid, who was bowling at the time, was greatly diminished. Hafeez would punish England for this error with the outstanding knock – 84 from just 62 balls – in a Pakistan innings in which all the top five fired.England were grateful for 10 overs of controlled off-spin from Moeen Ali, who took the first three wickets to fall via an alert stumping by Buttler and two excellent catches in the deep by Chris Woakes, who would finish with four in total, a record for an English outfielder in ODI cricket. Mark Wood also impressed on his return to the side, generating good pace, two wickets and managing to retain a modicum of control in the final overs. But on this occasion, on this pitch, the bowlers needed more than the scanty support that they received in the field there were misfields, overthrows and some understandable scowls – even from the new boy Jofra Archer – as runs were donated as freely as election promises.Soon the anxieties England displayed in the field were mirrored at the crease. Roy tried an ill-judged sweep against Shadab Khan and was given lbw this misjudgment was compounded by another, with Jonny Bairstow an accomplice, the openers misguidedly deciding to review even though the ball was shown to be bang on target.Bairstow only flickered before nibbling at Wahab and Morgan, having been pinned down for three balls by Hafeez, was bowled by a quicker delivery, while Ben Stokes was caught behind off the other veteran off-spinner, Shoaib Malik. From 118 for four the bankers, Root and Buttler, gave England hope. Both played predictably to their strengths. Root composed, getting off strike with ease, Buttler delivering enough powerful strikes to keep the required run-rate in the right vicinity as they added 130 together. Both departed immediately after reaching three figures, in each case caught at short third man.The target of 58 from the last five overs with four wickets remaining was too much against Wahab and Amir despite the scurrying of Woakes and Moeen. So Pakistan deservedly prevailed to reignite their campaign. Meanwhile England’s out-cricket had been slapdash and their confidence that they can chase anything at their beloved Trent Bridge flawed.Despite the heroics of Root and Buttler they did not deserve to win, which created the oddity of the first two centurions of the tournament ending up on the losing side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f0f102717b35923d93161a884d6c035a177f69d/159_0_3695_2218/master/3695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68afbb941d18360f4d329897b224e8de","title":"johanna konta coach french open persuasion","story":"Dimitri Zavialoff and the British No 1 have thrived mutually since getting together in OctoberThere is probably more job security in bomb disposal than there is in coaching tennis players but Dimitri Zavialoff, Johanna Konta’s third mentor in two years, is sanguine about his employment situation.The British No 1, who plays Sloane Stephens in the quarter-finals here on Tuesday, plainly trusts Zavialoff and they have thrived mutually since getting together in October.Zavialoff, who talks as softly as a spy before bedtime, has helped Konta rise from 45 in the world to 26 at the start of this fortnight. After reaching two clay-court finals this season – and beating Stephens in the second round in Rome – as well as four excellent wins at Roland Garros (the red-dirt hell-hole on which she fell four times in a row at the first time of asking), she is two matches away from playing in her first grand-slam final. She has reached two slam semis, in Melbourne in 2016 and at Wimbledon a year later.But her career, like that of many players, is littered with false starts and new beginnings. Zavialoff is her fifth coach in five years, after Esteban Carril, José Manuel García, Wim Fissette and Michael Joyce. Did he wonder sometimes about how long he and Konta would be working together?He smiles and says quietly: “It’s like human relationships in general. They are sometimes short, sometimes for life – so what can I say besides that? It’s a work relationship and … I can’t say more.”Like his boss, Zavialoff says he lives “only for the present”. It is a mindset that grips the sport. They play it point by point, rally by rally, shot by shot. And while he tiptoes around the hard questions about their fledgling partnership, he is sure Konta is made of championship-winning material.“She was always a good player and that’s what I keep telling her,” he says. As for her remarkable rehabilitation on clay, he says: “I knew something would happen since I started working with her. Whether it will happen on clay or after I didn’t know but I was kind of waiting for it to happen – and it did happen on clay.”As for her “No Plan B” mindset, it seems Zavialoff may have persuaded Konta to be more flexible – which she has described as “malleable” in recent statements.Zavialoff, a self-confessed “not very good” player when young, has lived in France for 20 years. His father was from a Russian family that moved to Switzerland and he has retained a close connection with Swiss tennis. He worked with Stan Wawrinka for 17 years, guiding him into the top 10, and spent five years with the former top-tenner Timea Bacsinszky, who described the collaboration before they split last year as “absolutely great”.Konta and Wawrinka also share a British agent, Lawrence Frankopan – and her friend-on-Tour, Donna Vecic, whom she beat to reach the quarter-finals, was Wawrinka’s partner until recently. Dimitri’s brother, Grigori, once managed Wawrinka. This is how tennis often works: a web of friends and trusted allies.Konta takes comfort that she has a winning record against the remaining seeds: Stephens, Madison Keys, Ashleigh Barty, who meet on the other side of the draw, the defending champion, Simona Halep, who demolished the teenage prodigy Iga Swiatek 6-1, 6-0 on Monday, and Petra Martic, who plays the other starlet left in the fight, Marketa Vondrousova, on Tuesday.Does Zavialoff think Konta can win the French Open? “I can’t tell a player or promise a player that she will win a grand slam. What I know is that she will be tough to beat. So, if anyone from the other players manages to do that … good for them. And if not? Then …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a174c14551d0bc3e6faa1519da81f5d483af94d9/0_206_3433_2059/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb39dea77e5a8508ee4cc55c3ec7cdb","title":"england pakistan cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"An irresistible Pakistan to beat England in a classic match at Trent Bridge despite centuries from Joe Root and Jos ButtlerOur match report has landed, so I’m off to shake my head with wonder at the Pakistan cricket team. Thanks for your company and emails. Don’t worry about England - they’ll be fine. Probably. Today, however, is not about them it’s about the most exhilarating team in the history of sport. Pakistan Zindabad!Read Ali Martin on Chris Woakes’s day:You have to love Wahab Riaz Mohammad Hafeez’s Man of the Match award was understandable, but nobody embodied Pakistan’s blistering performance better than Wahab, a cornered tiger in human form. He had a hand in five of the nine England wickets to fall, and it would have been more had he been given a first slip. He was emotional with the new ball and clinical with the old, holding his nerve to take two match-winning wickets in the 48th over.We shouldn’t get carried away with England’s defeat. They lost a superb game to an inspired Pakistan, which can happen to anyone. Their fielding was poor, but that was surely just a bad day. The thing that is worrying me is the form of Adil Rashid, who seems to be struggling with his shoulder injury. I’m not sure England can win the World Cup unless he is close to his best.Here’s Sarfaraz Ahmed “It was a great team effort. The way Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman played was so important and gave us the chance to score 350. We tried a couple of different things today – we started with Shadab because we know Roy and Bairstow are not good batsmen against spin. We were playing good cricket but we couldn’t cross the line inshallah we shall do well in later matches.” Here’s Eoin Morgan “A very good game of cricket, but extremely disappointing that we’re on the losing end, particularly when it’s so tight. Trent Bridge is a very high-scoring ground and we felt 350 was without our grasp. Losing early wickets was not ideal, but Joe and Jos kept us in the game for a long time.“I thought we were outfielded today, and that was probably the difference between the sides. It was way below par and probably cost us 15-20 runs. Pakistan bowled well and deserved to win the difference was probably the fielding, like I said. I don’t think it’s a blip – all round today we weren’t that bad. I don’t think any sides will go unbeaten and it’s going to be an extremely competitive tournament.”He’s not happy. For a split second, no more than that, he had a look in his eye that was pure Roy Keane. It turned out something brilliant was happening. Pakistan, the gift that keeps on bloody beating us. 5th over: England 28-1 (Bairstow 14, Root 5) Shadab beats Bairstow with a delicious legspinner Bairstow responds two balls later with a brusque clout down the ground for six. That was a lovely bit of ebb and flow, and Bairstow did such damage to the ball that it needs to be changed.Here’s the updated World Cup table. England’s next game is against Bangladesh in Cardiff on Saturday Pakistan play Sri Lanka at Bristol on Friday.The Man of the Match is Mohammad Hafeez“Everyone believed we could win – we were playing good cricket but not winning the crucial phases of the game. We practised very well yesterday and had a good meeting. The first game wasn’t good but we all know the capability we have. It’s like a home game for us thank you to everyone who came to support us. This will will boost our confidence, and it’s a very happy dressing-room.” Eoin Morgan is fighting so hard to retain his mask of equilibrium, but I think it’s possible to detect a flicker of shock on his face.I don’t know where to start with that. There were so many facets to a exhilarating match, including two marvellous and futile hundreds from Joe Root and Jos Buttler, but the most important was that Pakistan entered a state of haal. When they do that they are fiendishly difficult to stop. They came into this game having lost 11 consecutive ODIs. England had won 15 of their last 16 completed ODIs at home ODIs. They hadn’t lost at home when chasing for four years. So Pakistan beat them of course they did.50th over: England 334-9 (Rashid 3, Wood 10) Pakistan have beaten the hosts in a classic match!49.4 overs: England 329-9 (Rashid 2, Wood 6) England need 20 from two balls. They’re good...49th over: England 324-9 (Rashid 2, Wood 1) England need 25 from Wahab’s final over. No.Pakistan are one wicket away! Archer slices Amir high to third man, where Wahab charges in and takes a fine low catch.48.3 overs: England 322-8 (Archer 1, Rashid 1) Rashid squirts a single. Pakistan have been sensational today.48.2 overs: England 321-8 (Archer 1, Rashid 0) A dot ball from Amir to Rashid. England are done. Pakistan are Pakistan, and I’ll love them forever.48.1 overs: England 321-8 (Archer 1, Rashid 0) Amir is driven for a single by Archer. England need 28 from 11.Woakes flashed at a blistering short ball and could only top edge it to Sarfaraz, who took an easy catch. Pakistan are on the brink of a famous victory.Two in two balls for Wahab!Wahab goes around the wicket to Woakes, who drives him sweetly over long off for six! That’s an absurdly good stroke, and it prompts Wahab to go back over the wicket for the remainder of the over. A single brings Moeen on strike - and he is put out of his misery when he miscues a slower ball high in the air to point. He made 19 from 20 balls England need 29 from 13 balls.England need 38 from 18 balls.47th over: England 311-6 (Ali 19, Woakes 12) Woakes gets a precious boundary, only the third since the 38th over, with a thick edge. Amir then bowls consecutive wides – the second looked a bit harsh – before Moeen pulls the last ball for four to make it 15 from the over! 46th over: England 296-6 (Ali 15, Woakes 4) Moeen misses consecutive swipes at slower balls from Hassan Ali, whose last over costs only five runs. Moeen, in horrible touch, is in danger of playing a match-losing innings: he has 15 from 18 balls. England need 53 from four overs. It’s not going to happen.45th over: England 291-6 (Ali 12, Woakes 2) Never mind his bowling England could do with Liam Plunkett’s batting. They need sixes, urgently. They’ve only hit two fours, never mind a six, in the last seven overs. Meanwhile, this is a good spot from Tim de Lisle: Billy Root has gone a hundred better than his brother. That, surely, is the match for Pakistan. Buttler chased a beautiful slower ball and sliced it straight to short third man. It was a glorious performance from Buttler, a genius at work, but that will be provide precisely no consolation if England lose.He lashes Amir over mid-off for four to reach a magnificent 75-ball century. England need 61 from 34.44th over: England 284-5 (Buttler 99, Ali 11) Buttler inside edges Hassan’s slower ball this far wide of off stump. That was brilliantly bowled. Moeen drives just short of the man at extra cover, with the ball hurrying away for three. It would have been four but for a fine bit of fielding from Wahab Riaz. A single off the last ball of the over takes Buttler to 99. The tension is exquisite.43rd over: England 274-5 (Buttler 93, Ali 7) Even with the required rate above 10, England are happy to see Shadab out of the attack. His final over goes for six, and he finishes a fine afternoon’s work with figures of 10-0-63-2. “How would you rate your drum and bass heart throbbing?” says Ian Copestake. “Is it more Voodoo People than Deadly Deep Subs, or are we talking Brown Paper Bag?”42nd over: England 268-5 (Buttler 89, Ali 5) After another precious, boundaryless over from Hassan Ali, the required rate creeps above ten an over for the first time.Here’s Brian Withington. “Moeen Ali just needs to remember three things: rotation, rotation, rotation.”41st over: England 263-5 (Buttler 85, Ali 4) Moeen is dropped by Sarfaraz! It was a stumping chance as well, but Sarfaraz was unsighted when Moeen edged a lovely googly from Shadab, and the ball bounced off him before he could react. It’s a superb over from Shadab nonetheless - just five singles from it. This is brilliant.40th over: England 258-5 (Buttler 82, Ali 2) Moeen Ali can be a devastating six-hitter, although we haven’t seen it much of late. He hit eight sixes in 14 balls at Bristol against West Indies in 2017 since then he has hit nine sixes in 21 months. He gets going here with a couple of singles off Wahab, while Buttler drives another boundary to make it a decent over for England. They need 91 from 60 balls.“Forgive my touting ‘the other’, but I’ve been following the live win probability on england pakistan scorecard and it’s been up and down like a see-saw,” says Bill Hargreaves. “Whomever wins will be hugely strengthened in the morale department, I’d say.”Yes, the winner will get two points and a visit from Maurice Mentum. I think Pakistan are slight favourites again after that wicket.39th over: England 248-5 (Buttler 75, Ali 0) Moeen Ali is the new batsman. He is, since you asked, in abysmal form with the bat.“The West Indies-Australia match is the next at this ground, but I recall seeing on the highlights that Chris Gayle was really feeling pain in his back during his last innings,” says John Starbuck. “How is the old chap, do you know?”Goddim! Another twist in this brilliant contest. Root jabs a quicker ball from Shadab straight to short third man, where Hafeez takes a comfortable catch. Root is disconsolate as he walks slowly off the field.38th over: England 246-4 (Root 105, Buttler 75) Root celebrates his second century with a glorious back-foot drive through point for four. Another good over for England - 1o from it. Stop me if you think, etc, but this is just a wonderful match. England need 103 from 72 balls.Root pushes the new bowler Wahab for a single to reach a superb century, the first of this World Cup. It’s his 15th in ODIs, extending his own England record, and has come from 97 balls. He was frantic and lucky for the first few overs since then he has played with the utmost authority.37th over: England 236-4 (Root 99, Buttler 71) Whatever happens, this has been such an impressive partnership because it looked like Pakistan’s bowlers were going to overwhelm England and perhaps win by a huge margin. Root thumps Amir to deep cover for a single to move within one of the tournament’s first century. Five from the over. “Have you had the GB Men’s 4x100m relay team?” says George Davidson. “World champions in 2017 and drop the baton at the World relays in 2019. They are either ‘six or bust’ as the old cricketing expression goes.”36th over: England 231-4 (Root 97, Buttler 69) Root moves to 97 with a superbly placed pull to the long leg boundary off Hassan Ali. England scampered six from the other five deliveries, so that’s another excellent over. They need 118 from 84 balls.“Hasan Ali has a single ‘s’ in his first name,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “if you don’t mind me pointing that out.”I don’t mind at all – but he has two on the back of his shirt (and on his Twitter). I think he changed it quite recently, as did Sarfaraz. 35th over: England 221-4 (Root 91, Buttler 66) Mohammad Amir replaces Wahab. Buttler punches a masterful drive behind square for four and panels the next ball over mid-off for another boundary. That brings up a stirring and frequently brilliant hundred partnership from only 79 balls.“Here’s my question for you,” begins David. “What’s more satisfyingexciting for a viewer? Chasing a target to win, especially if it’s crazy like 35 off last three overs, or defending a target, especially if you’re dead and buried, like they only need 10 off two overs?”I’d say the former is more satisfying and exciting, even though it feels like the latter is a greater achievement.34th over: England 211-4 (Root 90, Buttler 57) This is the calm before the final storm. Root and Buttler take four singles and a two from Hassan’s sixth over, which makes it 12 from the last three overs. Root is ten away from becoming the first England batsman to score a World Cup century since ... Joe Root, against Sri Lanka in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7684fed69e93eb40634447f52988d152df27faad/0_183_4924_2954/master/4924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a209940006ad9bec84ea115d5a65f08","title":"french open 2019 djokovic halep zverev barty keys live","story":"Khachanov wants to get this done asap, and works poor Delpo all over the court in an 18-shot rally at deuce – then finishes with a drop shot, and implores the crowd to make some noise. The jig almost up for Del Potro, but he digs deep to keep the match alive. Khachanov leads 4-2.Khachanov keeps on track with a hold to love, sealed with a ferocious cross-courter that Delpo can only dump into the net. He leads 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 4-1 and is two games from his first grand slam quarter-final.Woof! Khachanov is like lightning around the court, prevailing in a terrific rally and leaving Del Potro slumped face down in a flower bed like Wile E Coyote. Pure theatre from the big man tonight, but he can’t get into his opponent’s head. After a lengthy, somewhat scrappy tussle, he sees off two break points to keep hope alive.Del Potro confronts the second courtside buffoon to shout out mid-point during the game, giving him a brisk talking-to that ends with a firm handshake. Textbook.It’s absolutely in Khachanov’s best interests to get this one finished tonight. He doesn’t need any more time on court, with Dominic Thiem up next if he can get through. With that in mind, he holds serve with minimum fuss, and is suddenly three games away.Khachanov breaks in the second game! A test for the Russian now – he’s been motoring along at a decent level, with the match dictated by the fall and rise of Del Potro’s form. Now he needs to be aggressive again, in a stadium packed with Argentinian fans.He digs out a useful hold, then gets 30-0 up on Del Potro’s serve – and his opponent buckles with a double fault. A return winner seals the break, and he’s back on top, 7-5, 6-3, 3-6, 2-0.Del Potro gets some eye drops from his trainer – not sure what’s been bothering him, hayfever perhaps. But I’m very much not a doctor. It’s nearly 9pm in Paris, so probably time for one more set.The order of play is out for tomorrow – three cheers for whoever decided to put the two most eye-catching matches on at the same time.Khachanov makes his opponent serve it out, then rips a backhand winner down the line to level the game at 30-all. Del Potro serves up an ill-advised drop shot, and the Russian has a break point – but nets another backhand attempt. Two huge first serves get the job done for Del Potro! He’s pulled a set back, and wallops himself in the end with his racket to celebrate.Can the Russian bounce straight back again? Del Potro looks a different prospect now, lashing the ball to all corners – and then double faulting to surrender a break point. What a weird performance. Delpo saves two points with ferocious forehands, and closes out with an ace. Could be a big moment – he’s two sets down, but 5-2 up in the third.Famous last words, as Khachanov’s first serve fails him and he slips 30-0 behind. He aims for Del Potro’s suspect backhand – and he nails an unstoppable winner! Three break points, the first taken as Khachanov’s shot down the line drifts wide. He’s back ahead in the third set!Del Potro, who would of course be the lovable wingman that stays comfortably single throughout, holds to move 3-2 up. There’s little to show he can really rattle Khachanov, who looks much the stronger from the baseline so far.Khachanov’s get-up has the look of someone sent in to shake up the villa, two weeks into Love Island. He’s grafting here, taken to deuce by Del Potro but dominating the next two rallies to hold.Oh, Juan Martín. After an unexpected break that looked to have revived that match, he tumbles to 15-40 straight away. Khachanov dominates the rally, keeping the ball well away from Del Potro’s forehand to break straight back!Here’s Kevin Mitchell on Johanna Konta’s preparations for the quarter-finals. The British No 1 takes on Sloane Stephens early doors tomorrow.Frustration boils over for Del Potro as Khachanov wins the match’s longest rally with a ferocious forehand winner. Muttering away to himself, he swiftly falls 40-15 down – but rallies to deuce as his opponent takes his eye off the ball. Khachanov then overcooks a groundstroke, and it’s break point! The Russian stays in the rally, and Delpo thinks he’s missed a smash – but it catches the line. He’s back in this, 2-0 up in the third!After a routine hold each, Khachanov serves for the second set. He hasn’t given Del Potro a look in on first serve in this set. The No 10 seed quickly brings up three set points, and takes the first as his opponent goes long. It’s a long way back for Del Potro now.Khachanov has never reached a grand slam quarter-final before, but he’s on his way here. He’s lost in the fourth round on his last two visits to Roland Garros, against Sascha Zverev and ... Andy Murray. Speaking of which:Khachanov offers up a short ball that Del Potro can’t put away. Something not quite right with Delpo – he’s missing chances and has seemed irritable throughout. 40-0 down here, he scraps a couple of points back but the Russian holds with a big serve out wide to lead 7-5, 4-1.Del Potro looks to get into this set but Khachanov isn’t having a bar of it, powering a winner into the corner at deuce. Del Potro’s big serve rescues him, and keeps the second set alive as a contest.An email! “Is there a name for that crowd call and response thing that only seems to happen at Roland Garros?” asks Chris Collinson. “It starts with a soloist belting out a few notes then the whole crowd shouts the French equivalent of “¡Olé!” in response.”Je ne sais pas, Chris. But I’m sure someone out there can enlighten both of us.Two stats that tell a story: Khachanov is 22 on break points, Del Potro 05. And after three games in the second set, Khachanov leads 14-2 on points, and 3-0.Del Potro was on top in that first set without making it count, and all of a sudden, the match could be slipping away. Khachanov has three break points in the second game of this second set – and takes the first! The Russian leads 7-5, 2-0.Here’s the full quarter-final line-up in the women’s draw. Form and seedings point to a Halep v Stephens final, but recent women’s slams have been about as predictable as the Pakistan cricket team.After absorbing plenty of heat on his own serve, Khachanov makes a dent on his opponent’s, carving out a break and set point. He digs in to stay in the rally, and takes the set when Del Potro nets a backhand!All too easy for the up-and-coming American, who will face Simona Halep in the quarter-finals.Delpo now putting the pressure on Khachanov, some hefty winners earning him a sniff at a break. The Russian hammers down aces to deny him twice, and gets the hold. Five break points passed up by Del Potro in this set.England v Pakistan is going down to the wire at the Cricket World Cup. Sport – it just keeps giving. You can drop in on that with Rob Smyth:Del Potro seems to have regained his rhythm, firing down big first serves and coming into the net to try and keep the rallies short. He holds for five all.Incidentally, whoever wins this game, the quarter-finals look absolutely stacked. Seven of the top 10 seeds, and a previous winner in Stan Wawrinka.Del Potro’s gears appear to have been ground by a mobile phone going off in the crowd, and then being censured by the umpire for swearing in Spanish. Khachanov is focusing on the job in hand, holding to go 5-4 up.On Simonne-Mathieu, the last women’s quarter-final place is up for grabs. 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova is on course to take it, leading Aliona Bolsova 6-3, 2-0.Thanks Jacob, evening all. It’s been a predictably gritty affair between Khachanov and Del Potro early on. Three games all, and the Argentinian is currently mithering at the umpire.My work is done. Luckily Niall McVeigh has arrived to take you through to the end of the day’s play. Bye!On Suzanne-Lenglen some tennis balls could be in for some punishment until the end of play. Juan Martin del Potro, the eighth seed, is in action against the powerful young Russian Karen Khachanov. On Simonne-Mathieu, meanwhile, the USA’s Amanda Anisimova is in action against Spain’s Aliona Bolsova. Anisimova is one to watch.It’s all over in 45 minutes. Whoosh. Halep was way too accomplished for her young Polish opponent, who will do well to learn from this free lesson from the defending champion.A zany, slightly madcap match ends with Zverev taking his third match point when Fognini batters a forehand long. It’s Zverev’s first win over a top-20 player this year and his first ever win over a top-20 player at a grand slam. The fifth seed will play Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals after fighting back to deal with the erratic Fognini.Fabio Fognini has just saved two match points in the tie-break against Alexander Zverev. Zverev can serve for it now.Simona Halep really isn’t hanging about. She leads 6-1, 5-0 and is mercilessly crushing Iga Swiatek’s hopes and dreams.Fabio Fognini holds to love with a contemptuous drop shot. He’s got himself a fourth-set tie-break.Pah.

The developers in the audience are VERY EXCITED about how much less code you need to write a UI compared to before. You can also see the preview update live when you edit the code, which is again VERY EXCITING to the audience.We move into the really nerdy bit: new APIs for developers who work with AR or Apple’s programming language Swift.Skip this if that makes no sense to you. If it does:ARKit 3 gets demo’d onstage by (the Microsoft-owned) Mojang, creators of Minecraft, who show off the new Minecraft Earth. You can build a world, walk around inside it, and play with friends. It looks fun, though “it’s hard to believe that there’s nothing on the ground or around us on the stage” has to win the prize for least convincing line delivery of the event.A big launch for developers: “Project Catalyst” lets developers “quickly and easily develop Mac apps from their iPad apps”. “This means one development team for the first time can build a single app that can  all the way from iPhone to iPad to Mac.”Mac apps that are coming at launch: the game Asphalt 9: Legends, Twitter and Atlassian’s Jira.Federighi continues with the new features:And finally, macOS! Craig Federighi returns to reveal that the new release is called Catalina, after Santa Catalina Island in California.And then we jump straight in to an obituary for iTunes. Federighi gently mocks the app’s history, uttering the definitely-not-true line that “Customers Love iTunes”, and that they’ve been asking whether it can do “even more”, joking that the next version will have a calendar and web browser as well.In fact, it’s being split: Music, Podcasts and TV will replace the single iTunes app. Phone management, meanwhile, will occur in the Finder for the first time.Music and Podcasts look very similar to the old iTunes, although Podcasts gains a new auto-transcription feature letting you search the contents of podcasts. And the TV app looks basically the same as the TV app on Apple TVs and iPads.We get a price and release date! The Mac Pro will start at $5999, this autumn. (Expect that to be £5999). And the pro display will start at $4999, with an anti-glare version for $5999, and will also be available this autumn.There’s also a new Apple Pro display. It’s HDR enabled. It has a cheesegrater back, just like the new Mac Pro. It has a 6K resolution and a 32” panel. It looks a bit like an iMac.Apple is launching it by comparing it to a $43,000 reference monitor, which is some interesting anchoring. Anything will look like good value when it’s compared to the price of a mid-sized car.There’s a lot of specs coming for the Mac Pro: it has a 28 core Intel Xeon, with 300 watts of power, supporting 1.5TB of Ram, and 8 internal PCIe slots. It has built in ethernet, four Thunderbolt 3 slots, two USB-A slots and a 3.5mm headphone jack.It also has a new built-in graphics module, the MPX, that lets users dock powerful AMD graphics cards in a… new fancy way. But they can also dock normal graphics cards in a normal way.There’s also another card called Afterburner, which users can buy purely to speed up their video rendering and playback. And it has wheels.Back to Tim, who turns us towards the Mac – and the first new hardware of the day: the Mac Pro.It no longer looks like a small wastepaper bin. In fact, it looks like… the old Power Mac:Moving on to the newest OS in Apple’s line-up: today is the 0th birthday of iPadOS! Happy Birthday iPadOS!Why the spin-off? Because as the iPad has become more and more of a computer, it’s got more and more features to itself.And again, we get the round-up of things that just missed the keynote:Now for the accessory roundup!Airpods: Siri can read messages as soon as they arrive and you can instantly respond. And if two people have airpods and iPhones, they can now share audio just by tapping phones together, and listen at the same time.Homepod: Get home and put your phone near the homepod to hand off music or a phone call to the smart speaker. It’s also getting live radio for the first time via Tune-In. And the speaker can personalise responses based on who is speaking for messages, reminders, notes, music and more.Carplay: You can now have music and maps visible at the same time. Siri is now a popover, with the screen remaining visible when the voice assistant is active.Siri: Last year’s Shortcuts feature will get an upgrade, giving you suggested Siri shortcuts automatically. And Siri is getting an AI voice for the first time, ditching the old human recordings for good. It sounds better!Camera and Photos are also getting some new features – simple video editing in Photos, a new depth-sensitive filter in the Camera, and a whole new way of browsing photos in the main app: Apple’s going to use machine learning to intelligently hide duplicates, and to select new thumbnails that reflect a given day, month or year.(It will be interesting to see how good Apple is at selecting these photos without access to the huge personal data stores of Facebook or Google. You may just have told your phone your loved-ones’ birthdays, but can it easily tell a meaningful shot from a half-arsed selfie?)iMessage users can now choose to share their name and memoji (the dead-eyed avatars that Apple introduced two years ago) with people when they text them for the first time. And memoji get yet more variations: make-up, accessories and a variety of haircuts and colours are added to the options.If you don’t want to film yourself making odd faces, Apple’s now adding a sticker pack of your own personal memoji letting you send yourself in pre-made poses. (Like Bitmoji, if you’ve ever used that Snapchat feature before.) And those features are coming to any Apple device with an A9 chip or newer – iPhone 6 or later.And Apple now takes the fight to Amazon and its Ring subsidiary, offering a new API for smart home security cameras. HomeKit Security Cameras will share footage with your Apple devices, in a way that means the manufacturer can’t watch the footage, even if they wanted to.But not everything is about competition: a new feature for secure routers is being built with another Amazon subsidiary, Eero.Craig Federighi returns, to hit Google and Facebook with a big stick labelled Privacy.That last one is a big, big threat to the business model of not just Google and Facebook, but a whole host of companies that require all the personal information of their users to monetise their services.So what does “Dark Mode” mean for iOS? A new wallpaper for the background and slightly darker see-through widgets leaves the lock screen looking barely different, but open an app and the change is more obvious: apps are black, not white.It’s pretty, but fairly obvious, so it’s no surprising that Craig Fed drops other reveals in the dark mode walkthrough as well:And then on to the other apps. Mail gets ‘desktop-class formatting’, Notes gets a new filing system, and Reminders gets an almost total rewrite: quick entry, links to people, and an advanced tracking system.Maps has been rebuilt “from the ground up” (in California), and will be across the US by the end of 2019, and “select other countries” in 2020.Meg Frost, a director of product research at Apple, works through more changes to Maps. Users can make add favourites to their app, or put locations in “collections”, letting them collect groups of places when, for instance, planning a trip. They can then take a closer look using Street View – sorry, “Look Around”, Apple’s own version of the venerable Google feature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc896c28070690d234e150cacbf11d17ed688a8c/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d81f481b5eed191799687f4b395225df","title":"europe uk theme parks family days out readers","story":"From Moomins in Finland to zooming down slides in the Pyrenees, our readers pick thrilling parks across EuropeThis mountain park is home to Tobotronc, a really exhilarating 5km toboggan run – the world’s longest alpine slide – which runs through evergreen forest.

In the hills above Lucca, in Collodi, home of the Pinocchio creator Carlo Lorenzini (pen name Carlo Collodi) it celebrates the famous story with quaint and charming rides, activities and a maze in a peaceful woodland setting.

Nursery rhymes, pirates, cowboys, fairytales, dinosaurs, underwater scenes, ghosts and ghouls all connect with childhood fantasies. There has been some modernisation, including moving dinosaurs and waterslides. The Cliffhanger rollercoaster makes the most of its location, with views of the sea 120 metres below.

It has been joyful, silly and wild, and while it feels like the perfect and necessary time to wrap up their adventures, it is poignant that they’ve done so by reminding you just how good those can be. Read moreAnother comedy that went out on a high, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney’s tale of floundering parents managed to deliver more home truths about the family unit, pay fond tribute to late guest star Carrie Fisher – and offer up one of the most shocking endings in recent TV history.What we said: From first to last, Catastrophe has been an unremitting triumph. Read the full reviewAlready sitting atop IMDb’s top 250 TV shows list before the final episode has even aired, Sky and HBO’s restaging of the Soviet nuclear disaster captures the ineptitude, corruption and horror at its core.What we said: Chernobyl is a disaster movie, a spy movie, a horror movie, a political thriller, and a human drama, and it spins each plate expertly. The terror is unflinching and explicit, and its images of burned bodies collapsing into putrid decay are impossible to forget. Yet it never feels shocking for the sake of it, only as haunting and horrible as its subject matter demands. Read moreAfter years spent hinting at the damage done to our planet by the climate crisis , David Attenborough finally laid out the threat in all its magnitude, in a documentary that may just have turned sceptics into believers.What we said: This is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. Read the full reviewE4’s comedy accurately captured the loneliness and mundanity, but also the sense of community, that comes with picking up a controller. All that, and it was as addictive as an all-night Fifa session to boot.What we said: This wickedly entertaining new sitcom may have been inspired by the massive success of online games like World of Warcraft but, thankfully, you are not required to know your Azeroth from your elbow to enjoy it. Read moreOne of last year’s surprise hits, Lisa McGee’s Northern Irish comedy didn’t let things slip in its second season, with its quartet still finding teenage kicks in the midst of the Troubles. The scene in which teens from both sides of the sectarian ide unleashed a barrage of stereotypes about each other (“Protestants hate ABBA!”) is among the year’s funniest.What we said: Derry Girls’ magic remains intact. The evocation of the 90s is as lightly done as ever (Elizabeth Hurley is fleetingly referenced – “She’s a total ride, but she paperclips her frocks together”) and the Troubled setting never overwhelms but simply throws into relief the ordinariness of the girls’ lives in the middle of extraordinary depths of conflict. Read the full reviewPulling off a state-of-the-Brexit-nation series looked a tall order, but Toby Jones’s understated comedy-drama was taller, finding humour and pathos in its tale of a coach driver who discovers a refugee hiding in his wheel arch and a body washed up on the beach.What we said: If it is a comedy, it is one with the bleakest tragedy at its heart. But whatever label you put on it, it is a fine, fine piece of work. Read the full reviewBack for its second (and, as it turned out, final) outing, Fleabag added a hot priest into the already heady mix of biting wit and family dysfunction – and it built to a heart-rending ending with a wedding, a mad dash to the airport … and a fox. Unforgettable.What we said: Series two raised the bar. Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s risks were so impressive all one could do was shake one’s head in appreciation. Read the full reviewDid the gargantuan fantasy drama stick the landing in its final season? That’s an argument for the comments section, but both in the scale of its six episodes, and the fevered discussion they prompted, it was unquestionably the TV event of the year.What we said: The ending was true to the series’ overall subject – war, and the pity of war – and, after doing a lot of wrong to several protagonists, it did right by those left standing. When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Overall, I think, it won. Read the full reviewSally Wainwright travelled back in time for her latest piece of thrillingly human Yorkshire drama, with this real life tale of Anne Lister. Suranne Jones has received rave reviews for her portrayal of the 19th-century industrialist and diarist, who developed a code to hide her lesbianism.What we said: It’s Regency Fleabag! Because the heroine occasionally breaks the fourth wall and exteriorises her inner monologue. But it’s set in Halifax in 1832, so it could be Northern Jane Austen. Then again, it’s about Anne Lister, who has been dubbed the first modern lesbian, so maybe it’s Queer Brontë ... You can afford to have a little fun with Gentleman Jack Sally Wainwright clearly has. Read the full reviewThe Horrible Histories team offered up more unashamedly silly comedy with this spirited sitcom about a group of ghouls going to war with the new owners of a crumbling mansion.What we said: In making us giggle at the supernatural, Ghosts is very British. But it is American in the sense of having a gag-to-airtime ratio much higher than British sitcoms normally manage these days. Read the full reviewThis deliriously absurd sketch show from a former Saturday Night Live player was hailed immediately as one of the greatest Netflix shows to date.What we said: I wolfed down the entire series in one sitting, genuinely incapacitated with laughter. And then I watched it all again. I’m at the stage where I’m cherrypicking sketches now, but I’ve seen my favourites six or seven times. I’m fully obsessed at this point. At its peak, I think I Think You Should Leave might be one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Read moreA devastating four-hour exposé of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson. Wade Robson and James Safechuck chillingly and plausibly outlined their accounts of childhood grooming by the man that they, and the whole world, worshipped.What we said: An astonishing piece of work. Relentlessly spare and unsensationalist, it manages better than any other in its genre not to let its attention wander from the survivors’ testimony. Footage of Jackson is confined almost wholly to that of him with the boys themselves on stage, private calls between them and family snaps. He is never allowed to overwhelm the story. Read the full reviewJed Mercurio’s police corruption masterpiece returned for a fifth outing after a two-year wait, bringing with it a stunningly complex performance from Stephen Graham, more urgent exits required … and heartstopping, jaw-dropping action to the last.What we said: As ever, nothing is wasted not a scene, not a line, not a beat. It fits together flawlessly – you can imagine Mercurio sitting like a watchmaker at his table with the parts spread before him and fitting the loupe to his eye before assembling the whole thing and listening for its perfectly regulated tick. Read the full reviewStefan Golaszewski’s sitcom tour de force ended on a heartwarming high. Over three lovely series, Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan as Cathy and Michael gave us the gift of a quietly epic romance that will echo down the ages – and kept the tears in our eyes.What we said: Mum might have looked like it was just a sitcom, but it had something beautiful to say about love and loss. It’s said it. Read the full reviewAssembling the largest collection of trans actors in televisual history, Ryan Murphy’s big-hearted drama about the voguing scene in 1980s New York had style, grace, swagger and sass for days. What’s not to love?What we said: Razzle-dazzle showmanship isn’t Pose’s only source of infectious joy. Watching the slow, still-unfolding process of these characters becoming more and more their true selves is as exhilarating as the opening bars of Cheryl Lynn’s Got to be Real. Self-actualisation isn’t easy, but it sure is beautiful. Read the full reviewFollowing a young woman with a form of OCD called Pure O, which manifests as constant invasive thoughts about sex, this comedy-drama was among the year’s frankest and most fearless TV.What we said: The drama and the gags are never sacrificed to worthy exposition, virtue-signalling or finger-wagging, but, at the same time, the series has so evidently been made in good faith that you can surrender to it entirely, never fearing that it will put a foot wrong. Read the full reviewA hipster Groundhog Day, but also so much more, Natasha Lyonne’s comedy about a thirtysomething trapped in a time loop of death and rebirth proved a truly mind-bending proposition.What we said: Russian Doll is an acquired taste. But do persist: there is such a fine, idiosyncratic, impressive show nested within. Read the full reviewGillian Anderson starred as Jean, a sex therapist whose son Otis (Asa Butterfield) – though too anxious to masturbate himself – sets up a sex advice service at school. A punchy, horny comedy, with the added bonus of the fantastic Ncuti Gatwa as Otis’s best friend Eric. Worth watching for his heroic prom outfit alone.What we said: Endlessly and seemingly effortlessly funny, in a naturalistic way that doesn’t have you listening for the hooves of the next gag thundering down a well-worn track but, like Catastrophe, catches you almost unawares and makes you bark with laughter. Read the full reviewArthur Cary’s thoughtful, wonderful and always dignified 90-minute documentary heard the stories of some of the last living people who survived concentration camps as children. A very important work indeed.What we said: For an hour and a half, I was crying, especially when Cary followed three generations of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz, knowing all the time that tears are not enough. Nor guilt. Read the full reviewHow would you react if you could barely get cast as Man Who Smells Fart in an advert while your kid brother became a Bieber-esque teen hearthrob overnight? That’s the premise of this brilliant satire, which skewers our pop-culture-obsessed society spectacularly.What we said: It has heart, charm, steel, belly laughs and a gimlet eye. Get on it. Read the full reviewJohn Hannah and Kelly Macdonald starred in an intelligent drama about a vigilante attack on a potential child killer that managed to ask ever more challenging questions as its episodes rolled on.What we said: It is a drama that resonates with its time by asking what constitutes a victim and how much leeway we allow in bestowing that status. Do they have to be perfect? How sure do we have to be? And what happens when the perpetrator becomes a victim too, of a different kind? Read the full reviewShane Meadows reunited with This is England star Stephen Graham for an unflinching drama about a troubled dad attempting to reunite with his long-lost sister and process childhood sexual abuse.What we said: Unspoken pain infuses every scene, every gesture and expression from Stephen Graham and in doing so lays the foundations to do justice to the suffering of victims everywhere. Read the full reviewLiza Williams’s three-part documentary revisited one of the biggest – and longest – murder manhunts in British history, taking us back to a time so different it seemed almost foreign.What we said: At its best, Williams’ series – with its mixture of archive footage and new interviews – is a social document. The hindsight it offers is not primarily about the mishandling of the investigation, but of the grim tone of the times. Read the full reviewThe excruciating monkey tennis-pitcher went back to the BBC for a One Show-style magazine programme. Inevitably – and hilariously for viewers – it wasn’t the smoothest of returns.What we said: We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony and lie limp from laughter, hatred, panic, despair or in awe at the end of another half-hour in his appalling company, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. Read the full reviewA last hurrah for Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s mendacious yet incompetent vice-president, in a political satire that was perfectly attuned for these most buffoonish of times.What we said: Louis-Dreyfus has won a record six Emmy awards for her role as Selina Meyer, and, frankly, it’s no wonder. She is magnificent, brittle and furiously amoral. In this seventh and final season of Veep, it appears to be getting out while it still has a hope in hell of making its fictional world look more comedic than the real one. Read the full reviewAva DuVernay’s staggering miniseries about the Central Park Five showed how a group of young boys came to be falsely convicted for raping a young white woman in 1989. It is unbearably harrowing to watch the boys, as young as 13, get violently coerced by police into giving confessions.What we said: The performances are uniformly astonishing – especially from the central five, Asante Blackk, Caleel Harris, Ethan Herisse, Marquis Rodriguez and Jharrel Jerome, most of whom are just a few years older than the teens they are playing. They capture the innocence, in all senses, of children, and the permanence of its loss. It feels like a great privilege to see them. Read the full reviewRussell T Davies’s hugely ambitious drama followed a family through the next 15 years of British life, taking in the migrant crisis, terrifying technological innovations and Trump’s increasingly fraught face-off with China.What we said: For a series that compresses 15 years into six hours, it seems to pass in the blink of an eye thanks to Russell T Davies’s trademark humour, compassion and the kinetic energy with which he infuses every project. We do not deserve Davies, but thank God he’s here. Read the full reviewFollowing her projects about breasts and penises, artist Laura Dodsworth photographed a range of women’s vulvas, then showed the sitters their vaginal portraits and interviewed them for their responses. The result? Intimate, empowering television, unlike anything that has ever aired before.What we said: A gently but relentlessly radical documentary. It’s not until you see a full set of female genitals filling your screen that you realise how little you see anything of or about them in wider culture.

As the Up series hits 63, the man whose story gripped a nation explains why he won’t be watchingWhen Seven Up first aired in May 1964, it featured 14 very different seven-year-olds, all revealing their thoughts and aspirations to the camera. The prep school boys were already eyeing Charterhouse and Cambridge. East Ender Lynn Johnson wanted to work in Woolworths. The curveball was Neil Hughes, a moptopped little Liverpudlian who announced: “I want to be an astronaut.”The title of that first series came from an old Jesuit saying: “Give me the child until he is seven and I will give you the man.” The seven-yearly series returns this week with 63 Up. Did Hughes make it into space? “You know what kids are like,” he laughs as we meet for coffee at a hotel in Penrith, Cumbria. “If they’d filmed me a week later, I might have said something completely different.” The moptop is gone, too.While the posh boys became barristers and Johnson a librarian, the Up cameras tracked Hughes’s dramatic experiences with depression, squats, homelessness and destitution. And then 42 Up revealed his remarkable transformation into a Liberal Democrat councillor and a lay preacher. (He also stood, unsuccessfully, at the 2010 general election.)Although his ups and downs have gripped viewers for decades, Hughes is keen to point out – genially – that Up is very much director Michael Apted’s “interpretation” of his life. “For most people,” he says, “what’s on TV is more real than the truth. But people must remember that there’s someone behind the camera.” Hughes stopped watching the series after 21 Up. In fact, he virtually stopped watching TV altogether. “People tell me I’m portrayed as triumphing over the odds,” he says. “But that’s not how I see my life at all. I’m grateful for the successes, but I see my life ultimately as a failure. I’ve failed in almost everything I’ve tried to do.”He describes himself as “reclusive” and “a bit eccentric”. He doesn’t own a mobile phone and finds modern society baffling: “How can anyone want to spend their time tapping away on a device?” But he was so keen for the world to hear his side of his story that he penned an autobiography: it exists in a single, unpublished hard copy. “It’s my truth, in case anyone is interested.”So what did happen to that gentle, hopeful little boy who charmed a nation by skipping happily to school? Picked for Seven Up for his enthusiasm and opinions, Hughes, the son of two teachers, says he had a happy childhood, though not quite as idyllic as depicted. “We had family arguments. You’d go on holiday all cheerful and come back in a silent car.” In 14 Up, however, he was agitated and complained of being unable to relax. “I went to a rough school and got bullied a lot,” he says. “I got beaten up several times and, to be fair, I beat people up as well.” At the age of 16, he was diagnosed with a “nervous complaint”. He adored literature and, after reading Brideshead Revisited, dreamed of going to Oxford. He got the required grades but flunked the admission exam. “I think I misquoted someone,” he sighs. It haunted him for years. He spent six months hitchhiking to toughen himself up. “When I think of the risks I took, the places I stayed, the people I associated with, I swallow hard.” He ended up at Aberdeen university, studying languages and law when Scottish nationalist students mounted what he calls a “soviet-style takeover” of student halls. “If you were not Scots, then woe betide you. Nobody threatened me, but it was a horrible atmosphere.”Dropping out after the first term, he slid into years of menial jobs and life on benefits, to the chagrin of his father. He worked in hotels and as a grouse-beater. “You don’t actually beat the grouse,” he laughs, and I realise that the Up cameras have not done a great job of capturing his warm, dry sense of humour. “But if they were half-killed, then you had to wring their necks. As a teenager you don’t care, but later you think, ‘What am I doing to serve the planet?’”In 28 Up, he was homeless in the Highlands, sleeping in sheds, while 35 Up found him on a council estate on Shetland, visibly struggling with his mental health, but he says it wasn’t quite the torrid time the show presented. “When I got there, a quarter of the community had no television,” he says. “But being completely isolated, you learn to depend on the few people who are there, and also to be more robust.” He read avidly, overcame his rejection of religion and realised the power of community. “I knew I had to go into politics. Shetland changed me as a person. And the northern lights – spectacular!”By 42 Up, everything had transformed again, thanks to another Seven Up participant. In that very first series, boarding school boy Bruce Balden said he wanted to help poorer people. After seeing Hughes’s struggles, his adult version – who had taught in Bangladesh and London’s East End – reached out, putting Hughes up at his home in London, then finding him a basement flat in Hackney, where he finally obtained a degree via the Open University. “Bruce was a great help,” Hughes smiles. “I couldn’t hold down a job, but I wanted to contribute to society.”When he first went along to Hackney Lib Dems, the “ruthlessness” shocked him. “One guy would stop at nothing to get what he wanted,” he says. “I didn’t think I was tough enough for that world, but when we knocked on doors my experiences meant I could chat to anybody, whatever their situation. I didn’t have to make anything up.” Finally, tiring of London politics, he visited friends in Cumbria – a childhood holiday haunt – and stayed, eventually swapping his caravan for a housing association cottage. “Politics is very different here,” he says. “I enjoy helping people, empowering communities.”These days, he ides his time between his councillor duties, the church and voluntary work in an Oxfam shop. This week’s 63 Up reveals that he got married – to a woman he met in panto – but after four years the relationship ended, owing to his recurring low moods. “I’ve still not got over that.”His parents have died, too, but there had been a reconciliation. “I got on better with my mum when she had dementia,” he says with a sigh. “All my life, she’d been trying to mould me into something I wasn’t. But by the end she seemed to accept the way I was.” Hughes seems to view his own life as one of shattered dreams. “If I’d been successful, I’d have been in Westminster, stopping this hideous government or I’d be in theatre, directing what I wanted.”That said, he recently helped to get rid of a “rubbish council”, is campaigning passionately to restore the Keswick-Penrith railway line – and he still dares to dream. “If you can change the neighbourhood you live in,” he says, “you can change the world.” His eyes are sparkling, just like the eyes of that would-be astronaut back in 1964.• 63 Up is on ITV at 9pm on 4, 5 and 6 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d493d5bc3746454d98492de9393682b6f95d2db/189_0_2811_1687/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dfc6ee1eca61cc8ac6cf4415a40a203","title":"the truth about chlorinated chicken review an instant appetite ruiner","story":"Just in time for Trump’s UK visit, Channel 4’s Dispatches looked at the food standard implications of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. It wasn’t a pretty sightDonald Trump has come to Britain, and in honour of his state visit, Channel 4 devoted half an hour to something equally toxic that may soon follow in his wake: an invading army of chlorinated chickens.In Dispatches: The Truth About Chlorinated Chicken, the presenter Kate Quilton travelled to the United States to investigate American poultry production. It was the kind of programme best viewed after eating. You wouldn’t be terribly hungry when it finished.Chlorinated chicken is an emotive subject, and a slightly misleading one: as disgusting as it sounds, the chlorine itself is not the problem. American chicken doesn’t taste like a swimming pool. Most of it tastes a bit like chicken.The problem is that the practice of chlorine washing (though sometimes other chemicals are used) is said to be a poor substitute for the hygiene measures that should take place earlier in the processing chain, but, in the US, are not legally required. For this reason, chlorinated chicken has been banned from the EU for 22 years. If and when Brexit happens, the UK may well be obliged to accept chlorinated poultry as part of any separate trade deal with the US. Agricultural exports are a priority for US negotiators – it would be difficult to make an exception for chicken.Indeed, chlorine washing may prevent the detection of contaminants through ordinary testing, because it partially masks the problem. Quilton had no trouble finding a Texas restaurant owner who will swear there is nothing wrong with American chicken – “Not a thing. Superior quality and flavour”. But the numbers speak for themselves: US rates of campylobacter infection are 10 times higher than in the UK. The US records hundreds of salmonella deaths a year the UK has in recent years recorded none.Central to the programme was footage shot inside a giant processing plant by an undercover employee. Looking at it, a former EU meat inspector was able to identify several flagrant violations of good hygiene practice and even the plant’s own policies, but there was more sickening stuff on display: a supervisor is overheard talking about “a trend of adulterated product”, by which she means glass in the chicken, and also making reference to a recent “amputation”. To me, the word amputation brings to mind an operation performed by a professional for the good of a patient, and not, as in this instance, some poultry worker losing three fingers in a machine.One study found 95 such “amputations” over a single year in American poultry processing, making it one of the most dangerous occupations in the US. Debbie Berkowitz, a former chief of staff at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), who now campaigns for employment rights, maintains that the industry is also exploitative: employees, her office found, were routinely denied basic rights, including toilet breaks. “Workers did not want to have to soil themselves,” she said. “So they wore diapers on the line.”In response to the programme’s investigation, a statement issued by the US Food Safety and Inspection Service offered not just blanket denials, but a kind of breezy contempt: “Unfounded allegations from former OSHA staffers are not credible contributions to this dialogue.”The whole programme was enough to put you off chicken for a week – possibly for life – but, as Quilton concluded, it was about more than chicken. “It’s about food standards, it’s about worker’s rights, it’s about animal welfare,” she said. It’s also about money: thanks to the less robust regulatory regime, American chicken is a fifth cheaper than its UK counterpart. The chlorine, you get for free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26d713125ece83663439de890f58a0b86a06aa2/0_0_1520_912/master/1520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b137929fa58b3327085b8a17f33dbea3","title":"the president of the united states cant talk like this to the very queen of england","story":"Donald Trump is having tea with Queen Elizabeth II but you can’t get upset"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c597b0d44508682b16f8e82d0a541f772ea25ffd/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1e840c66f02ae08e1f806899db2f7b3","title":"canada indigenous genocide women report","story":"Canadians can no longer turn a blind eye to the “genocide” of Indigenous peoples in the country, a landmark report on missing and murdered women has concluded.Indigenous communities across the country have for decades attempted to convey the depth and scope of a tragedy that has haunted thousands of families.As many as 4,000 Indigenous women and girls are believed to have been killed or gone missing in Canada over the past 30 years – although the true number of victims is unlikely ever to be known.On Monday the findings of a three-year inquiry were released at a solemn ceremony in Quebec, attended by victims’ families, survivors, Indigenous leaders and senior government officials.“This is an uncomfortable day for Canada,” said the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “We have failed you. We will fail you no longer.”The inquiry’s final report, a 1,200-page catalogue of historical and contemporary injustices, concludes that decades of policy and state indifference amounted to genocide against Indigenous peoples.The report’s authors were blunt in their assessment: “If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention … This is every Canadian’s responsibility not to turn a blind eye.”The report, called Reclaiming Power and Place, marks the government’s most signifiant attempt at determining the scope of the epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women.Commission members conceded that the term “genocide” is likely to provoke controversy in the country but said they carefully examined the United Nations definition of the term – as well as its original intent from the 1940s.“Genocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions, and actions detailed within this report,” they wrote.The inquiry accepted submissions from 2,380 people, including the testimony of 468 family members of survivors and victims across the country at 15 community hearings.“Many Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue,” the commissioners wrote.The report also includes 231 recommendations for future action.“It must be understood that these recommendations, which we frame as ‘Calls for Justice,’ are legal imperatives – they are not optional,” said the report.The wide-ranging recommendations include overhauling policing practices in Indigenous communities, giving Indigenous languages official status, creating a universal basic income and investing in early childhood programs for Indigenous youth.While the document exposes a damning narrative of the country’s history, it also encourages a path forward.“For many non-Indigenous people, it’s important to be ready to ‘unlearn’ some learned behaviours,” said the report.Veldon Coburn, who teaches Indigenous studies at Carleton University, said Canadians need to understand the role of state institutions such as residential schools where more than 150,000 aboriginal children were taken in an attempt to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society — and work to dismantle those practices.But he added that Canadians also need to work to dismantle those practices.“There shouldn’t be any settler Canadian who should feel personally responsible for this. They’ve never carried this out themselves,” he said. “It should be forward looking, in the true spirit of reconciliation with one another, saying we want to live in a community and respect the existence of our shared humanity.”Before Canadian society begins to grapple with such difficult questions, Coburn said attention should be focused on the memories of the thousands of Indigenous peoples were murdered or have gone missing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0edb6eadce1862ef8f884cf5d1bc32b40f012a15/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=275f357b88da4cbcc6c5b6c93c6cf68e","title":"d day 75th anniversary interviews","story":"The stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week’s commemorationsThousands of people are preparing to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings at commemoration events in the UK and France this week. Senior politicians and members of the royal family as well as hundreds of veterans will attend ceremonies to mark one of the main turning points of the second world war and the biggest amphibious invasion in military history.More than 200 veterans have boarded a cruise ship, MV Boudicca, charted by the Royal British Legion, to attend the events, while others are descending en masse on Portsmouth and Normandy. Here we hear the stories of those who were there on 6 June 1944 and others involved in this week’s commemorations.Percy Lewis, 96, a wireless operator with No 6 Beach Group, spent most of D-day sheltering in the sand dunes off Sword beach. After landing at 11am on a small landing craft, he had to wait for the rest of his battalion to come. “Now and again there were a few shells coming over, but all the infantry and tanks had gone,” he said. The remainder of the second world war, however, would not prove so straightforward for him.Lewis, from Guildford, was evacuated and treated in Staffordshire before returning, this time to the Netherlands. In October 1944, while advancing through the country, his platoon found themselves at night in a small village “somewhere in the Venray area” and occupied the crossroads.But he had to retrace his steps to retrieve some wireless equipment. “I started walking back alone, rifle over my shoulder, and the moon had just come up behind my back. I got a fair way back. Someone shouted: ‘Halt.’ I said: ‘Friend.’ Nothing. I walked a bit further. ‘Halt.’ I said: ‘Friend.’ Nothing. I took the rifle off my shoulder.“There was a row of cottages. A door was open. I thought: ‘I’ll make for that door.’ And just as I got to the door, Jerry stepped out with his rifle on me. I looked at him. He looked at me. I put my hands up. Two German paratroopers about two doors away pushed me into the middle of the road.“I thought: ‘They’ll start shooting in a minute.’ Nothing happened. They took me round the corner, and down into the cellar. And it was full of German paratroopers cleaning all their kit.”With a rifle pushed into his back, he was handed over to a Panzer ision. He was now a prisoner of war, and would be interned in the Stalag XI-B Fallingbostel PoW camp in Germany. It was liberated in April 1945.“Eleven of us go to Normandy, to Arromanches, every year,” said Lewis, who has regularly given the exhortation on the seafront during the annual commemorations.Ron Smith, 94, an electrician (then known as a wireman) from Rustington, West Sussex, was on landing craft tank (LCT) 947, which approached Sword beach at 7.35am on D-day. As troops disembarked, a shell hit one of the tanks on the landing craft, immobilising it and blocking the craft’s exit ramp. Torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing the colonel on board and three others. Smith helped wrap up the bodies, as the LCT was forced to retreat and make its way back to Portsmouth.“I helped to lay three of them out,” he said. One was Lt Col Arthur Cocks, the first British officer killed in the landings. “He’s now celebrated in Portsmouth Cathedral with a window,” said Smith.On their final briefings, he said: “We were told we were going to France, ‘and you won’t need a passport’.”But nothing could really prepare for the beach landings. “I don’t reckon a winkle survived on that beach. It was just one heap of explosives – it was amazing the way the tanks went off.“As soon as we landed, our role was to clear off quickly so the next could come in.” But after the LCT was hit, “we couldn’t land anything else”.He spent a week in Portsmouth as the LCT was repaired, then headed back to Normandy. But the LCT hit a mine off the coast of Arromanches, near the Mulberry harbour. The crew managed to swim to a nearby merchant ship, which had been deliberately half-sunk to provide defence for the artificial harbour.“We went up a rope, up three steps, and were over the gunnel on to the deck. Then we went to the wheelhouse. And the only thing we rescued was a huge jar of rum. And we drunk the lot,” said Smith. “There were 12 of us, and we were on there for 14 hours.“Everyone was too busy to rescue us. We had to just stop on there. Eventually a landing craft came alongside and we were off. We were taken to an army camp, and they served us with half a loaf of bread and soup you could stand a spoon up in, and it was the best meal I’ve ever tasted. Amazing.”Smith was then dispatched to the UK, where he recovered from his injuries in a hospital in Scotland. He was later sent to Burma.“It’s a long time ago. This is the most I ever talk about it. I was only 19, that’s all I was,” he said.Marie Scott, 92, a switchboard operator, volunteered for the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) at 17. She was posted to the labyrinthine Fort Southwick, the underground Combined Operations Underground HQ, and the nerve centre on D-day, which was run from tunnels deep in the cliffs overlooking Portsmouth. On D-day, her job was as a very high frequency (VHF) radio operator, relaying messages to and from the invasion fleet and landing troops.“It was a series of tunnels. Quite spartan,” she said of Fort Southwick. “The tunnels were very deep. We had to go down about 350 steps to get into the tunnels and, indeed, come up 350 steps. But at 17 you could do it.“We had long shifts, so we had to sleep down there as well. There was no natural light. There was no fresh air. So we had air conditioning and electric lights. On and off I was down there certainly for six to nine months, over D-day and after D-day,” she said.“We knew something big was afoot because there was an armada of boats in Portsmouth harbour. That was a giveaway.“The VHF radio was a one-way system. When you raised your lever to transmit, the recipient couldn’t make any interjections until you had finished, and said: ‘Roger and out.’ or whatever. Then they would raise their lever, and transmit their message”.On D-day she was in direct contact with the wireless operators on the allied invasion fleet as they stormed the beaches.“When they raised their lever, I could hear very loud, sustained gunfire. It was really so bad that you thought: ‘Oh my God. There’s a battle going on.’ You knew. You thought: ‘God, men are dying.’ The reality suddenly hit you. For a rather naive 17-year-old, I think it was terrifying. But it was a job. You got on with it.“The messages were all in code, so you didn’t know what was being said. But you could hear the gunfire, every time the lever was lifted. I’ve never forgotten what I heard. Never.”On the 75th anniversary, Scott, from New Malden, Surrey, will be in Normandy, travelling as a guest of the Taxi Charity, that annually takes veterans to Normandy. This year more than 30 taxis will be involved.It will be a special moment for Scott, who after the war became a secretary, married, raised a family and then worked for Surrey county council. She has been awarded the Legion D’Honneur by the French, which will be presented by a French general at a ceremony at the Pegasus museum in Ranville.“I’m deeply honoured, and very humbled. You feel that you can’t be deserving because men laid down their lives. We were the backroom people,” she said. “It’s overwhelming, really. And it’s going to be fantastic.“All that really concerns me is that somebody will be available – hopefully a strapping young soldier or sailor or airman – to help me up the steps!”He saw one LCT break up. “They weren’t really meant for that sort of sea,” said Jennings, from Emsworth, near Chichester.“Apparently, we landed on the wrong side of the beach. It should have been further left, I think, but we didn’t know it at the time. I can still see it. It’s like a ciné film. I can see us coming in and thinking: ‘Well, there were mines on the beach.’ There were all sorts there. Luckily, the tide took us and we landed on a reasonably safe beach.”His abiding memory was wishing “just to get back, to be honest”.Jennings said: “I’m just one of thousands who was doing the job you were trained for. I’m nothing special.” He continued to ferry troops back and forth across the Channel during the liberation.Bill Gladden, 95, who was in the 6th Airborne Armoured Recce Regiment, was 20 years old when he took off from a Dorset airfield on D-day in a Hamilcar glider, which dwarfed the Halifax towing it. It was the first time tanks had been flown into a battlefield, and he was squashed alongside one tank and six motorbikes, weighing a total of 16 tonnes.As they crossed the Channel he climbed on top of the tank to look out of a porthole. But then, suddenly, the towrope dropped. “I felt the towrope go, because once it drops it’s like you hit a brick wall. I couldn’t move, I just hung on, and that’s how I landed in Normandy, spread-eagled on top of a Tetrarch tank.”Their job was to quickly make their way to Ranville Bridge over the Orne, taken earlier in the day, and hold it. He spent his first night in Normandy dug in there, then he moved to an orchard at Ranville. His stay would be brief.“Each day we went out, pretty deep into the countryside, to find out where the Germans were and report back,” said Gladden. “We got chased back a few times.“I’d been there about 12 days. We could hear the Germans start up their tanks of a morning. And, although we used to go out quite a bit, the fighting went on in the Ranville area for a long time.”On 18 June he came back from patrol as usual. “And I was just about to pour the water out and have a brew up when suddenly there was a bang, and I was on my back.” A German Tiger tank had fired on the group. The whole of the front of his ankle was blown off. “I had just my Achilles holding my foot on,” he said.Colleagues carried him to an old barn used to treat casualties. Two days earlier, Gladden had helped carry the bodies of two friends to the same barn. “Little did I know that within the next two days they would be carrying me over.“I didn’t feel any pain at first. When the pain comes on, they start pushing the old morphine into you. And then you sail away.”He remembers coming to a field hospital. Doctors were struggling to save his foot. “‘Amputation considered’: that was on the ticket I read around my neck when I came to, lying on a stretcher on the grass being sick as a dog.”Gladden was evacuated to the UK. He spent the following three years in hospital, with his foot only finally being saved by a sophisticated bone graft involving both his legs being temporarily sewn and plastered together. His foot has troubled him ever since. The injury meant he was discharged from the army on medical grounds.“I count myself very lucky,” said Gladden, from Welling, Kent, who went on to work in the accounts department at Siemens. “I survived, thousands didn’t.”He has returned to Ranville 10 times during recent years, since becoming a widower, and was heading there again for the 75th anniversary of D-day as a guest of the Taxi Charity. “It’s a nostalgic visit. And it is nice to get thanks from the people out there. But I think the main thing is to keep alive the fact that victory didn’t come cheap.“There were thousands of young men who were killed and maimed in those first few days, and we just don’t want any more wars. That’s the way I look at it.”Before the 75th commemorations, seven surviving veterans from the Battle of Normandy and D-day were honoured at an event at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.Chelsea pensioner Bill Fitzgerald, 94, who served with the Sussex regiment and was only 18 at the time, said: “We were the third in on the day. We got so far in and then we hit something underneath, so we knew we were going to get wet.“The beach master was there shouting out: ‘Get off this bloody beach and don’t get killed.’“The water was full of bodies and they were mostly all Marine Commandos – but you couldn’t take too much notice, all you were thinking of was helping each other,” he said. “Looking at the bodies, you felt sorry about it, but you had a job to get on that beach and wait for your friends.”He was injured nine days after D-day in a shelling on 15 June. “We had a horrible day fighting and the tanks decided to stop in the woods,” he said. “Believe me, they shelled the hell out of us.“All I can remember is getting a shell very near me, going up in the air and coming down and one of my friends putting a helmet over my face,” he said, speaking at the Royal Hospital Chelsea last month. His femur was broken in half and he was flown back to the UK on 17 June.“After I was discharged, I got my suit, I got my hat, and you’re outside the door saying: ‘What’s next?’”Chelsea pensioner Frank Mouqué, 94, was a corporal in the Royal Engineers who landed on Sword beach and whose job was to dispose of bombs on a stretch of land beyond the parapet next to the beach.“We approached Sword beach in a landing craft. We had all of our gear on our backs and a rubber ring around our stomach to help keep us afloat. Let’s face it, the landing was very gory. You didn’t have time to think, survival instinct kicked in,” he said in his account published on the Royal Hospital Chelsea’s website.“After reaching the beach, I ran up towards a parapet, and searched for mines. After 12 hours of being on the go we were exhausted and then had to dig a foxhole to sleep in. We had to dig six foot down and two foot wide.“I slept outside for the next year or so, we had no protection from the elements. We had an oversized gas cape to go over our clothes and all our gear. We rarely slept lying down. Each time we slept in a barn we were ravaged by fleas – so even that was no good.“It was a different time: I wasn’t a hero, I was a little cog in a big wheel. When you add all those little cogs together – then we became important. We all worked together towards peace.”Alan Gaudern was born on D-day in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. His father, William, a teacher, would never see him. Serving in Normandy with the Somerset Light Infantry, William was killed on 10 July 1944 at the age of 37. Alan – who has visited Normandy, in particular Hill 112 west of Caen, which his father fought to recapture, and Bayeux war cemetery, where he is buried – has retained his last letters written from the front.The letters, read by Alan, form part of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission’s Voices of Liberation audio archive. During the 75th anniversary commemorations at Portsmouth and Bayeux, there will be installations where the public can listen to many of those voices.William and his wife, Ethel, already had a daughter, Joyce, aged four, when Alan was born. “Alan William was born on 6 June at Harrogate hospital. Ethel and he are both doing well, from what I hear,” William wrote to family friends. “I haven’t see my son and heir yet, so you can guess how much I am looking forward to my next leave. When that will be, I don’t know.”But it was not to be. William’s last letter to Ethel was dated 18 June 1944. He was on the move, he said. “It is a lovely summer morning, so we should have as comfortable a trip as is possible. The countryside was perfect as we came along, so fresh and full of beauty,” he wrote.He enclosed a £5 cheque, sent to him at the front by his father. “Please cash it and spend it on yourself, on something you would really like. I shall look forward to hearing what it is, and later to seeing you wearing it,” he wrote.The letter continues: “You know we’ve faced up to the likelihood that I may not come back. But you know I feel I shall come back because I want to so much. We’ve had a perfect married life together, haven’t we?”He adds: “But if I don’t come back, I want you to know how much I owe to you and to thank you for our lovely life together. And to let you know that it isn’t my wish that you remain a widow if you really fall in love again. I am happy in the knowledge that you’ll bring up Joyce and Alan to be useful and good God-fearing citizens. If I don’t come back, teach them as much nature study as you know, which is a great deal.“I hope we can sit down one day and laugh at what I’ve written. Wish me a happy landings and be a brave lass like you always are. You’re not to worry or else the milk will go sour.”Alan, a retired bank manager, and himself a father, said: “My mother was both mother and father to me and I think she did a good job with that. Yes, I felt as I look back that I would have wished to have a father as a male role model, which is so important. But my mother was an amazing woman.“She was left with a four-year-old and a six-week-old baby to fend for herself. People now don’t realise how difficult it was for war widows. Yes, my mother got a war widow’s pension, but that was taxable. Taxable! For a war widow.”Three generations of William Moody’s family have worked for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) in France. As supervisor of the sector that takes in Normandy, Moody, 67, has a responsibility for ensuring the Bayeux military cemetery, the largest British second world war cemetery in France, looks perfect for the 75th anniversary.There are 4,144 Commonwealth burials there, each one marked with a white headstone. Maintenance is ongoing throughout the year. Each headstone is cleaned. The turf is fertilised and cropped short to maintain its vivid green. Seasonal plantings include roses, designed to bloom in June on the anniversary.“The headstone is the identity of the soldier, with his badge, and his name and his regiment. So it’s so important. You see old veterans, standing by the graves of perhaps a friend they lost. Sometimes they rest their hand on the headstone. This is their comrade, whom they lost in the landings. As I walk past, I keep very quiet, because they are honouring their comrades. They are here to see their friends. It’s very emotional,” said Moody.“And the plantings, to me, it is as if each one has their own little garden, like they might have done back home, if they had lived. I am proud to be able to honour those that fell and to give them a place that seems like home, although they are sometimes so far from home.“I feel as though I am passing the legacy of remembrance on to future generations, ensuring that we can always come to these remarkable places to reflect on the courage, sacrifice and the real cost in human terms that these men and women made to preserve our freedom.”Moody has worked for 52 years with the CWGC, starting as a pupil gardener. His father, who is from Aberystwyth in Wales, served with the Royal Signals, serving in India before coming to France after the Normandy landings and staying there to work for the CWGC in northern France.He has witnessed many anniversaries at Bayeux, and other CWGC cemeteries throughout Europe and north Africa. But it is the scale of the Bayeux commemorations he always finds so moving. “I am always amazed when I see the veterans go past marching. They try to keep straight, they are soldiers still, and the pride is there. They walk straight, and some of them have difficulties walking, but they still do it, they try to march, and its a huge effort for them, but they want to show the public they are still there,” he said.Col Jeremy Green (retired), is a historian and expert on Southwick House, the Allied HQ near Portsmouth, from where Gen “Ike” Eisenhower made the decision to delay by one day. Green said initially there were huge differences between American and British and Norwegian meteorologists. And had Ike, the supreme allied commander, listened to his fellow Americans, D-day could have been a disaster.“The Americans came here with great enthusiasm based upon an analogue system of taking the weather by a guy called Irving Krick. He basically said if you look at historical weather patterns, and if those conditions are replicated again, the same weather would occur,” said Green. “And the problem for us, the Brits, was he was briefing Eisenhower direct.”The American military initially refused to talk to the British chief meteorologist, James Stagg, “because he was a civilian”, until Stagg was temporarily made a group captain in the Royal Air Force.Stagg was receiving information from weather stations including, crucially, Blacksod Lighthouse in County Mayo, on Ireland’s west coast. A huge depression rapidly moving into the Channel did not augur well for 5 June, the original planned day of the Normandy invasion, thought Stagg. Krick thought 5 June was “good to go”.Ike was living on his nerves, “smoking five packs of cigarettes a day, drinking too much coffee, eating little and sleeping less,” said Green.With disagreements among the meteorologists, Stagg decided it fell to him to give an “unequivocal and firm opinion on the deterioration of the weather”. He told him 5 June would be overcast, stormy, with winds too strong to land troops, and cloud offering just 500ft-to-zero visibility.His words were greeted with silence, said Green.In the end, Eisenhower’s decision rested on Stagg’s opinion that there would be a brief “interlude” on 6 June. Eisenhower made his fateful decision. His diary records that on what should have been invasion day he awoke in the early hours to find “our little camp was shaking and shuddering under a wind of almost hurricane proportions and the accompanying rain seems to be travelling in horizontal streaks”.Stagg had been right. If the invasion had started that morning, it would have failed.Hours later, at the morning meeting, he announced his decision. Trusting Stagg, once more, the invasion was on for 6 June.Commander Craig Wood, of the Portsmouth flotilla, has responsibility for the naval homage to commemorate D-day in the UK.“This is an opportunity to commemorate our comrades who have gone before us, and to salute those who are still with us. And to recognise the phenomenal feat they embarked upon, which, I think, even after 30 years of service, is very difficult to even begin to imagine what that must have been like,” he said.Part of the Portsmouth flotilla’s role during the D-day event is to perform a salute to the 300 veterans aboard the Royal British Legion’s specially chartered MV Boudicca. “As the Boudicca sails with veterans to arrive in Normandy on 6 June, as they did 75 years ago, we are escorting her out, and further RN ships at sea will salute them as they go past,” he said.The frigate andsubmarine hunter HMS St Albans will escort the Boudicca and fire a salute to the veterans on board. The flotilla includes frigates and minehunters taking part in a sailpast in the Solent.“It’s been really heartening to see the young men and women of the armed forces coming together for this. Those same values and standards, the ethos of the armed forces 75 years ago and before, still resonate today,” he said.With the dwindling number of second world war veterans, many have predicted this will be the last such occasion to commemorate D-day.“Never say never,” said Wood. “The 70th anniversary was going to be the last event, and here we are five years later, And we still have a number of veterans. A naval historian once told me that history may not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme. And it is wonderful we can still engage with the veterans to remind ourselves about what they went through.“It’s humbling to see that spark in their eye as they recall what they did. Their humility is the thing that resonates with me. The ‘I was just doing my job, I played a very small part’. Not one of them would ever claim to be a hero of the day.”• This article was amended on 3 June 2019.

Even here in the UK we have a country that is ided on many fronts,” Mukwashi said.There was “a need for a collective healing”, she said. “As faith institutions, we have to be really bold and brave, and we need to bring all the tools, the skills that we have to try to help the world to heal. We can come up with economic solutions but when people are so hurt and ided, they need something extraordinary that touches the humanity in us. Nobody can stand on the sidelines, it’s a moral imperative.”Faith institutions had been “at the heart of horrific things in the past, but they have also been instrumental in the civil rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement, at the heart of providing education and healthcare services in developing countries”.Mohammed, who was appointed second in command at the UN in 2016, said faith leaders had to “get back to basics. Congregations will follow, but they’ll only follow a narrative that calls for core values of tolerance, peace, respect, dignity to be adhered to. This is not going to be an easy journey because we have fallen behind considerably.”But faith organisations had the potential to “break across silos”, she said, adding that countries were no longer just dealing with issues within their borders. She said leaders from different religions and different parts of the world needed to find common ground and work from there.Mohammed later told a meeting at Christian Aid’s London headquarters: “With a rise in xenophobic rhetoric, antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred, there is a growing global interest in engaging religious actors as peace mediators and as builders of inclusive and peaceful societies.“Time and time again, faith-based organisations have stood in the face of rising tensions and conflict. They have provided space for open and constructive dialogue.”Speaking to the , she acknowledged “legitimate” criticism of the UN as overly bureaucratic and top-heavy. “A lot of the time, with good intention, we thought we knew best – we prescribed a lot and didn’t listen enough. And we weren’t able to bring the resources on the scale needed to deal with the issues.”But she added: “There is a need for that space where all voices come together, 193 countries, to discuss challenges that can only be resolved in that kind of a space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd69ee6e5a2a31743fe30aa2bba00fa848d70c2/0_284_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be3e6ef2ebf9a44bc3ed1fbbeb09cd45","title":"gay rugby player kenneth macharia faces deportation to kenya as asylum claim rejected","story":"Kenneth Macharia fears he will be subjected to persecution and violence if forced to leave UKA gay rugby player who is facing deportation to Kenya, where he fears he will be subjected to persecution and violence because of his sexuality, has had a fresh claim for asylum rejected.Kenneth Macharia, whose plight prompted more than 100,000 people to sign a petition calling on the Home Office to halt his removal, has been told he must now leave the country “without delay”.The 39-year-old – who plays for Bristol Bisons, a gay and inclusive rugby club – says he is “feeling depressed” at the decision, which came as a big surprise, adding: “I am feeling hopeless at the moment.”A Home Office decision letter sent to Macharia’s solicitor acknowledged that gay sex in Kenya was punishable by up to 21 years in prison and that LGBT people have reportedly been subjected to harassment, blackmail and rape.However, the letter added: “Whilst same-sexual activity between men has been criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison this law is rarely applied and the objective evidence does not establish that LGBT persons are likely to be subjected to persecution or serious harm.”The Home Office’s decision comes days after Kenya’s high court last month upheld laws that criminalise gay sex in what was described by a campaigner as a “a sad day for the rule of law and human rights”.Macharia, who first claimed asylum in May 2016, arrived in the UK on a student visa in 2009. Macharia, a mechanical design engineer, has twice been granted extensions of his leave to remain, as a student and then as a highly skilled migrant.He has been through a legal appeals process, which has dragged on for several years. His initial claim for asylum was rejected in October 2016 so too was an appeal against the decision in December that year.After being granted permission to appeal to the upper tier, it was dismissed in August 2017. He was twice refused the right to appeal to the court of appeal in October 2017 and June 2018. Further submissions were refused in September and October 2018. Macharia, from Glastonbury, lodged new submissions in November and December which were the subject of the Home Office’s latest decision. A judge previously accepted that Macharia is gay but dismissed his claim that he would suffer persecution in Kenya.In its latest letter, the Home Office rejected Macharia’s concerns that he would be targeted because he was a “high-profile homosexual man” based on a string of news stories in the Kenyan press about his case, some of which prompted homophobic comments.Facebook comments seen by the  underneath a Kenyan news article about Macharia in November describe him as a “very bad example to the society in Kenya”. Another states: “We don’t need more demons here.”The Home Office letter said: “No evidence has been submitted to show that you will be singled out and persecuted by the authorities in Kenya as a result of your case being reported in the media.” The letter noted that homophobic comments were “very distasteful” but there were no direct threats to Macharia.In its decision, the Home Office also cited its own March 2017 document on “sexual orientation and gender identity” in Kenya, which noted that although “same-sex sexual activity between men is criminalised with a penalty of up to 21 years in prison … it is not clear if there have been any convictions”.It added: “Sources suggest that the law on ‘unnatural offences’ is rarely applied and there have only been two recent reported cases of its use, one of which was dismissed and the other still ongoing at the time of publication.”The Home Office document conceded that the police have arrested “some LGBT persons” but added: “This is usually followed by their release shortly afterwards.”The document also acknowledged: “The police have also reportedly harassed LGBT persons, or those believed to be so, and have subjected some to blackmail and rape. Public order laws have been used by the police as a means to arrest LGBT persons, especially those working in the sex industry.”But it added: “There have, however, also been some occasions where the police have protected LGBT persons against mob attack. In general the evidence available does not establish that LGBT persons are likely to be subject to persecution or serious harm by the state.”“It is also noted from the above objective evidence that effective state protection is likely to be available which you could access should you fear reprisals from mob justice or other people.”The document added that “there is nothing to show that you would be persecuted by the state as a result of your sexual orientation as a homosexual”.A Home Office spokesman said: “This government has a proud record of providing protection for asylum seekers fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.“All available evidence is carefully and sensitively considered in light of published country information. All decisions on claims based on sexual orientation are subject to an additional safeguard reviewed by a second experienced caseworker.”Macharia said he would consult his lawyer about his next steps."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Opening talks for restoring Assembly last 25 minutes\u0026lsquoHe needs to understand that ordinary, decent people are horrified by his world view\u0026rsquoDepartment to launch information campaign on new rules for Airbnb-style lettingsMary Noonan described as \u0026lsquofocal point\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquokeystone of family\u0026rsquoMan alleged to have been knocked unconscious, while another player urinated in pubLightweight boxing world champion flies home following Madison Square Garden victoryTwo men and an elderly woman die in separate crashes in Dublin, Kerry and TipperaryOncotype test reveals hormone therapy alone sufficient treatment for many womenPedestrian Gerard Whyte (21) was struck and killed by vehicle on the Swords Rd in DublinMartin says those who \u0026lsquotraffic in evil\u0026rsquo will no longer be able to exploit religious servicesThree teens died after being caught in a crush of hundreds queuing for a disco in CookstownIrishman released from National Rehabilitation Hospital to watch match with familyGroup co-operating with review into TD\u0026rsquos now-abandoned personal injury claimTwo men arrested after police respond to Sunday afternoon call about an assaultFamily obliged to pay for alternative flights, accommodation and travel costing \u0026euro1,500Revival group\u0026rsquos plans for Dublin main thoroughfare include 50 benches and illuminating the SpireNew figures reveal almost 65,000 women still waiting to receive smear test resultsCouncillor submits resignation from party over \u0026lsquointernal battle\u0026rsquoRhodes programme says no one has ever turned it down in favour of MitchellIFSC-headquartered developer predicts its US portfolio will grow to a total value of \u0026euro336m"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3913500.1559577171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"katie taylor to arrive back in dublin on tuesday morning","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKatie Taylor (centre) celebrates her win against Delfine Persoon in the IBF, WBC, WBO, WBA, Ring Magazine Women’s Lightweight World Championships fight at Madison Square Garden, New York.

A key irritation is that it has taken more than two years to formulate.“This has taken us longer to roll out our plan than I had originally thought it might — to put it lightly,” Mr Pompeo said. Other US officials have made similar complaints in recent weeks. Letters from Jerusalem RHSMr Kushner defended his plan in an interview with the Axios website but sparked controversy by questioning whether the Palestinians were capable of governing themselves and suggesting it didn’t matter if the Palestinians trusted him.  Asked whether the Palestinians were capable of governing themselves without Israeli interference, Mr Kushner said: “That’s a very good question. That’s one that we’ll have to see. The hope is that they, over time, will become capable of governing.”He also said “I’m not here to be trusted” when asked why the Palestinian leadership should trust him and other senior members of the peace team, who have longstanding links to the Israeli settlement movement. The Palestinians have said for months they will reject Mr Kushner’s because the US is not an honest broker. But the White House effort hit a new stumbling block this month after Israel unexpectedly called new elections in September. Mr Netanyahu failed to form a coalition before Wednesday\u0026#39s deadlineDonald Trump voiced frustration with the “ridiculous” new elections, which come just months after Israelis last voted in April. The elections threaten to further delay the peace plan and may lead to it being shelved altogether. “Israel is all messed up with their election,” Mr Trump said. “They ought to get their act together.”The US will move ahead with unveiling the economic half of its plan at a summit in Bahrain next month but it is not clear when, if ever, the White House will make public the more controversial political half of the plan. “We’ve long said that we will release the plan when the timing is right,” a US official said.Donald Trump visit: Queen welcomes President Trump at State BanquetComment: Why you should think twice before tweeting about Love Island contestantsFather \u0026#39punched shark in face five times\u0026#39 to save his daughterCanada complicit in \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39 of thousands of Indigenous women, national inquiry findsComment: Love Donald Trump or hate him, Britain is in some ways responsible for creating this president British soldier taking part in D-Day celebrations drowns in FranceDonald Trump\u0026#39s state visit prompts huge security operation as 1,000-strong entourage rolls into townDriver who killed ex-paratrooper with his car was \u0026#39county lines\u0026#39 drug dealer, court toldWild camping scheme suspended after critics brand it \u0026#39nonsense\u0026#39NHS bosses to recruit Mumsnet users in a bid to help fill nursing vacanciesCommon UK plant now close to extinction after \u0026#39farmers thought it was a weed\u0026#39 and sprayed it with pesticides, Kew Gardens sayComment: Tense tweets, gorgeous lawns and a wistful Simon Schama: taking in Trump\u0026#39s tour from the sofaDonald Trump\u0026#39s day in tweets -

Technical specialists come to the country to carry out repairs and maintenance of previously supplied machines. For instance, the maintenance of a batch of planes has recently been completed.Venezuela’s military operates an extensive selection of Russian hardware, and has been one of Moscow’s largest customers -- signing more than $10 billion (£7.9 billion) in contracts for equipment ranging from Kalashnikov to Sukhoi jets and missile systems.The sales have helped cement political ties between Caracas and Moscow. The arms trade is inherently political but Russia will generally sell arms to any nation that can afford them - in the past four years, however, Venezuela has struggled to meet its payment obligations.Moscow rakes in around $15bn annually from military exports to foreign nations and that money flows through Rostec, a massive state-owned holding company that has grown to control almost two-thirds of Russia’s defense industry.Russia’s arms industry deploys significant personnel abroad to manage its global empire. Some of these representatives work out of the Russian embassy on diplomatic passports.The vast majority of them are instructors or technicians who fly in to teach customers to operate and take care of their purchases. Then they leave if no further contracts are signed. Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan president, is backed by MoscowRostec has been moving its people out of Venezuela in the past four months after realising that the funds have dried up, the source said.According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Rostec’s withdrawal from Venezuela, the number peaked at 1000 but now stands at a few dozen.The ’s source could not specify exact numbers, but estimated Rostec’s peak presence could have reached 2000. Rostec’s pull-out does not show that Moscow has started to turn away from Caracas. In March, a contingent of 100 uniformed Russian troops flew to Venezuela.

Once you have fixed sites it’s not wild camping.”UK Wild Camp on Monday announced a “rethink” of the scheme, admitting that it had “inadvertently kicked over a hornet’s nest”.“We thought that running a booking scheme for entry-level wild campers, one that would provide them with the security and legitimacy that currently causes them concerns about camping wild, would be understood and welcome by the wider group,” it said. “We now see this is not the case!“With this is mind, we are going to suspend our service and have a rethink about how we might revise it. We won’t describe any future version of our service as ‘wild camping’ because for many of you that specifically means free and unplanned camping.Nor are we likely to stray into a debate around relaxing the laws on wild camping, because we now understand this is a highly charged area.”Donald Trump visit: Queen welcomes President Trump at State BanquetComment: Why you should think twice before tweeting about Love Island contestantsFather \u0026#39punched shark in face five times\u0026#39 to save his daughterCanada complicit in \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39 of thousands of Indigenous women, national inquiry findsComment: Love Donald Trump or hate him, Britain is in some ways responsible for creating this president British soldier taking part in D-Day celebrations drowns in FranceDonald Trump\u0026#39s state visit prompts huge security operation as 1,000-strong entourage rolls into townDriver who killed ex-paratrooper with his car was \u0026#39county lines\u0026#39 drug dealer, court toldNHS bosses to recruit Mumsnet users in a bid to help fill nursing vacanciesCommon UK plant now close to extinction after \u0026#39farmers thought it was a weed\u0026#39 and sprayed it with pesticides, Kew Gardens sayComment: Tense tweets, gorgeous lawns and a wistful Simon Schama: taking in Trump\u0026#39s tour from the sofaDonald Trump\u0026#39s day in tweets - from insulting the Mayor to meeting the QueenBlake\u0026#39s 7 and Doctor Who actor Paul Darrow dead at 78A dignified Donald Trump shows he has learned royal protocolComment: Only conviction politicians can survive in this personality-obsessed eraEverything we know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s state visit to BritainGerman mayor found shot dead in his gardenComment: The maths of a trade deal with Trump do not add upWorld\u0026#39s first gene-edited babies \u0026#39more likely\u0026#39 to die youngWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/14/15/office-stress-ball.jpg","title":"four day working week pay transparency yougov poll","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour Party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the Industrial Revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three-quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It may not be down to their university.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, the regulator for the higher education sector, told The Independent: “There are a number of avenues students can pursue if they are not satisfied with the quality of the teaching they receive or other aspects of their course.“It may well be that students raising concerns and complaints either informally or formally can bring about changes, but clearly it is important that students are able to escalate these concerns if a resolution cannot be found.”Last week, a government-commissioned review suggested that tuition fees should be cut to £7,500.An NUS spokesperson said: “The Augar\u0026nbspreview confirmed that fees are too high, and accepted that students are accruing unsustainable levels of debt within the current system. It is little surprise this affects their perception of value for money.“Students do have clear rights under law, and the report of the settlement does indicate a way students can seek recourse.”Last year, the County Court of Central London ruled in the university’s favour and ordered Ms Wong to pay £13,700 of Anglia Ruskin’s legal costs.\u0026nbspBut the university’s insurers wrote to the former student following the hearing, without reference to the university, offering to settle her £15,000 claim, plus the payment of her legal costs.A statement from Anglia Ruskin University said: “We do not support their decision and have informed them that we consider that they acted negligently and against the university’s interests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour Party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the Industrial Revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three-quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Apple said it had split the two apart to give the iPad new features to take advantage of its larger screen.They include the option to have two versions of the same app on the screen at the same time. That means users will be able to have two documents up to share between them, for instance.It also has special features designed for the Apple Pencil, which only works with Apple\u0027s tablet. There will be new ways of marking up documents with the pencil, and new gestures to navigate around.Created with Sketch.

But over that time it also became widely mocked for being slow and bloated, as Apple added more and more features.Now iTunes is dead, Apple has announced, and will be replaced by inidual apps for its various functions. It will instead have a music app, a podcast one and a TV app, it said.The Music app looks largely similar to the old iTunes app. But it removes all of the features that were not supporting music, instead focusing on songs, either stored locally or through Apple\u0027s own streaming service.Apple has been looking to encourage its users to sign up to its streaming services, which currently include Apple Music and will soon bring TV too.Created with Sketch.

Songs inside the app are unlikely to disappear, but it is unclear whether users will still be able to buy new ones.The company made the announcement while making a series of jokes, during which it poked fun at its history of adding a series of different features to iTunes and gradually making it more bloated and slow. Software head Craig Federighi suggested it would add a calendar and email clients to the app – before saying that the truth was they would be getting rid of the app entirely.All of the changes will come in the new version of\u0026nbspMacOS, named Catalina, which will be released later this year.The death of iTunes as one of the first things that Apple revealed about the new software, before it pointed to the entirely new and separate versions of the apps that will replace it.\u0026nbsp“With macOS Catalina, we’re bringing fresh new apps to the Mac, starting with new standalone versions of Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and the Apple TV app,” said Mr Federighi said in a statement. “Users will appreciate how they can expand their workspace with Sidecar, enabling new ways of interacting with Mac apps using iPad and Apple Pencil. And with new developer technologies, users will see more great third-party apps arrive on the Mac this fall.”Some had worried about how the Mac would continue to sync with iPhones or iPads without using iTunes. But Apple said that would be handled by MacOS itself, with options showing in the finder menu rather than in the iTunes app.Apple reveals new Mac Pro, its most powerful computer everThat will include other features such as the ability to use an iPad as a second display for your Mac.It also brings a new technology called Project Catalyst, which will allow developers to turn their iPad apps into Mac apps. It is not clear whether the new versions of Music, Podcasts and TV – which look similar to their equivalents on iOS –\u0026nbspwere written using these same technologies.Apple made the announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference, its biggest software event at the year. In the same presentation, it revealed a new Mac Pro, a redesigned version of iOS, and a new operating system specifically for the iPad.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only one couple will take home the cash prize.Among this year’s 12 hopefuls (though there will be many more) are a beauty therapist, a semi-pro rugby player, and a ballroom dancer. Also set to appear is 28-year-old pharmacist Anna Vakili, the first supposedly “plus-size”\u0026nbspcontestant. Twenty-one-year-old beauty therapist Amber Gill and 23-year-old scientist Yewande Biala are also amongst the women competing this year. As usual, Caroline Flack will take on presenting duties.Tommy Fury, the 22-year-old brother of boxer Tyson Fury, will join the line-up of male contestants, alongside the younger brother of Strictly Come Dancing star AJ Pritchard, Curtis.Follow our live blog for all the updates on tonight’s first episode as it happens.Meet the 12 contestants heading into the Love Island villaWhy it\u0027s time to stop hate-watching Love IslandThis year\u0027s Love Island has some big shoes to fill.\u0026nbspThe 2018 edition was the most popular programme in ITV2\u0027s history, with\u0026nbsp4.3 million people tuning\u0026nbspin to the final episode to root for Dani and Jack. (Don\u0027t tell us you wanted Megan and Wes to win.)A lot has been made, too, of the inclusion of Iranian Instagram star Anna Vikili,\u0026nbspwho has been dubbed, by some,\u0026nbspthe show\u0027s first plus-size contender. Actor and body image campaigner Jameela Jamil begs to differ. The producers of Love Island think this slim woman counts as their new token \u0027plus size\u0027 contestant? she tweeted. Are they drunk?This year\u0027s line-up is considerably more erse than it has been in previous years. When I was on Love Island, there was a lot about me being the only dark skinned girl, said last year\u0027s contestant Samira Mighty.

It will release it in autumn as well as a differently sized version that will be meant to be mounted in racks.Apple repeatedly bragged that the specifications inside the computer made it unprecedented and that it could be upgraded to include performance never before seen on a Mac.The previous version had not gone updated for five years, and Apple said it had made severe mistakes in the design of that computer that stopped it from releasing new updates. It had avoided those issues with a new design and a tremendously capable cooling system which includes an enormous fan, it said.As well as claiming the computer was its most powerful ever, Apple said it was its most configurable version, too. Apple will let people add a wide variety of different hardware to their computer, as well as the new display.During the reveal, Apple showed off how the new computer could easily deal with multiple streams of very high quality raw 8K footage. It also showed off how the computer could run Logic, its music composing and recording software, with hundreds of different tracks playing at once.It can also comes with wheels, so it can be pushed\u0026nbsparound on people\u0027s floors.Both the computer and its display have an unusual set of holes in the back, assembled in a lattice pattern, which it said will allow heat to leave more easily and achieve higher performance. Thermal problems had been central to the issues with the previous Mac Pro.The Pro Display XDR was revealed at the same time, and takes its name from the extreme dynamic range that Apple says it can show. It can be bought separately from the Mac, allowing it to be used with Apple\u0027s MacBooks, and includes a host of new technologies as well as a stand that allows it to swivel and attach to the wall.The display will cost $4999, which it claimed was cheaper than the other professional displays it was comparing it with. Like the computer, it will come out in the autumn.Apple revealed the new Mac Pro at its Worldwide Developers Conference, where it also showed off a host of brand new software updates.Created with Sketch.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.“If there’s interest, then that’s always a factor. If people are really psyched about it, I’d be psyched about it too. So we’ll see.”The band’s initial split in 1999 was mired in acrimony. During their final concert, at London’s Brixton Academy, Malkmus attached a pair of handcuffs to his microphone stand and told the audience: “These symbolise what it’s like being in a band all these years.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This would be a really, really big step backwards for us.”On the accumulation of meat on conveyor belts, Mr Spellman said: “Some of that poultry will be carrying campylobacter without a doubt, and some salmonella. The more contact they have with other bits of meat, the more contamination will spread.”And he added: “This practice of stacking the boxes up like that, with the bottom of the box on the chicken that’s underneath, makes it appear to be a comparatively innocent and harmless practice. It isn’t. It’s dangerous.”The real reason Trump is here is to carve up the NHSHere’s what Donald Trump has to say about BrexitNHS could be ‘on the table’ as part of US trade deal, ambassador saysTory MP becomes 13th candidate to enter leadership contestGove ‘prepared to delay Brexit until end of 2020 to block no-deal’For the programme, entitled ‘The Truth About Chlorinated Chicken’\u0026nbsprecruited an undercover reporter for a job at the plant in Texas, owned by Tyson Foods, America’s biggest poultry producer.She said: “On several occasions, I saw supervisors touching chicken with bare hands. The hygiene in the plant, it was just really kind of a shocker.”Criticism has grown that ministers will bow to US pressure to accept chlorine-washed chicken after Brexit, in their desperation for a trade deal with Washington.At the weekend, Woody Johnson, the US ambassador, made clear it would expect UK markets to be opened up to US agricultural products, in a trade deal already being “lined up”.“American products would come over. You give the British people a choice. If they like it they can buy it, if they don’t want it they don’t have to buy it,” he said.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Always apply sun cream when you’ll be in the sun. Don’t forget to wait  mins before venturing out. You can burn on a cloudy day too so wear sunscreen evenits not sunny. Reapply, reapply, reapply. You can burn in the UK too. Make sure youre using the correct SPFOver half Brits admitted they regularly miss areas of the body when applying sun protection.These are the areas that people are most likely to miss when applying sun cream, and how many of us dont apply sun cream to this area while outdoors.. Soles of the feet -  per cent. Bottom -  per cent. Hairline parting -  per cent. Lips -  per cent. Eyelids -  per centLauren Mackenzie, head of medical aesthetics at The Hospital Group, said: “Skin cancer is one of the biggest killers in the UK, so it’s quite shocking to see the risks Brits are taking when it comes to failing to protect their skin from sun damage.It seems from our research that most people are seriously underestimating the protection needed and aren’t giving sun cream application the appropriate time and attention.“Spending an extra five minutes applying sun cream and waiting for it to start working before jumping in the water on holiday are really simple changes to make, but will certainly save your skin in the long term.Practices like this can protect you from premature ageing and more serious damage that the sun can have on your body.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rev up leadership campaign","story":"Having kept a low profile for the past few days, he will unveil his most senior supporter yet, with Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, set to endorse him.The Boris campaign will also unveil a slew of MPs backing him, which will put him ahead in the endorsement stakes.But just as signicant as the number supporting him is the fact that Boris’s old enemies are beginning to make peace with him. I understand that ious MPs have been to see him to say that while they won’t vote for him, they would accept his leadership.One MP who won’t be endorsing him, though, is Amber Rudd. She and Boris sat down on Thursday. But ultimately the dferences between them over Brexit policy are too great to make any kind of dream ticket work.I understand that Rudd pushed the former Foreign Secretary to budge on his commitment that the UK would leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Johnson would not. Rudd felt that she could not support someone holding this position.Another complication was that Johnson and Rudd’s dferences on Brexit made it very hard for them to agree on a joint governing agenda. Johnson, though, should still have more votes in the first round than any other Brexiteer candidate.He needs to finish  votes clear of Dominic Raabhe is to establish himself as the clear Leave choice — Raab is more likely than him to pick up support as the second tier Brexiteer candidates drop out.As one of those backing Boris puts it: “He’s got to get as close as possible to a third on the first round.” The support of a third of MPs guarantees you a place in the members’ run-off.The problem for the former London Mayor, as this supporter acknowledges, is that “ there’s ever a perception that Boris was falling back then that would be compounded”.On the Cabinet side of the contest, Sajid Javid is attempting to reboot his campaign by today setting out his plan for how to deal with the Irish border issue.One of those backing him tells me it is “not just how you voted in the referendum, but your ability to implement no deal or negotiate with the EU” that matters. This supporter argues that Johnson and Raab aren’t going to get anything out of Brussels, while Javid might.The Cabinet side of the contest is becoming increasingly fractured. I understand that the Cabinet Ministers most opposed to No Deal have privately agreed to back either Matt Hancock or Rory Stewart in the first round. Both are running interesting campaigns.Stewart is out doing social media walkabouts, while Hancock is making arguments that the other candidates are being forced to follow. I’m told that next week he will propose a levy on betting companies to fund treatment for gambling addiction.The energy of these campaigns is causing trouble for the more established Cabinet contenders. I understand that backers of one of them are now warning MPs: “Go to bed with Hancock, wake up with Boris.”But Jeremy Hunt’s biggest problem is the sense that, in the words of one senior Tory, he is a “completely wasted place” in the final two as it is hard to see how he could beat a Brexiteer candidate.This is why a growing number of Tories think the party is “heading to the destined psycho-drama” of a Boris Gove run-off.BATTEN down the hatches, hurricane Donald is blowing into town. As his interview in this newspaper demonstrates, Donald Trump won’t be governed by the normal diplomatic conventions on his State visit.He is more than happy to make known his admiration for Boris Johnson, despite the Tory leadership contest. Though some of the rival camps think Trump’s blessing will be a double-edged sword.It is the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who will greet Trump on his arrival, which will give Hunt the chance to burnish his statesman credentials. Hunt will also be involved in Tuesday’s Downing Street talks between Trump and Mrs May.Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary, who is expected to throw her hat into the leadership ring, will meet with the President’s daughter, Ivanka, to discuss female economic empowerment.Trump is not an easy President to deal with. But he is the leader of our closest and most important security ally. UK politicians must also realise that on ious issues, including China and the role of Huawei in G networks, the Trump position represents the new political consensus in the US.The UK would be mad to endanger its most import- ant intelligence relationship over this issue.THE next test for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party comes on Thursday, with the Peterborough by-election.If Farage’s party can win, it will show how Brexit has redrawn the political landscape. It will give the Brexit Party a toe-hold in Parliament and a chance to become a formidable political force.Butthe Brexit Party can’t take a seat which voted heavily for Leave in the aftermath of its Labour MP being sent to prison, then its current momentum will be checked.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled. This is surprising given that it didn’t meet this week as Parliament was in recess. The official reason for it not taking place is that there is too much on with the Trump visit and D-Day commemorations.But as one minister points out to me, it is hard to believe that Cabinet would have been cancelledit hadn’t been for the fact that Theresa May is resigning as Tory party leader at the end of the week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is the Cabinet.It is not only Theresa May who let down Conservative Party voters, members and supporters.She was abetted and supported by her Cabinet. In this country we operate a system of collective responsibility and it is not good enough for Cabinet members now to claim they held a dferent view or would have done things dferently.How can it be right that Cabinet Ministers, who were complicit with the failed Brexit polices of Chequers, the Withdrawal Agreement and the subsequent betrayal of Brexit, credibly seek to claim they are an acceptable choice for this role They were sat around the top table when decisions were made and must take responsibility for them.I would sup with a very long spoon indeed with those who are complicit but now claiming they can offer the Party new leadership and direction.The British public are not stupid and our Party members know what they are voting for.They wont be fooled by those born-again ‘Leavers’, who trumpet their devotion to Brexit even though they have done nothing for the last three years to advance theof British sovereignty.The British public and our long suffering Party members know where the responsibility for the greatest breach of trust in our democratic institutions lies.After three years of being repeatedly told that ‘nothing has changed’, the time has come for ‘everything to change’.The British people are desperate for our country to leave the EU on st October. They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again. Our destiny is as a global beacon of free trade, not a satellite of the EU.The Conservative Party must quit the navel-gazing and stop the rot of this Brexit betrayal.Those of us who believe in our Country and people, who respect our democratic and political freedoms, will continue to stand up for our liberty to make sure the days of betrayal are over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership. We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.It’s not too late to take advantage of the opportunities we hoped for in voting Leave. It’s time to look forward we have an incredibly bright future ahead of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s just an absolute building site.”The couple are now demanding a refund after they were forced to move to another hotel in Torremolinos.Fuming Liam even accused TUI of doctoring photos of the hotel on its booking website to trick punters.The SuneoClub reopened last month after a refit.But TUI has admitted the construction work won’t be finished until next week.In a statement, TUI said: “We are really sorry some holidays have been affected by ongoing construction work.“This was due to be completed before customers arrived but due to unforeseen circumstances there was still signicant disruption.“We provided them with alternatives including moving to an alternative resort, receiving compensation or flying home.A small number of customers chose to fly home and will receive a full refund.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tv duo ant mcpartlin and dec donnelly open their own bank to fulfil their passion about finance","story":"Cameras went behind the scenes at the boys new HQ, where they claim the TV stuff was always just a gateway to their “real passion of banking.The pair say they have found a gap in the market because no one had really heard of banks before they did it, adding that the key to their success is not having keys.The bank of ‘Antandec’ was launched todayto mark a new multi-year partnership with Santander UK.Keith Moor, CMO at Santander said: “We are thrilled to have Ant and Dec on board at this very exciting time for Santander UK.“The concept behind the campaign and its speed to market is testament both to the power of a great idea and the synergy between the duo and the bank.We look forward to working closely with them over the years to come.”The Antandec campaign – a play on the name Santander – will focus on how Santander helps customers realise their aspirations, in a light-hearted and engaging way.It will utilise the bank’s comprehensive research into its customers to help bring to le the products and services that answer genuine customer needs, while using the comical bank of ‘Antandec’ and its somewhat less practical product solutions, as an amusing counterpoint.The campaign is set to run across digital display, video on demand, online video, cinema, TV, social, outdoor digital screens, radio and the bank’s owned channels, including its branches and the Santander UK website.Ant said: “We’re really excited to be partnering with Santander.They presented us with a really fun creative which we couldn’t resist, who would say no to having their own bank brought to le.“We really hope people love the campaign as much as we do and along with enjoying the humour can see how Santander can help people with whatever their banking needs may be.”In a Santander-first, the company’s workforce will be invited to join Ant and Dec and take on the role of brand ambassadors themselves, activating the campaign on social media before the first advert airs on TV.Santander staff and the public will be invited to access a dedicated microsite, where they will be able to watch a preview of the adverts and see behind-the-scenes footage, as well as share the campaign across their social media channels.The bank has worked with a number of high-profile British personalities since , including Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis and Formula  World Champion Jenson Button, both of who continue to act as brand ambassadors for the British bank."},{"url":null,"title":"ann widdecoombe gay homophobic science brexit party","story":"The new Brexit Party MEP has been labelled a relic after making the controversial remarks.She said: The fact that we think it is now quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesnt mean that science might not be able to produce an answer at some stage.Widdecombe has been labelled vile and accused of running a sick anti-LGBT campaign by Labours Luke Pollard.He tweeted: Utterly ashamed to be represented by this vile woman.

But instead of a ­successful preparation for D-Day, five tanks sank and six men perished.Albert, , who now lives in Solihull, West Mids, says: “I managed to get out when my tank started to go down but other men weren’t so lucky. We knew we had to do it again in Normandy so we put it behind us and focused on the task in hand.”Albert had joined the th th Royal ­Dragoon Guards in  and he says of June , : “When we set off I think all of us felt very proud, but none of us knew we’d be taking part in something that would go down in history.”After landing, Albert’s unit happened upon an enemy building in the distance and groups of retreating soldiers.“There were lots of German infantry marching away,” he recalls. “I remember how archaic their columns looked – there were no tanks or armoured vehicles.“There were horses pulling things and what looked like ­furniture vans. We fired upon them and while I didn’t care about the German loss of le, the horses being killed really stuck with me.” But Albert’s D-Day ended after a skirmish with the th Panzer ision on day two.He says: “I had my head on the tank telescope. I heard a loud blast and someone shouting, ‘We’ve been hit’. It was like a sheet of red came across my entire face.”With blood pouring from a head wound sustained from the telescope, Albert fled out of the tank.Read the remarkable stories of the ing veterans from our superb souvenir pullout:He says: “There was machine gun fire all around us.

It’s unacceptable how these people are living.”The house is let by a private landlord and run by a manager who claims she rented it to a family-of-eight.

I feel like blowing my stack. I am so angry,” she says, after one of the squatters, a scruffy, unkempt, overweight middle-aged man boasts that they’ve been putting the rubbish out for her.

I’m extremely thankful to have a dad who thought girls could hunt too.“As a little kid, I knew it simply as a way of putting food on the table we didnt buy beef, we always had deer meat. As I got older, I saw it as a way to escape the outside world and relax.“I love everything about hunting, but Ive always loved being outdoors. Its peaceful and I see so many things in the woods that others never get to see.“Im also providing food for myself and family. Lastly, money from my hunting licence goes towards funding conservation.“Most recently I hunted turkey here in Ohio you can only hunt when its daylight, but I get up extremely early so Im there before daylight and the turkeys dont see me walking into the woods.“I will try to locate turkeys by listening for gobbles, and then call them in with a turkey call. You can only hunt male turkey, so the calls imitate females as spring is breeding season.“Although Im not sure its a hunt I did shoot a few rabbits in the backyard and took my daughter with me. Her first official hunt was youth turkey season when I took my friend and her daughter turkey hunting.“We had to be there before daylight, so I got my daughter up early, fed her and drove to the spot we were hunting.“We had a ground blindset up to sit in and wait. She did extremely well for an eight-months old baby and was very quiet the whole time, for five hours.“Everything I shoot is eaten or made into something. Furs, antlers, feathers, skulls - I try to use as much as possible and I think thats important.“As far as what I use the animal parts for I make them into home décor, clothing, wall mounts, blankets, anything useful that I can think of.”Rebekah says that while she has received some negative comments from strangers, since they don’t know her personally, they cannot judge.She hopes that her daughter will pick up her hobby in the future.“I use a bow and arrow for everything I hunt the biggest hunt was a whitetail deer I think my biggest buck was over fourteen-stone four pounds,” she said.“It is hard sometimes to have patience to wait for animals you dont always see something to shoot and can go weeks without shooting something.“Some people love it, yet others think it is too extreme and dangerous. Some have even wished ill on my le for taking my daughter hunting.“I get quite a few anti-hunters saying things like, ‘how would you like itsomeone hunted you and your baby’ and other things along the lines of, ‘how can you teach an innocent baby such horrible things like hunting ’“I try not to let it bother me it can be tough at times, but strangers online dont know me so really cannot judge me.“Hands down the best comment was from someone who lets me hunt in their property. He said that he thought it was great that I was getting my daughter involved in the outdoors at such a young age and that it was great that I hadnt stopped doing what I was passionate about just because I had a child.“I hope that she loves to hunt and fish as I do she already adores the outdoors. However,she chooses not to hunt and fish, I will respect her decision.“There is always much respect in taking a le.

A friend arriving from across the Atlantic wouldn’t try to dictate the really special relationship with the rest of Europe. And a friend landing from across the Atlantic wouldn’t try to get his dirty, money-grabbing tiny mitts on our National Health Service. In promoting charlatan Boris Johnson and hoaxer Nigel Farage while his London ambassador demands the NHS as a prize in any trade deal, Trump has unmasked himself as a foe.    The Queen would be wise to sup with a long spoon when forced to host creepy Trump and his freeloading clan at tonight’s ­Buckingham Palace state banquet. Inhabiting his make-believe weird world, Trump fibs he’s loved in Britain – a notion destroyed by the absence of the ­traditional horse-drawn gilded coach ride along the Mall. No band could play louder than the boos of tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of ­thousands, demonstrating against a rogue who pollsters say we dislike by three to one. Trump’s trumpeting of ­Johnson is no surprise when the tyrannical President hates decent politicians and showers praise on the world’s most unsavoury, from Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman to Jair Bolsonaro, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Rodrigo Duterte.    The congenital liar and serial liar are natural ­bedfellows. Trump mini-me Johnson is happy to cuddle for a pat on the head from an orange man-baby he once labelled “out of his mind”, whose “stupefing ignorance” meant he was “unfit” to be President. John McDonnell, one of Labour’s sharpest strategists, is reminded of TV’s Spitting Image in the s by the Tory leadership charade. “These modern-day Spitting Image characters are stuck trotting out the same old Thatcherite answers in ,” mused McDonnell.

A hearing at Burnley Magistrates’ Court heard that the -year-old had sent messages and letters expressing his worries about a tax credit issue and his own depression to his loved ones prior to going missing. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of his death as drowning. The inquest heard from detective inspector Tim Brown who said belongings were left at the waterside including a note wrapped in plastic.    He said: “There were no apparent injuries or suspicion of violence or third party involvement. “We had information from family members that notes had been left by him.” Mr Jeffrey’s son, Alex, told the court he had seen his father the night before and there was ‘nothing unusual about the evening’, but that after taking a phone call his father was ‘quiet and distracted’.

Local sightings of the moon can dfer, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days dferent countries start and end their fast. Sightings have now been made in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, where Islamaposs holiest mosque is. Eid is celebrated by family and friends getting together and many will also attend special Eid prayers in the morning. It is traditional for people to wear new clothes, in particular children, and for loved ones and neighbours to visit each other to exchange good wishes. The most common greeting to say to Muslims is Eid Mubarak.    Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle. When it starts is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month. If the new moonis spotted, fasting begins the following day.  Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan ,the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete and Eid is celebrated the following day.    Ramadan moves about  days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year. The month can last either  or  days. This year it began on Monday May  and is ending at sunset tonight.  During the holy month, Muslims do not eat or drink each day during daylight hours, but can feast once the sun has gone down. Fasting  , or apossawmapos as itaposs known in Arabic, is one of the five pillars of Islam and a very spiritual time for Muslims all around the world. Itaposs not only about fasting, but also about dedicating time to religion. Muslims use this month to try and re-focus their attention on being calm, patient, kind and to give to charity. Families and friends break the fast together every day with a big meal known as apostarapos. Tonightaposs tar will be extra special as it will be the last - until next year.

Photos show the self-tanner with her normal pale complexion contrasted by her dark orange tanned hand and a fake-tan shadow under her chin.    Lucy claims she used the aposwrong side of the tanning mittapos and the resulting patchy coverage also left white streaks on her chest, armpits, legs and left her feet two dferent colours. After sharing the photos online, pals were convinced that the orange hand on Lucyaposs mouth belonged to someone  - and were in hysterics when they realised the error. Lucy claims that the result was so aposdiabolicalapos sheaposll never self-tan again. Lucy, from Aberdare in Wales, said: It looks absolutely vile. When my mother saw me she just went aposwhat the f*** have you done apos. My legs turned out really well but my hands made people make comments like, aposI thought someone  was grabbing youapos. They were like aposI thought you were being kidnapped, you couldaposve got away with thatapos.    My neck made it look like I had a beard because I had only done the tan up to a certain point on my face. It was just shocking. Iaposve learned my lesson. My nails have gone a funny colour from the tan. Where I had nails on I have strips of brown through my nails. I would dieanyone thought it was dirt. I donapost think Iaposll tan again. I think Iaposll have a spray tan from now on. I donapost want to risk it. Iaposm just going to let an expert do it next time. Iaposve scrubbed, Iaposve itched and everything, Iaposve used a skin peeler and it didnapost work. She claims it was the first time she had used fake tan in seven years and had previously always used tan wipes to achieve her golden glow. Lucy, who also works at McDonaldaposs, said: I wanted a fake tan because I was going to a really posh event. Iaposm really not posh, so I was like Iaposll have a tan, Iaposll look really skinny with my tan. So I was chucking the layers on, it wasnapost making much dference so I thought Iaposd keep going.    My hands just werenapost taking it so I pumped about six pumps [of the mousse] and literally lathered my hands with it. I just cried the next morning. I wanted to cry. Compared to the rest of my body it was diabolical. The event was really posh. They were drinking their champagne while I was drinking my WKD. I wanted to look all smart. But I didnapost look smart, not with the bad hands and bad ankles. I had to use a darker foundation, but it didnapost look too bad. My body felt orange but my face was the only pale thing about me to be honest.

Judge Mark Everall said Johnathan Patrick Terry, who is in his s and has links to a hair products business with a base in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, has defied orders to pay maintenance to the woman, in her early s,. The woman had made a cash claim following the breakdown of a relationship with Mr Terry, who is commonly known as Patrick Terry, which spanned about  months. She wanted maintenance for herself and their eight-month-old daughter. But the judge said Mr Terry, who left the woman a few days before their daughter was born, had not engaged in the proceedings.    The judge has been analysing evidence at private hearings in the Central Family Court in London. But he has decided that there is now a public interest in allowing journalists to report the case and name Mr Terry. He has outlined detail in a ruling delivered after the latest hearing on Friday. Lawyers representing the woman asked the judge to partially lt the anonymity veil. Barrister William Tyzack and solicitor Alistair Myles, who is based at law firm Levison Meltzer Pigott, said the woman thought that letting journalists name Mr Terry, and publish his photograph, might encourage him to pay up. Judge Everall has given his approval but said neither the woman nor the girl can be named in reports.    The judge said the woman is now caring for the baby in her motheraposs housing association flat, and living on state benefits totalling around £ a month, and said there is evidence that Mr Terry has fathered  other children. He has approved the womanaposs claim for about £, a month in maintenance, for her and the girl, and a lump sum payment of about £, to cover rent payments and to buy furniture. The judge said she was making reasonable claims and said evidence suggested that Mr Terry was wealthy and could easily afford what she wanted. He said evidence indicated that Mr Terry had financed a lavish lestyle when they were together. Judge Everall said earlier this year he had ordered Mr Terry to pay interim maintenance, pending the completion of litigation. He said Mr Terry had not paid and was about £, in arrears. The judge said: It is plain that the father has not engaged, and has no intention of engaging, in these proceedings. The mother fears, and with some justication, that the father will take steps to avoid paying. Meanwhile the mother and this young child are being supported by the State. Companies House records show that Mr Terry has had an address in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, and involvement in a hair products firm called Her Imports. Mr Terry could not be reached for comment.

Simonne Kerr, , was allegedly attacked by former solider Desmond Sylva who is accused of later calling  to say Iaposve just committed a murder, the Old Bailey heard. Sylva, who served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Iraq and Kosovo, had been admitted to hospital with suicidal thoughts and threatened to kill himself or someone  the night before, jurors were told. The -year-old Jamaica-born defendant has admitted manslaughter but denies murder, claiming his depression impaired his mental . However, the prosecution allege that he attacked the Guyaposs and St Thomasapos nurse simply because he lost his temper.  The mum, who worked as a nurse at Guyaposs and St Thomasapos Hospital, appeared on the talent show as part of an NHS choir called B Positive. She joined the choir after her son Kavele died in  after suffering with sickle cell anaemia. Opening his trial, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC said Ms Kerr was last seen leaving the hospital where she worked on August  last year, heading to Sylvaaposs flat in Clapham, south London. At lunchtime that day, Sylva telephoned his brother to say he had just murdered his girlfriend before alerting emergency services, the jury was told. In a  call played in court, Sylva allegedly said: Can I have police please  Iaposve just committed a murder. Iaposm ex-Army and Iaposve got lots of mental health issues. Asked why he had done it, he allegedly said: Sheaposs just get on my nerves, man, trying to fight me and take my money so I had to defend myself . Police found Ms Kerraposs body wrapped in a blood-soaked duvet, suggesting she had been attacked while lying in bed, jurors heard. Mr Glasgow said: Her throat had been slashed and she had been repeatedly stabbed to the right side of her face and her neck.  Desmond Sylva had used a kitchen kne to inflict more than  wounds to her body and, despite her efforts to fight him off, she was clearly powerless to do so. Afterwards, the defendant initially told police he had acted in self-defence during an argument and claimed to have partial amnesia. But Mr Glasgow said: What is obvious is that Simonne Kerr did not stand a chance. The last few minutes of her le must have been utterly terrying: repeatedly stabbed by the man who was supposed to care for her but who in the end simply butchered her and then tried to blame her for what he had done. The question that you will have to determine is why he did what he did. He chose to pick up a kne and he chose to use it again and again to stab Simonne Kerr at a time when he was not acting in lawful self-defence and did not need to defend himself from her. His depression neither explains nor justies his actions and what happened was that his anger got the better of him and he simply lost his temper. Sylva completed two tours in Iraq and one in Kosovo before being discharged from the Army on medical grounds.  Since then he has been given treatment on a number of occasions and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, jurors heard. By the time of the killing, he was working as a security guard in Canary Wharf and had been prescribed medication for his depression. Sylvaaposs family knew about his struggle with depression and he was briefly admitted to Cha and Westminster Hospital after telling his mother he was feeling suicidal on August  last year. The day before the killing, the defendant allegedly told his brother, Damian Sylva, that he was going to kill himself or someone . After speaking for a long time, Sylva appeared to calm down and said he was getting ready for work, the court was told. When Sylva called his brother to say he had murdered his girlfriend the next day, it was the last thing he expected to hear, Mr Glasgow said. Giving evidence, Mr Sylva, a serving Army Signalman, said he kept in regular contact with his older sibling, whose hobbies included DJ-ing and working out at the gym.  Describing their call on August , Mr Sylva, , said: He was saying to me that he felt like he was going to kill himself or someone. I thought this is not you, why are you speaking like this  On their contact the next day, the witness told jurors: He said to me aposI think I have just killed my girlfriend. Take care of my stuff and I will see you in the next leapos. I was in shock. I could not believe what I heard. I said, aposare you serious apos He said aposYes, I murdered my girlfriend. Iaposve called the policeapos. I did not want to believe it was happening but I knew I had to do something, call the authorities, regardless of whether I believed it or not. Mr Sylva also revealed that before joining the Army his brother, then aged , had stabbed himself in the neck. His brother was based in Germany awaiting deployment to Afghanistan when his marriage ended, leaving him heartbroken and worried about contact with his daughter. In , while the witness was in Afghanistan, Sylva assaulted their mother, jurors heard. Mr Sylva said the reason why his brother was admitted to hospital was because he had taken an overdose. The Old Bailey trial is expected to go on for up to  days.

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall greeted the US president and his we Melania ten months after Charles is said to have “deliberately snubbed” the politician, who once bragged that he could have bedded Princess Diana. Leading body language expert Judi James gives her verdict on how the men interacted, saying Charles displayed self-comfort anxiety rituals. She writes: Was there any extra tension behind the scenes at Buckingham Palace during Donald Trump’s visit Prince Charlesaposs body language signals suggested there was.  The Prince of Walesapos signature self-comfort anxiety rituals appeared to have increased as he emerged from the palace to greet Trump on the lawn outside. He patted his pockets stuffed one hand inside his left pocket several times fiddled with his cuffs and ended employing a hand-wring as he stood waiting, suggesting high levels of agitation. He received Trump with a warm smile though, finding himself on the receiving end of a very prolonged, bent-arm handshake ritual that included eight or nine hand-judders and even a pat on the arm add-on gesture from Trump, who was clearly trying to show bloke-ish friendship and good humour.    There was some rather awkward rituals of herding and ushering after that, with Trump using one hand to usher Charles to walk in front, which led to Charles throwing both arms out to his sides to counter-herd Trump in front of him like a shepherd with his flock. Trump adopted an air of happy dignity, using a mouth-clamp and raised chin plus a very upright walk, although he broke into a smile of pleasure as he walked up to greet the Queen. Trump claimed he could have bedded DianaBy Chris KitchingBusiness mogul-turned-politician Donald Trump, now , is known for making dubious claims and inappropriate comments about women in his decades in the spotlight.  He made some tasteless remarks about Princess Diana, , shortly before her death in a car crash in Paris . Then a real estate magnate, Trump, speaking to radio shock jock Howard Stern, bragged that he could have bedded the Princess of Wales. Trump - who recently called Prince Harryaposs we, Meghan Markle, nasty - agreed he could have nailed the mother-of-two in a shocking interview. Stern asked: You could’ve gotten her, right  You could’ve nailed her.  Trump agreed, saying: I think I could have. He added: “She was actually really beautul. I thought she was supermodel beautul. She had times when she didn’t look great and she had times when she looked better than anyone in the world. It is said that both Charles and Prince William deliberately snubbed Trump when he visited the UK in July last year. In , Trump told the New York Times that Charles and Diana - then still married - would be joining his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.  It was an effort to boost his business, but it was fake news. Buckingham Palace responded to the report and called the claims rubbish. The palace was also forced to rubbish claims that Diana wanted an apartment in Trump Tower in New York. More recently, the Prince of Wales, , and Trump are at odds over climate change. Charles, the heir to the throne, is a champion of the environment who has launched a number of conservation initiatives over the years. Trump has called climate change a Chinese hoax, bulls**t and a con job in the past, he wants to pull the US out of the Paris Accord, and many of his policies have been condemned by environmentalists. In January , two years before he was sworn in, Trump tweeted: This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bulls**t has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice.

While both Donald and Melania graced these shored with their presence last year, this is in fact Trumpaposs first official state visit .While weaposll probably never know what the Queen makes of the th US president, she has developed her own subtle, shady ways of communicating her feelings over the years. Last year, her choice of brooches during the Trumpsapos first visit sparked delight with their hidden messages .Whataposs important to realise is that the Queen knows how watched and visible she is, and that no aspect of her public appearances are left to chance - everything is deliberated over carefully.So it may be that sheaposs gone and made a VERY subtle dig at Trump once again, news.au reports. This time, however, sheaposs decided against using the power of jewellery. Royal watchers might have picked up on the fact that the Queen chose not to greet Donald and Melania as they arrived at Buckingham Palace on  US helicopter Marine One. Instead, it was Prince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall who had the pleasure of doing this. They were then tasked with bringing Trump across the lawn and up the stairs to meet the Queen.  As royal welcomes go, this is in stark contrast to the one shown to Barack and Michelle Obama back in . On that visit, both the Queen and Prince Philip met the then President and First Lady from their helicopter in Windsor. Of course, the Queen is increasingly handing over more and more responsibility to her eldest son. Then again, sheaposs also an expert in communicating her feelings in wily, unexpected ways.

The President and his we Melania will be guests of honour at the swanky celebration, which will be filled with tradition, protocol and some very, very fancy food. But thereaposs a lot more to a State Banquet than just sitting down for dinner. Months of preparation go into the lavish affairs and everything from the food to the guestlist is thoroughly planned. The whole thing only lasts an hour and  minutes, but there are lot of things President President Trump and his we will have lots of rules to remember.  The table A team of three people spend EIGHT weeks unpacking all George IVaposs Grand Service, dismantling, washing, polishing and putting it back together again. Setting up the room itself starts about five days before the event and a dedicated team spends hours making sure everything is just perfect. All the napkins are embroidered with the Queenaposs monogram, and are folded by one person so they are all exactly the same.   Each guests has six glasses for champagne, white and red wine, dessert wine, port and water. There are , bits of cutlery on the table for  guests. A member of the team measures each of the place settings to make sure every piece of cutlery, glass and decoration is in exactly the right place - to the millimetre. Once all the decorations have been added, the Queen does a final inspection to check everything is perfect. The food Chefs in the Palace kitchen start preparing the food as late as possible to ensure it is all fresh. Everything is handmade from scratch.  There are four course - fish, meat, pudding and then dessert . The menu changes for every occasion, but the dishes served up as just as fancy as you would expect. For King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maximaaposs visit last year, the kitchen served up meat pies and chocolate orange torte. The guests When guests arrive they will be shown into one of the state rooms before being personally presented to the Queen. They must remember not to touch the Queen at any point. Michelle Obama raised eyebrows when she put her arm around the Queen during a visit to the Palace.   They are then led into the banquet room where they have to check the seating plan and find their seats. Guests must then stand at their place until the Queen comes into the room. Once she takes her seat, everyone  can sit down. During the first course, the Queen will chat to the guest on her right. On the second course, she will switch to the guest on her left. This means President Trump will have to make sure he doesnapost chat to her when itaposs not his turn.

Gauteng Health, which is responsible for the hospital , has launched an investigation into the incident.A nurse, security guard and two doctors accused of being involved in restraining Mrs Marais have been put on special leave by the organisation.   Gauteng health executive council member Bandile Masuku told The Times : We have done our preliminary investigation and we have received reports.The reports have revealed four iniduals who were involved and who are on special leave pending their suspension. The report, according to Mr Masuku, identied a number of challenges regarding how Marais was treated as well as capacity issues relating to management and infrastructure. The family of Mrs Marais was visited by Mr Masuku on Sunday after the footage went viral. According to Gauteng health the hospital staff involved were served with letters asking for representations on why they should not be suspended. Mr Masuku said: After that we will be entering into a full-blown investigation, which will be independent. We welcome the involvement of the Human Rights Commission to do their own investigation which will hopefully correlate what we find. We have done a preliminary redress with the family… we are going to continue to give psychological and social support to the family because it is traumatic and something that should not be done to a human being, especially people who come to our facilities for help. He said that the hospital is committed to making sure it changes things around for its people in Gauteng, and helping staff members with the dficulties they face. He added that staff work very hard and he thinks they feel that the department doesnapost appreciate those who are putting in extra effort.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who ran another man","story":"NewsWoman who ran off with another man days after £k Mexican wedding gives birthMeaghan Mitchell cheated on husband Andy just days into their wedding but the couple have since reconciledShareCommentsByLiam Ross:,  JUN NewsMeaghan and Andy Mitchell tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in Cancun a year ago today - but soon hit rocky waters \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman dubbed the fajita cheater after she ran off with another man following her £, Mexican wedding has given birth to her husbandaposs baby.

Racheal Acuff went into septic shock from pneumonia that she didnapost even know she had. The -year-old drove herself to hospital after noticing blood in her urine which indicated a kidney infection. But when she arrived her health quickly deteriorated within the space of  hours.    Doctors tried to take the mum-of-twoaposs blood pressure , but it was almost too low to register at   and Racheal was quickly moved into a room on her own where they started to run tests before being moved to another unit. This is the last thing Racheal remembers as she was then sedated for three weeks. During this time, Rachealaposs family were called into the hospital to say their final goodbyes, which she could hear but not respond to due to the sedation. Doctors expected the worst, but to their surprise Racheal, from Missouri in the USA, came round weeks later. She was shocked when her mum told her that she had suffered septic shock from pneumonia which she had no symptoms of before other than tiredness and a kidney infection.  Racheal also had disseminated intravascular coagulation , a blood clotting disorder common in sepsis patients, toxic shock syndromefrom an unknown source and her kidneys were not working so she was put on dialysis. She was put on a ventilator to aid her breathing, had a feeding tube and IVs for her antibiotics to fight the infection and for a blood transfusion. After hearing her family say their last goodbyes to her, Racheal decided that she was not ready to die and made it her mission to get better for herself and her boyfriend,Taylor, , and daughters, Eden, , and Reagan, nine.    Racheal was in an intensive care unit for  days before being moved to a step down unit for a further eight days and spending two-weeks at an inpatient rehabilitation facility where she learnt to walk again and she went home in August. Since ing home, Racheal has had surgeries to amputate her fingers, toes and hand which were left damaged from her illness. She said: I went into septic shock on June , , from pneumonia and a kidney infection. I had no symptoms of pneumonia and I only knew of the kidney infection when I peed blood. I drove myself to the hospital as my boyfriend was currently in the same hospital with gallbladder issues.  Once I got to the hospital everything started happening really fast after they took my blood pressure which was so low it almost didnapost register. They moved me to a room right away and began running a list of tests. The last thing I remember was being told they were moving me upstairs and then I was sedated for three weeks. When I woke up my mum explained to me that I had septic shock, DIC and toxic shock syndrome from an unknown source. I was on a ventilator which was helping me breath, a feeding tube for all my nutrients, a port-a-cath for my dialysis because my kidneys were no longer working and two IVs for access for blood and to give me all my meds. I remember hearing my family cry when the doctors told them to bring in family to say their last goodbyes, but I was sedated and had no way to respond to them.  I felt totally helpless but I knew I had to fight to prove them wrong. I didnapost feel like I was dying, and I wasnapost going to. When I first woke up, I was totally surprised, and then I went into fight mode. I began to fight harder every day to get better. The doctors knew right away based on my blood work that I was septic and knew exactly what was wrong and treated me instantly with four antibiotics in the intensive care unit for  days. I was then moved to step down for an additional eight days for a total of  days in the hospital. I was then moved to an inpatient rehab facility for additional two weeks to learn to walk again and after almost nine weeks of medical attention I went home. Once home Rachealaposs sepsis ordeal still wasnapost over as her extremities were damaged due to the lack of blood flow whilst she was ill. On August  , she had the dead parts of four of her fingers on her left hand removed followed by the removal of the dead tissue on all five fingers on her right hand on September   and the amputation of all  of her toes on September  . Racheal had revision surgery to remove the little finger on her right hand on March ,  and on May   had a trans-radial amputation of her right hand two inches above the wrist. Recovering from her toe surgeries was the most harrowing for Racheal as it took her three weeks to walk again due to pain and she is learning to adapt to le without her right hand and is looking forward to getting a prosthetic in a few weeksapos time. Since I came home in August of last year I have had three surgeries on my hands, two to amputate my fingers that had lost blood flow during my illness and died, and my most recent, the amputation of my right hand due to its lack of mobility and , said Racheal.  The recovery process of sepsis was long and discouraging but in the end it gave me strength I didnapost know I had. The recovery of each surgery was dferent with my foot surgery being the worst, I couldnapost walk on them for three weeks and it was very painful. My most recent hand amputation has been dficult in that I lost a whole hand, lucky for me Iaposm left-handed and they took my right but itaposs still dferent. Iaposm starting to adapt until I get my new hand in a few weeks. I have grown so much through this process in myself and in my faith in God. There is no medical reason I should be alive. So, something more powerful is in my corner for sure. I soak up every moment good and bad and never take le for granted. Itaposs such a special gt youaposve been given so live it well, because youaposll never know when it could be taken away from you, and when itaposs real bad remember, itaposs just a bad day not a bad le.

This might be, for example, when someone wants her to include footage of her feet or to carry out a request somewhere public.   She told MailOnline that she began this enterprise to help pay for her studies as she needed a safety net.As for the sort of requests she gets, she revealed: I had a request where this guy wanted me to sneeze and go to the toilet in a public bathroom because of the privacy, echo and the clinicalness where people would be unaware. After carrying out the instruction at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds, she got a £ Urban Outfitters voucher for her efforts.

She added that she often found the art world to be elitist and inaccessible to people from low income backgrounds. Among her fans is one man who told her he watches [her] on [his] -inch TV in surround sound. With some help from a clothing tag and her allergy to bright lights, Abi can rack up  sneezes in one go, ad points out sheaposs only ever had two nosebleeds.    Abi got started on creating videos for fetishists after creating a piece called drawing of the form, endurance and repetition. For this, she had sneezed  times in three hours and had drawn an outline in pen. Having filmed her work and uploaded it to YouTube, the number of views quickly mounted to the thousands and the requests started to come in. She realised there was money to be made from these sort of clips. She admitted she would have dropped out of Leeds art school without the cash because her waitressing job at the Hepworth Gallery pays minimum wage.

Lying in the foetal position, the adolescent - whose gender has not been confirmed - took the game called Shagai or Knucklebones to the aposafterleapos. The amazing discovery was made in a necropolis in the Astrakhan region of Russia close to the Caspian Sea. Next to the skeleton was a game set comprising the ankle bones of animals possibly sheep or goats. The ancient game - popular in ancient Central Asia and called Shagai or Alchiki, and also known as Knucklebones or Jacks in English - was used to tell the fortune of players.  Some believe such bones were the first form of dice. A clay pot found resting on the face of the skeleton is not believed to be connected to the game. The teenager discovered in the Bogomolnye Peski burial ground is believed to be between , and , years old. Remarkable video and pictures show the ancient adolescent lying next to the game. Astrakhan History museum’s scientic researcher Georgy Stukalov said the skeleton lay in a “crooked position”.  The game “was probably the most popular among the kids in the Bronze age”. “And this game - Shagai - came to us through the centuries. “Even  to  years ago our granddads and grannies used to play this game.” It remains in Mongolia and some Central Asian states. Depending on the angle the bone lands in more modern versions, players may ine their luck.    The two convex sides represent a horse or sheep - seen as lucky - while the concave faces signy a goat or camel and are held to be unlucky. The grave is from the ancient Srubnaya culture, according to archeologists. In the same necropolis near the village of Nikolskoye, finds were recently announced of a “laughing” prehistoric man with an articially deformed egg-shaped skull, and a , year old nomadic ‘royal’ in a tomb with stunning gold and silver treasures. Unlike the teenager - whose burial was older - these relics came from the Sarmatian nomadic tribe which held sway in the region until the th century AD.

The man who was watching his side lose had been swearing at the assistant referees and throwing missiles from the stands throughout the game, according to reports. He then ran onto the field in the nd minute and jabbed his finger at the linesman as he berated him.    He also shoved him in the chest during the heated exchange in Itumbiara, Goiás. The furious linesman then launched a savage attack on the supporter - knocking him out cold with a devastating punch to the jaw. This sparked a pitch invasion as friends of the battered fan rushed onto the field and started attacking the linesman, forcing players to intervene.

I have access – and I’m not the only one – to a number of friends in the US who love football, or soccer as they call it.“We have work to do to get the £m – but it is doable – but we can’t do it without help from the fans.”When asked further about when the Dons board would have a clear financial plan in place for funding the stadium, Cormack added: “It may be sooner than thatfor us to know and it may take a little bit longer.“What we have to do is come up with what we want the stadium to look like, and what do we want it to have and that will include consultation with fans.“We’ll have input from football architects on top of the architects we’re using here.“When we’ve got that we’ll then be able to have a look at the financing side.“Where we are as a club the cup is half full or half empty.“To me it’s a half full – we got rid of £m worth of debt in , there’s no bank debt.“We funded separately the training campus and we have doubled the football budget since Derek McInnes has been here.”Initially when the Kingsford plans were unveiled in  the stadium was estimated at a cost of £m.But by spending more on the ground Cormack, who has visited a number of recently-built stadiums with commercial director Rob Wicks for research, believes it can be more beneficial to the Dons in the long term.He said: “When you research other stadium builds you end up asking ‘ you spend £m how much extra revenue can you generate ’“The answer might be a £m, but whatyou spend £m  We thinkwe do spend that we can generate an extra £m-£m in turnover per year.“That is more palatable to investors and people like myself.“These are the things we are going through just now to make sure we get it right.“We’re starting our consultation with all our stakeholders in the autumn.“The good news is that in the States I have access to some of the top people who fund stadiums, like Spurs’ new stadium.“We get access to best practices and what is really doable.“We need to explore all the avenues, we’ve visited other clubs like Atlanta, Arsenal and Newcastle and Belgium.“When you go and visit these places,you are curious and ask the right questions about what worked and what didn’t work, you learn something.“Right now we’re in this evaluation mode looking at the pluses and challenges about how clubs delivered their stadiums.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/EE-KT-310519-01-004-374x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet molly stanley and lexi are looking for new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home. vw, px\"  This little sweetheart is Molly.She is between  and  years old and would love to move to a quiet and peaceful home where she can be pampered and watch the world go by outside the window.Molly would prefer not to be homed around other cats, but she has experience of being around children over four years old.This girl loves her treats, so a well-stocked cupboard is a must! vw, px\"  This gorgeous Alaskan Malamute is five-year-old Lexi.She is a very smiley girl, known around the home for her sweet nature.

collect mail – a journey taking around two hours and two bus rides each way for those relying on public transport.The Evening Express reported last month how Royal Mail was reconsidering its decision to remove the vital service after Aberdeen South and North Kincardine MSP Maureen Watt had urged it to think again.She branded it “unacceptable” for residents to face the journey to Westhill to pick up parcels and called on Royal Mail to think again, urging bosses to find a “common- sense solution”.The organisation has now performed a U-turn, confirming in a letter to Ms Watt that the service would be reinstated.An exact date for itshas not yet been given by bosses.The MSP hailed the announcement and praised the impact she believes it will have on the le of residents, particularly the area’s elderly population.She said: “This will make a big dference to the Culter community, particularly elderly people, and I commend everyone who helped resolve this problem.“Having raised these concerns with Royal Mail I am delighted that a common-sense solution has been identied and look forward to hearing further as this develops.”The letter, signed by Royal Mail senior public affairs

Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures.

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

After gorse was taken away and sand imported from other parts of the site, the new th, known as lsquoHillhouse,rsquo replaces the former par- th hole.To create a better link between the th green and the former th fairway, Kimber has also built new teeing grounds near the th green to enable play towards the new th fairway from a completely dferent angle and achieve a right-to-left dogleg hugging the railway line.With the alterations ready for the start of the  season, the new th ndash which at  yards features an undulating green, pot bunkers around the green and a view to Arran looking back down the hole ndash has already proved popular with members and visitors.Bob Anderson, Greens Convenor at Kilmarnock , said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the new th hole, it couldnrsquot have looked better.

He succeeded only in haemorrhaging votes to the SNP and the Lib Dems.Post-drubbing, he has changed his mind and positioned his party as being unequivocally pro-Remain. He also says he will campaign around Scotland for the UK to stay in the EU.However, it is important to understand some of the root causes of why his European campaign bombed. The SNPrsquos election communication included a picture of Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish Tories put Ruth Davidson front and centre of their literature. Scottish Labourrsquos main leaflet, by contrast, had a picture of Corbyn. Leonard was nowhere to be seen.ldquoIrsquove had conversations with Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and we both agree that that was a mistake, because his picture wasnrsquot on the leaflet in Wales either, he says.Given that one of Leonardrsquos main problems is a low profile, such a decision by the UK party seems unforgivable. But it could have been even worse.ldquoThe leaflet that you describe originally had a text which didnrsquot recognise that wersquove got dferent challenges facing public services in Scotland. And so we had to re-write the text, Leonard says.Revealed: SNP ministers former staff received thousands in secret exit paymentsI put it to him that the picture decision was made by Corbynrsquos office, with the finger of suspicion being pointed at communications director Seamus Milne.ldquoI wasnrsquot involved in the negotiations about that, he says, weakly.This reply sums up the last twenty years of Scottish Labour. If Leonard is the leader of an autonomous party, he should not have to ldquonegotiate to have his face on his own partyrsquos leaflet. Little wonder critics hurl the branch office jibe at him.ldquoI accept that, as much as possible, the election should have been used as a  to promote me, he says.Leonard and Corbyn are political allies, but the Scottish Labour leaderrsquos colleagues believe the pair are too close. Colin Smyth, a member of Leonardrsquos shadow cabinet, said last week that he had to become his ldquoown man. Is Smyth correct ldquoI donrsquot accept this narrative that I am simply there as Jeremy Corbynrsquos man in Scotland, he says. ldquoI accept that I need to present myself, and make it absolutely clear, that there is a distinctive Scottish Labour party position on things.He also believes that Scottish Labour may need more autonomy: ldquoThere is still work that needs to be done, some battles that need to be re-fought, to establish the importance of having a distinctive Scottish Labour presentation to the people of Scotland.An area of potential reform is party discipline. One racism case relating to a Scottish member has dragged on for over eighteen months, but the investigation is handled at a UK level. Leonard is sympathetic to this changing:ldquoThere has been a debate about whether the current disciplinary process inside the Labour party...is fit for purpose. And I think that there is a case to be examined around that.:SNP councillor raises questions about partys poundk indyref fundraiserHowever, Leonardrsquos dficulties as leader did not start with the European election campaign. After he defeated moderate MSP Anas Sarwar to succeed Kezia Dugdale in , his allies believe he has been undermined by a relentless series of briefings, leaks and sniping.ldquoOf course I get frustrated when things are leaked, but in the end wersquove got to try and focus as a party, not on ourselves, but on all those people, in all those communities, that need a Labour Government, he says.ldquoThe Scottish Labour party will only succeed when we are outward looking and when we talk about the things that are important to the people we need to appeal to.Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, a leading Corbyn critic, recently wrote on WhatsApp that Scottish Labour is full of ldquothugs and incompetents. It was then leaked. What did Leonard think of these comments ldquoFirst of all, I dismiss the allegation. And, secondly, I just donrsquot think it is constructive or helpful.He also points out that Murray is a member of Labourrsquos governing Scottish Executive committee :ldquoHe is part of the leadership of the Scottish Labour party. If hersquos got views, he should express them, but he should express them in a more measured way.Sarwar, who Leonard sacked from his shadow cabinet last year, also piped up with an analysis of the partyrsquos woes last week. The Glasgow MSP said the leadership ldquomust decide whether they speak for a clique or faction, or ldquowhether they speak for all of our party.Leonard does not appear impressed with his colleaguersquos comments: ldquoI donrsquot recognise the description that the Scottish Labour party is some kind of clique. We are a party which embraces all the traditions of the Labour movement.I askhe believes Sarwar was loyal to him when he served in the shadow cabinet:ldquoHe was somebody who, I think, performed well in the Parliament, but when the year was up I decided to review the shadow cabinet and had a reshuffle. That is code for no.Picture: Leonard and SarwarCuriously, however, he seems to talk about the devolution of extra powers in the context of a post-Brexit UK, which since last week is an outcome he says he is opposing:ldquoIf Brexit were to happen, then areas of decision-making that currently rest with a Commission in Brussels, a European Parliament that convenes in plenary session in Strasbourg, thatrsquos subject to, in the end, decision-making by a Council of Ministers, and is overseen by a European Court of Justicehellip. we withdraw from the European Union we will no longer be part of these institutions. So we need to consider where those powers will now rest. I know what he means, but his form of words has a Bennite ring.:Senior trade unionist urged to apologise over comments about anti-semitism witch hunt filmA looming row is over the selection of Labour candidates for Holyrood. A majority of his MSPs voted for Sarwar and group meetings are said to be brutal. Some of Leonardrsquos allies want the partyrsquos SEC, which has a left wing majority, to hand pick some of the candidates. Such a move could lead to a cull of serving MSPs and a civil war.Would he be in favour of the SEC being able to rank some of the candidates, rather than members  ldquoThat will be up to the SEC, comes the reply.I repeat the question and he again defers to the SEC. He is clearly thinking about it. ldquoIn each dferent Scottish Parliament election, from  onwards, there has been a dferent system employed for selecting people for the List. So we shall see, he says. I half expect him to wink at me at this point.Leonard, perhaps improbably for a man who has just led his party to fth place, is focused on coming first at the next Holyrood election. He has a dig at predecessors who have racked up a tally of defeats.ldquoOne of my criticisms of the Scottish Labour party in times past has been that our ambition was simply to be a strong opposition. If we donrsquot believe in ourselves, why should we expect anybody  to believe in us and vote for us He adds: ldquoThere is no reason why Scottish Labour canrsquot win those elections in , because we will be offering the most radical programme of economic, social and environmental change in the history of devolution.His problem will be convincing the voters. Some Labour policies are undoubtedly popular, but the same judgement cannot be made of his party.ldquoPeople may have lost their faith, or seen their faith diminished, in the Labour party, he concedes. ldquoBut I donrsquot think their faith has diminished in the values of the Labour party. My job is to make the Scottish Labour party the vehicle for the realisation of those hopes."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-snp-ministers-former-staff-received-thousands-in-secret-exit-payments","story":"Several ex-employees for Ash Denham, Minister for Community Safety, have received pay-offs with some signing gagging clauses after leaving her employ.The revelations have prompted calls for greater transparency over settlement agreements which come from the public purse.Denham, MSP for Edinburgh Eastern, has recently settled a dispute with one former employee who complained that she had breached confidentiality by passing on personal details.Christine Jardine: The future looks bright for our partyThe MSPrsquos former employee resigned and started official proceedings after discovering an email detailing their personal health problems had allegedly been sent to a fellow SNP MSP.It is understood the dispute has been settled with any potential tribunal proceedings now being dropped.In  and , the National Union of Journalists trade union represented other employees of Denham who had complained about their treatment.One staff member was given a pound, compensation payment as part of a settlement agreement, which included a non-disclosure clause, after complaining they had been discriminated against on the grounds of disability, and in another case an employee was given more than pound, as a lsquogood will paymentrsquo when they quit their post.They cited victimisation and bullying from within the MSPrsquos office - not by the MSP - as part of their reason for leaving and said their job was no longer tenable.One SNP source told the Herald on Sunday: ldquoShe [Ash] needs to control what is going on in her office.ldquoThere is also a question to be asked about where this information is recorded and how easily available it is to the public, to be able to see what their money is being spent on. Itrsquos not clear that these practices happen, and who is doing this.:Lib Dems call for freedom of information legislation to be expandedIn , the Scottish Parliament removed the non-disclosure clause from its standard settlement agreement. It does not rule out the use of such agreements, with gagging clauses still able to be usedboth parties agree to it.The settlement agreements used by Denham for two of the cases contained non-disclosure clauses within them.According to official figures, MSPs offered their staff settlement agreements  times between February  and February .The total amount paid out was pound,. with parliament officials stating none of the cases related to bullying or harassment.A spokesman said such payments would typically come from MSP staff cost allowances, currently capped at pound,.An SNP spokesman said: \"We do not comment on employment matters. MSPs, in common with all employers, are able to let staff go in line with HR advice, guidance and legal requirements where their employment is no longer required.\"A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: ldquoSettlement agreements are a legitimate means of facilitating the ending of an employment relationship on mutually agreed terms and do not affect former employeesrsquo right to make a protected disclosure such as whistleblowing.Some politicians have raised concerns about the use of non-disclosure agreements by elected officials.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: ldquoThis is certainly not transparent. I have a number of concerns about NDAs and the way they are used to gag people.ldquoI am surprised they would be used by any elected member.:Richard Leonard in row over plan which could cull Labour MSPsA Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ldquoWith the allegations against Joanna Cherry still unresolved, this is a really bad look for the SNP.ldquoI wonder how quickly Nicola Sturgeon will describe Ash Denham as an lsquoassetrsquo to the SNP government Traditionally NDAs have been used by corporations to prevent those employees leaving the business from disclosing confidential information or trade secrets, which could hinder their former companiesthey move to new job.The controversial element comes from when they are used to settle employment disputes. If a member of staff claims they have been wrongfully dismissed or discriminated against, employers have been found to settle the disputes to avoid any negative publicity, by paying staff and asking them to sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement.By signing the agreement, employees are effectively legally bound not to repeat or discuss any of the allegations again in public, leading to the agreements being commonly described as gagging clauses.The use of non-disclosure agreements and clauses specically in discrimination cases, is currently under review in Westminster, with hundreds of submissions received in the past six months.It comes following revelations that employees of businessman Sir Phillip Greene signed NDAs when they accused him of sexual and racial discrimination.The Topshop tycoon was accused of making racist comments to black employees, groping female staff, and of being aggressive towards both male and female workers - all of which he denies.Westminsters Women and Equalities committee have heard evidence from business leaders, human rights campaigners and lawyers about their views on the use of NDAs in discrimination cases.Scottish employment law firm Thompsons solicitors were among those which submitted evidence.In its submission in November, the firm states thatthe clauses were banned altogether \"this would ensure that the true extent of sexual harassment and discrimination claims within the workplace was much more widely known.\"\"In addition, it would prevent serial offenders within a workplace having their conduct so easily ldquohushed up by their employer.\"Surely,there were several employees who all had their sexual harassment claims settled, in circumstances where the employees could discuss what happened to them, questions would need to be answered by senior managers in regards to what action,any, they were taking to address the perpetratorrsquos conduct.In addition, we believe thatwomen were able to speak about what happened to them in the workplace it is more likely that other women who have suffered similar acts of harassment or discrimination may come forward due to having a collective voice and therefore there being more likelihood that they would be believed.\"The flip side of banning NDAs is that it may prevent employers from settling employment claims. A confidentiality clause can have huge value for an employer whose reputation means a lot to them, their customers and their business. Therefore,NDAs were not permitted, an employer may be more likely to run sexual harassment cases to Tribunal in order to seek to prove that the harassment didnrsquot take place.\"The firm suggested that one way of controlling their use would be to force companies to publish how many they use in any given year, similar to the practice of publishing annual figures on the gender pay.SNP MP Hannah Bardell has also spoken previously about having to sign an NDA before becoming an elected politician, and welcomed the suggestion by the solicitors firm.She added: \"I think thats a very good idea. I dont knowit would work in the public sector or in politics, but certainly for the private sector I think it is a good idea.\"In my own experience having been through it myself in the private sector, I signed one because I felt pressured and I havent had another option.\"The reality is there are legitimate uses and illegitimate uses, and getting into the complexity of that is very dficult. Good employment practised for members and for staff, and support for staff and members is absolutely vital.\"They are all things that, whatever parliament we are in need to be constantly reviewed and addressed to make sure that everybody gets adequate support of there are any employment issues.\" Having looked into technical points of NDAs it is clear there are helpful uses but they are massively open to abuse as well, and I can only speak from a business perspective on that, from my own experience.\"Finding a way to stop the misuse is very challenging and I dont think anyone has been able to answer that question yet.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9933256.jpg?type=article-full","title":"outdoor-play-gets-funding-boost","story":"But for many it has been seen as an option only for the middle-classes and those able to afford the expensive costs of private daycare.Now children from disadvantaged backgrounds are to be given the same opportunity to spend their nursery years learning outside thanks to a Scottish familyrsquos donation of half a million pounds to create new outdoor nurseries in some of the most deprived communities.The pound, gt has been made anonymously to the charity Inspiring Scotland with a view to establishing a new social investment fund and social enterprises to run the nurseries.:Never mind the weather, let children go out and playThere are currently only  fully outdoor nurseries in Scotland, but the fund will support up to , children over a five-year period to access outdoor play and learning, concentrating on disadvantaged areas where there is limited or no outdoor nursery provision.The fundrsquos use of a social enterprise model to set up outdoor nurseries in deprived communities is designed to have a major impact on the le chances of children from some of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Research from around the world demonstrates the enormous benefits to childrenrsquos health, wellbeing and development of getting outside to play and learn.The right to play is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Scottish Government has issued guidance titled Out to Play designed to offer advice on building new outdoor nurseries, as well as encouraging indoor nurseries to get children outside more often, whatever the weather.:Playground politics as Presiding Officer fights for school greenspace#Celia Tennant, Inspiring Scotland Chief Executive, said: ldquoWe are delighted by the generosity of this donation to support the health, wellbeing and development Scotlandrsquos children.ldquoWe believe that playing and learning outdoors, being active and having fun is a crucial part of a childrsquos development, and we want all children in Scotland to be able to do that.\"This funding will allow us to create daily le-enhancing outdoor experiences for children from some of Scotlandrsquos most deprived neighbourhoods.\"She added: \"This new private funding is testament to a growing movement in Scotland to embrace outdoor learning and of a deepening understanding of the huge physical, mental, social and emotional benefits of playing outside from an early age.Initially, the fund will select and invest in five organisations to set up as social enterprises to run outdoor nurseries in dferent deprived communities.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity dog walk to be held at haddo","story":"Employees of Nicol of Skene will be hosting a charity dog walk at Haddo Country Park in July.The event will be held on Sunday, July  at .am.The idea for the event was created through the love for dogs Nicol of Skene employees have and, their partnership with the cancer care charity, Friends of ANCHOR.The charity is one very close to many at Nicol of Skene.Richard Stott, Managing Director at Nicol of Skene, said: “Friends of ANCHOR are a very important charity in the North East of Scotland and unfortunately, many lives have been affected by cancer, our staff included. “The dog walk is a fantastic opportunity to have a great day out to raise money for a worthwhile cause.”Tickets for the charity dog walk cost £ per adult, £. per child and all dogs go free.The cost includes a sandwich, a bottle of water and all dogs participating will receive a free doggy goody bag.

The Charter – which was launched late last year – lays out the purpose and aims of Fair Trade as agreed by the two largest global Fair Trade organisations: the World Fair Trade Organisation and Fairtrade International.The new document refreshes the vision of Fair Trade and more closely aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goalsby highlighting Fair Trade’s longstanding role in addressing challenges covered by the SDGs, including inequality, gender rights, and climate change. The Charter lays out the unique approach, achievements and impacts of Fair Trade and illustrates how inclusive economic growth, fair wages and better working conditions can be achieved while empowering women and ensuring opportunities for the next generation.Aberdeenshire became the seventeenth Fairtrade Zone in , contributing to Scotland becoming a Fairtrade Nation.The area’s current Fairtrade Zone status continues until May , and one of the points in the Council’s Environment and Climate Change Policy states a commitment to develop an approach to ensure that local environmental, social and economic issues relating to the health and fair treatment of people are considered while also strengthening Aberdeenshire as a Fairtrade Zone.Following its decision last week, chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Sustainability Committee, Colin Pike, said: “Pledging support for the new International Fair Trade Charter further demonstrates Aberdeenshire Council’s commitment to the global Fair Trade movement.“We as a Sustainability Committee and as a Council fully endorse the aims and refreshed vision for Fair Trade in the ever-changing world we live in, and in line with our Environment and Climate Change Policy.” Vice chair, Isobel Davidson, added: “Aberdeenshire Council has been committed to the Fair Trade movement for a number of years now in ious capacities, and pledging our support for this new International Charter is a further demonstration of our continued advocacy going forward.”Aberdeenshire Council is also a member of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum . The Forum was established in January  to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland.The SFTF is encouraging other local authorities and public bodies to recognise the International Fair Trade Charter as a common reference document for the global Fair Trade movement.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Junior Doric Verse competitors\"  Society hosts Strichen Festival viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year. The service is anonymous, confidential and non-judgemental. You can get in touch by calling   or emailing Jo@samaritans.org or write to Chris, Freepost RSRB-KKBY-CYJK, PO Box , Stirling, FK SA.

He survived to fight in the Middle East. So that was quite a lucky thing for him.”Leonard Elliss, who died in , was one of six siblings to serve during the war, including two sisters with the Royal Voluntary Service. All survived.Stanley Elliss, an RAF sergeant who was commando-trained, arrived with his comrades on Gold Beach.He was deployed to capture, secure and fit out for operational use a German airstrip at Beny-sur-Mer ready for Spitfire squadrons supporting the invasion.He described how they stepped into “about a foot of water” before walking on to the beach and being warned about German snipers.Mr Elliss, of Kent, said: “I’ve been to France quite a few times but to be close to the beaches, it’s really a marvellous thought. It’s something I didn’t think was going to happen a year ago and I’m looking forward to being on the beach at Arromanches.“It’s been a great surprise to be involved in such a good exercise. I can’t thank the people who have raised it enough.”Vincent Horton, , from Stoke, said he had not spoken to his family about his time on Juno Beach on D-Day.“I was waiting in the wings because I went in on D+,” Mr Horton said.“I was at Juno with the Royal Marines  Battalion and many Canadians. I was what they called Combined Ops.“A lot of people are talking about what happened on D-Day but there are a lot of things that happened away from D-Day. I never talk to my children about what happened on D-Day.”On Sunday, the veterans boarded the ship atDover and were welcomed by the Dover Sea Cadet Band and a guard of honour.Rod Stewart performed his  hit Sailing for those on board, with a recording by Dame Vera Lynn also played.In the message, Dame Vera said: “It will be nostalgic and sure to bring back lots of memories. Rest assured we will never forget all you did for us.”Today, the veterans will watch an amphibious display by the Royal Navy in Poole Harbour while tomorrow they will attend the national commemorative event in Portsmouth before travelling to Normandy for events in Bayeux and Arromanches on Thursday, the th anniversary.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"monica lennon i ve seen how drink scars families","story":"Scotland has taken bold action towards tackling alcohol harm in recent years. We now have policies like minimum unit pricing and a new alcohol strategy that acknowledges the scale of the challenge we face in Scotland.Yet despite some positive advancements in Scottish Government policy over the last decade, alcohol harm is costing Scotland £. billion annually and is still contributing to the death of people we know or love, every single day. People like -year-old Gerry from Lanarkshire – my dad – who died fouryears ago.Growing up around alcohol has a big influence over us, especially for the ,+ children in Scotland living with a problem drinker.The statistics bring home the scale of the challenge. I know, because my family has been one of them and I’ve seen first-hand how “social drinking” can spiral into full-blown dependency and destroy relationships, careers, health and happiness. During my time in Parliament, speaking up about Scotland’s relationship with alcohol has been a personal priority.I’ve raised the issue of tackling stigma directly with the First Minister and as Co-Convenor of the Cross-Party Group on Drugs and Alcohol Misuse. Addiction is an illness and problem drinking in Scotland is a public health emergency. Social stigma and corporate influences are strong, so our decision-makers need to have courage.That’s why the collaboration between the Children’s Parliament and Alcohol Focus Scotland is exciting. Young people talking openly about alcohol and how it affects them in their everyday lives is a powerful message to politicians.So, with young people pushing for change, like those in the Children’s Parliament that I’m looking forward to welcoming to the Scottish Parliament soon, I am optimistic about our future and the progress that is possible. Communities need more services and investment and that’s why Scottish Labour is committed to a social responsibility levy. The legal provision already exists for this additional tax on alcohol sales. We simply want the Scottish Government to enact this and reinvest the funds in communities and recovery programmes.A public health approach that protects young people and changes our attitudes to alcohol can make Scotland a healthier and happier nation.Monica Lennon is Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"life re injected into edinburgh international film festival alistair harkness","story":"The programme launch of the Edinburgh International Film Festival has been a dispiriting affair in recent years, with too few films of note to get excited about and far too many unknown quantities proving they were unknown quantities for a reason.Opening with Edinburgh director Ninian Doff’s properly funny coming-of-age comedy Boyz in the Wood, however, the rd edition of the festival proves there’s le in the old dog yet.There is the UK premieres of Jim Jarmusch’s recent Cannes-opener The Dead Don’t Die, Joanna Hogg’s Sundance-winning The Souvenir and — headlining a commemorative retrospect — Varga by Agnès, the final film by the late, great Agnès Varda.

Even though that lead evaporated in the latest Opinium poll , they’re still celebrating a first UK top spot in nine years.: Dani Garavelli: ‘I disagree with Jo’ moment a bad start for SwinsonThe good news for the Lib Dems is that English Remain voters have either forgotten their part in imposing university tuition fees and austerity or decided there are bigger Brexit fish to fry. Whatever the reason, the party most used to losing deposits is riding high. But will they be able to capitalise on this opportunity without the weel kent face of Sir Vince Cable at the helm  : Jo Swinson: I will take on ‘independence obsessed’ SNPThe battle to replace him as leader at the end of July is a modest affair compared with the Tories’ -strong line-up. It features just two candidates: Sir Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Nominations close on  June, the day Theresa May bids a tearful farewell. But at that point the Lib Dems must decide what kind of party they really are – nasty or nice Tory-lite or genuinely radical a one-trick, anti-Brexit pony or a vigorous and serious potential government. It won’t be as easy as it looks. The party’s moment in the sun may finally have arrived but beyond “Bollocks to Brexit” it’s not clear the party has a winning slogan, distinctive policies or a new leader capable of commanding the UK stage.Take Sir Ed Davey, whose radical credentials are surely damaged by taking a gong from the Tories in consolation for losing his seat after the coalition debacle. Sir Ed’s record as energy minister is underwhelming from a Scottish perspective. Subsidies for community hydro and solar  were cut and vital subsea connectors to the Northern and Western Isles vetoed because islanders wouldn’t knuckle down and build vast wind farms tode-risk the project and simply the budgeting process. Even though Alistair Carmichael was Scottish Secretary at the time, the long-awaited Northern Isles cables weren’t built on the Lib Dems’ watch. Mind you, Sir Ed did approve connectors to Norway and Ireland instead. Nice. He also introduced contracts for dferencein place of subsidies for onshore and offshore wind plus marine renewables. Somehow Scots firms have won only a handful of these contracts and a new island-shaped CfD was only introduced last week. Soon after losing his seat in , Ed was knighted and joined the PR firm that represents EDF Energy. EDF had just been awarded the contract to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by… Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey. Oh, yes, and Sir Ed supports fracking too. This is what passes for a radical record on tackling climate change in England.Anyway, back to Brexit – doubtless the Lib Dems’ strongest card. Sir Ed wants to use “the Cooper-Letwin process” so the Brexit default is Revoke rather than No Deal on \u2028 October. Whoop, whoop. When the crowd-funded Revoke Article  legal action failed its first hurdle in February , Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine promptly quit. Happily for MPs, all are now legally entitled to press the Revoke button, thanks to the tenacity, vision and co-operative capacity of the original petitioners in the Green, SNP and Labour parties. Without their constancy when the going got rough, Ms Jardine’s colleague Lib Dem MP Tom Brake would not have been able to join the posse in the latter stages and give the Lib Dems a democratic name-check. Poor.Meanwhile Sir Ed’s sole opponent, Jo Swinson, announced her candidacy on last week’s Question Time, taking a pop at the SNP’s failure to close the educational attainment gap. The MP for East Dunbartonshire cited figures from the Scottish Index on Multiple Deprivationwhich suggests only  per cent of children in Govan go on to higher education. This immediately provoked a social media storm, not least from Govan High’s headteacher who cited more recent figures which show the school’s actually doing pretty well. Was this an own goal or just plain baffling  Well, it would be usefula Holyrood statistician could explain how such wildly dfering stats can attach to roughly the same educational cohort. It would also be pointless to maintain that income doesn’t play a shamefully large part in determining access to opportunity in Scotland. But that’s why roughly half the population supports Scottish independence so all policy decisions, tax levers, benefit levels and income streams are under Scottish control, all ability to offload responsibility are at an end and a truly concerted sht of resources can tackle Dickensian levels of poverty, generated by David Cameron’s Con-Dem coalition government. Just for the record, both Sir Ed and Ms Swinson were members – she voted  times for the bedroom tax, five times against raising benefits in line with inflation, seven times for disability cuts and  times for general welfare cuts. But bygones…Even though the SIMD figures do exist, the statistical basis of her Question Time rebuke was dodgy, the “Milngavie air of superiority”was snfy, the “forced breeziness” a little wearing and the choice of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s seat as a target was negative and predictable. If Ms Swinson aims to outdo Ruth Davidson with high octane attacks on the SNP’s record in office, good luck. The SNP isn’t perfect. But politicians in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. And thanks to the Lib Dems’ disastrous involvement with the Tories, shatterproof glass only covers them south of the Border for the single issue of Brexit. Even there, they must share the honours as second vote champions with the UK Greens. In Scotland, the latest poll puts them in fourth on just  per cent. And this despite winning a seat in recent European elections.If it’s too late to bring on a fresh face, the Lib Dems must find a fresh approach. Otherwise, it’s not just the big two parties that face political oblivion – ultimately, the big two-dependent Lib Dems will become political casualties as well. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s andy murray to make long awaited return to competitive tennis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video... - Andy Murray mayto Wimbledon in doublesIt was revealed yesterday that he had entered the doubles at the Fever-Tree Championships at Queenrsquos Club with Spaniard Feliciano Lopez.That means the Scot will be playing again just four and a half months after surgery to ldquoresurface his right hip.Murray said: ldquoI am really excited toto the match court for the first time since my surgery.ldquoQueenrsquos has always been a special place for me and itrsquos the perfect place to .ldquoItrsquos where I won my first ATP match, my first title in Britain and on grass, and itrsquos been my most successful tournament overall.ldquoIrsquom not yet ready toto the singles court, but Irsquove been pain-free for a few months now.

Bryan was back competing at grand slam level after five months and, seven months into his comeback, he was back winning titles with his twin brother Mike.The resurfacing operation dfers from a total hip replacement in that instead of removing the whole of the top of the femur and replacing it with a metal ball joint, the surgeon shaves down the top of the bone, fits a metal cap over it and places a metal cup in the socket part of the joint.Double Wimbledon single champion Murray had the op at the end of January and the information from his camp since has been limited but cautiously optimistic. Murray, who also won the US Open in , had theprimary aim of curing the constant ndash and at times excruciating ndash pain in his hip. The procedure certainly did that but then, at the end of March, the  year old was seen hitting gently against a practice wall at the Oxshott Sports Club. Suddenly a comeback was looking more of a possibility than a dream and he posted a video on Instagram on Saturday of him hitting a serve on a grass court, boosting hopes that he would soon be seen back on the circuit.The Scot had been dealing with the deteriorating hip problem for several years but, it was during the French Open semi-final in , that the injury went from manageable to unbearable. He reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon that year as defending champion but was knocked out by Sam Querrey of the USA in five sets.He took six months off after that in the hope that rest and rehab would cure the problem but, by January , was forced to resort to minor surgery. When that did not work either, it looked ashis career was over.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk . It also has the support of Burra History Group for the Burra Noost Project and is partnering with Bressay History Group to support their recording of Bressay noosts this summer.Costs such as the website, room hire, resources for free school visits and insurance have so far been financed by the directors. Money is slowly trickling in via donations, sponsorship, and profits from workshop ticket sales. The next workshop is being held in Unst on Saturday st June.The first step of applying to the National Lottery Heritage Fund has been successful, allowing Moder Dy – named after the dialect phrase for the mother wave – to apply for a pot of £, to run the Burra Noost Project.However, at least £, needs to be raised to match this grant funding. Donations and business sponsorshipwould help make the Burra Noost Project a reality and enable Moder Dy to record the ordinary lives of Shetland folk from the days when the four-oared boat was the equivalent to the family car today..."},{"url":null,"title":"junior netball player invited for national trial ","story":"Tahlia Leslie will try out for the Scottish Netball Squad.Tahlia Leslie will try out for the under-s squad when she travels to the Emirates Arena on th June.Scouts spotted her talent during a few dferent district and pathway events this season, according to the Shetland Junior Netball Association.In a post on the group#s Facebook page the association said: #Let’s all wish her well for her trial which is in a few weeks time.#• We will have more on this story in the Sports section of next week#s newspaper..."},{"url":null,"title":"eu election lib dems top poll ahead of snp ","story":"The SNP came second with the Brexit Party taking third place.Lib Dems secured the backing of  voters while the SNP came in with , votes, an increase of . per cent.

Fishermen will always need a market for their landings and remote farmers and crofters know Europe tries to look after them even though nationally agribusiness seeks to pocket too much subsidy. Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters. What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May. This year Mid and East Antrim Borough Council are supporting a range of local iniduals sample market le, including local food producers, crafters and jewellery-makers.Ballymena: Seven Towers Leisure Centre car park, every Saturday from am to pmIf you would be interested in trading at any Mid and East Antrim Borough’s markets please contact-  Claire.duddy@midandeastantrim.gov.uk "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1848671.jpg--.jpg?1558509804000\n","title":"alec backing a very worthy cause by taking part in annual fun run of the glens event","story":"GLENRAVEL man Alec McQuillan is urging local people to take on the ‘Fun Run Of The Glens’ challenge.

As well as gaelic football and soccer, he also found time to play rugby for Armoy RFC. He continues to be involved with the local Con Magees, Glenravel Gaelic Club.GOLFERHis main outdoor pastime now is golf and he is a member of local Ballymena Golf Club.While not a regular cyclist, he has taken part in the FROG for many years.Alec is the chairperson of the Glenravel Community Development Association, which is responsible for the operation of the Glenravel Sports and Community Complex – which hosts the FROG event.The complex includes sports facilities, a health and fitness suite, a community play group and has become established as the social hub for the local community.

They do a tremendous amount of work supporting local cancer patients and their families, doing cancer prevention work in the community, funding research at Queen’s University and advocating for better health policies.“Cancer touches so many of us. My brother, Liam, was diagnosed with cancer back in  and had to have a kidney removed. “This was a very challenging time for him and the family. I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years. The event has now become established as a firm date in the cycling calendar for many cyclists and cycling clubs. “While we are well supported by other cycling clubs from right across Northern Ireland, we’d love even more people to join in.“The glens is a fantastic route, so much scenery to enjoy, and there’s a real feel-good factor and tremendous buzz. “The weather has also been very kind to us over the years. What better way to get fresh air, exercise, meet people and help an extremely worthy cause ”COURSEEntrants can choose the FROG cycle, either a mile, mile or  mile route, or FROG legs, a km or  mile run – there’s something for everyone.Participants who raise a minimum amount for Cancer Focus NI will receive a special commemorative top. Lunch and refreshments are also provided on the day to keep everyone refuelled.Cancer Focus NI is the leading local cancer charity committed to tackling cancer by supporting cancer research, providing services for cancer patients and their families and by advising people how to reduce their risk of the disease.Every penny raised will go towards supporting Cancer Focus NI’s work in the community which includes family support, counselling, a free NurseLine on   , a bra-fitting service for women who’ve had breast surgery, art therapy, creative writing and other therapeutic and complementary services.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours. The young ones are putting their mark on the garden, which is great.”Michael McAllister from Leonard Cheshire Disability commented: “It’s good to get the guys involved in this project.“This is the third day we’ve been here and we’re getting ready for the barbecue next week. It’s been good fun, but it’s a good opportunity for the young people to get involved with Rosemount House.“It’s a good education for them. It’s also about creating more awareness in Belfast about homelessness. This is a real positive project for the young people to be involved in.”Michael Bradley, who lectures at Belfast Met, said: “Partnering up with Leonard Cheshire gives young people the chance to give back to the community. They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here. It had quite a big impact on the students, because they could relate to it in some ways. It’s really striking a note with them.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"largest tv in ireland on sale in west belfast electronic store","story":"CUSTOMERS in Noel Grimley Electrics did a double take on Wednesday afternoon as the latest in TV technology was unveiled.The ” Samsung QLED, the first in the north, was unveiled – just in time for Saturday’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.“It’s great to see the TV displayed in the store,” said owner Eamon Grimley, “we are a big Samsung dealer and were the first in the north to sell the K TV. That’s what we are here for, to showcase the latest in technology. People in West Belfast want the latest, most up-to-date technology available,” he said. “The QLED is the screen quality, it’s giving you the best in picture quality. With us being in the area we want to showcase the latest in technology for our customers and make it as accessible to everybody.”With a £. price tag, Gerard Bonner explained how the TV has a wealth of top of the range additions.“The TV is a quantum dot display, so it’s QLED, it has a layer of quantum dots, like wee fine crystals on it so it enhances the colour and the brightness. It’s basically two and a half times brighter than a standard LED TV and there are over a billion colours that come through on the screen.“The two main things with the TV is that it has Apple TV. Previously you couldn’t mirror your iPhone to your TV but you can with this and you can access BT Sport so long as you have the app. If it’s being mounted on the wall and it’s not being used you can upload your own photos, have your own picture collage, a clock, the weather, news headlines coming up, you can change the colour of the background to blend in with your wall.“Grimleys are the first to have it and we expect a lot of interest over the coming days.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PIPS-families.png","title":"pips families provide helping hand to each other","story":"NORTH Belfast suicide prevention charity PIPS has been to the forefront over the years in providing support to iniduals who are considering or who have at some point considered ending their own lives.PIPS also provide support to families and friends who have been touched by suicide, with their family group the driving force behind such support.PIPS Family Group Meeting takes place every Wednesday night from pm to pm in Tesco at Cityside.The group is currently made up of seven members, all women who have lost a family relative to suicide.Two such members are Patricia Perry, who lost her son Johnin , andAnne McKenna, wholost her son Broguein .Patricia explained how she involved in the group.“My son died  years ago. PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid would make grand gesture to irish government by covering costs of new digitised border in ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At that time it was reported that someone was soiling the walls with excrement in ious toilets during the weekends.An internal email from May  seen by the Belfastsaid that an incident \"occurred at lunchtime where objects have been thrown out of one of our windows at the front of the building\".Following an investigation, it \"also materialised that staff have been spitting out of windows too\".The email referenced a previous incident in which \"liquid was thrown from one of the windows and hit a member of the public\".Senior managers are looking at ways of addressing unsociable behaviour, with staff being reminded that such matters are disciplinary offences.A further internal email, from May , referenced the closure of the third floor mens toilets in the Plaza Building. It said that \"certain staff members are intent on vandalising them, to the detriment and inconvenience of other staff members\".The email also asked staff to remain vigilant when using the toilets, having \"long since given up on appealing to the better nature\" of the iniduals responsible.

As we all know to get an agreement everybody has to agree, and there wasnt an agreement last February. Very publicly there wasnt an agreement,\" she said.\"Obviously what we want to do is find a way forward that everybody is comfortable with, that everybody can subscribe to and thats what were engaged in at the moment.\"The DUP leader said the party was \"constructively engaging\" in the talks.\"I very much hope that we can continue in the constructive way that we have been engaging and we can find a way forward,\" she said.\"We are up for finding a way forward as quickly as possible. It has to be a balanced way forward and one that everyone in society can sign up to.\"Last week, the issue of an Irish Language Act made headlines again after more than  figures from the worlds of sport, music and politics signed an open letter to Leo Varadkar and Theresa May calling for legislation to be brought forward.On Monday, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill hinted that Irish language legislation is still a red line for the party.\"It is now time to move beyond that constructive engagement to actually delivering to bring about an Assembly and Executive again,\" she said.\"Success would look like an Executive and Assembly that delivers for all citizens and implementation of previous agreements. That is what we are determined to achieve in this new phase.\""},{"url":null,"title":"its official we are manchester united mad quarter of top supporters clubs worldwide based in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle.

He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me.

As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief.

They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

Ahead of the first episode, Ruth told the News Letter: “I was nervous at the start about it coming on TV. Then whenever I saw the adverts it’s put me at ease a wee bit. Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday. People in Co Tyrone are very genuine.“It might come across as we all know each other but a lot of the people in the show I hadn’t met until we came together for the programme.Country singer Neil“I’d never met Bobby or Lynda or Audrey or Melvin. We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellSerious crash update: One person taken to hospital and road reopened to trafficOne of N.I.s busiest roads to shutdown within the next  minutes*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

There’ll only be agreement when the majority of unionists agree to it.“And we represent the majority of unionists. We’re not particularly concerned about Simon Coveney.”UUP leader Robin Swann said there is a “very small window” left to restore devolution, adding “progress is far from guaranteed”.A party spokesman said: “We have always been clear that the Irish government’s participation in talks should be on the basis of the three-stranded approach and we will continue to ensure that this is the case.”\"  \"  President Donald Trumps handshake with the Queen is causing a social media meltdown Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said of the prospect of reaching a deal: “This will not get doneit goes beyond the end of this month ... it needs to happen this month or I don’t think it will happen.”Sinn Fein said “the two governments have publicly said there has been a constructive engagement and that is also how we would characterise the work done to date it is now time to move beyond that constructive engagement to actually delivering to bring about an Assembly and Executive again”.The Stormont Assembly collapsed in January  when Martin McGuinness walked out of government in protest at the RHI scandal.Ever since, Sinn Fein has refused to re-enter government unless it guarantees “respect”, “equality” and “rights” – with an Irish language act at the top of the list of demands.try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellTwo men rushed to hospital after serious two vehicle smash -

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

She said: “It has been another great show, and we’ve been very lucky with the weather. “A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of our th annual show, especially ABC Council, Translink and principal sponsor ABP. We are also indebted to the many iniduals who give so freely of their time to organise the show.”The cattle and sheep sections attracted a iety of continental, native and traditional breeds.Leading the cattle parade and securing the award for the supreme champion of champions was the Holstein cow Glasson Goldfish Form Erle VG from Philip and Simon Haffey’s -cow herd at Portadown. A second prize winner at Balmoral Show, she calved her third in March and is producing  litres of milk every day. Originating from the noted Erle family at Smiddiehill, her granddam was the ,gns Field of Dreams Formation Erle. The Haffey family have won seven successive Holstein championships at Lurgan Show. Interbreed cattle judge Cyril Millar, from Coleraine, described the overall show champion as a spectacular specimen of the breed. “It’s never an easy task judging beef cattle against dairy cattle, and the exhibitors deserve credit for putting on a tremendous show of quality animals. “Today’s overall winner is a flashy dairy cow with great power and scope. She has a big open frame, a well attached udder, and walks well on sound legs and feet.”Taking the reserve supreme award was the interbreed beef winner, an Aberdeen Angus heer from Richard and Fiona McKeown’s Herd at Templepatrick. This home-bred heer was born in April , and secured the reserve breed titles at Balmoral and Lurgan.  Cyril Millar added: “This heer is a peach of a beast, and a very close second. She oozes breed character from head to toe, and has great conformation and muscle.”Runner-up in the interbreed beef line-up was the two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Nikki exhibited by Nigel and Gail Matchett from Portadown.

I had the idea one Sunday night whilst watching TV. The initial plan was just a sponsored park run k, that led to ‘a why not make this a bit bigger and get St Peters involved’, a couple of phone calls with Ciaran McCavigan at St Peter’s and we had the bones of a plan.”Initial planning started straight away at the end of March with a lot of work between the clubs to coordinate with council PSNI etc.The Rugby Club and St Peter’s have been making great strides in reaching across the communities in Lurgan as David explained: “The friendship between the clubs started back a couple of years ago when Lurgan RFC contacted St Peter’s about getting a joint code session for the kids, this developed into our game of two halves and we’ve kept that up by having afixture in St Peter’s, this joint venture made lots of sense as it brought us together in a non-contested space i.e. Lurgan Park“It’s really important to stress that both the guys in St Peter’s and the Tigers see our joint projects as being something that will be long term, we aren’t interested in short term publicity or gains there is a firm commitment on both sides to deliver opportunities for all our kids and young people to interact and play sport together in a fun environment.David said the response has been Really positive so far with the PSNI, Council and Lord Mayor’s office all “really enthused”. Local businesses have got behind it too with Tesco Lurgan supplying fruit, People First snack boxes and River Rock water for participants: “People seem to really get on board with the cross community aspect and the whole concept, the support has been obvious from everyone who’s sponsored one of the kids.A total of around  are expected to take part in the run, start from the clubs at .pm. There will be relay runners leaving respective clubs and meeting in the centre of the town in the plaza at Market St , the last relay runners will exchange a football and a rugby ball in lieu of a baton before all the participants head down Windsor Avenue together to start the actual route in the park, It’s about k in the park for older kids and a shorter easier route for younger members.David said: “We hope everyone will join us afterwards at the fountain for refreshments, a bit of craic and hopefully a few rugby and footballs on the go.“We reckon this will be a very successful event that helps show what sport can do to bring communities together. It’s been great to work with Ciaran to get the run organised and we are already thinking of what we can do to build on this idea.”Translink display at Lurgan show ahead of railway line closure

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.

Oh, and a deal on Brexit could be getting another outing, while outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May will soon leave the front of the political stage and a would-be successor taking up the reins of a stagecoachwhich has been out of control for months, and could still be heading for a ravine in the coming weeks. A potential deal of sorts should be going before the Commons again soon, in an attempt to get some form of plan in place to ensure the stability of the UK economy as a whole, and that trade can continue unabatedbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic. So, who’s in the running to take up the mantle from Theresa  As I write this, the bookies’ favourite is Boris. Yes, that Boris. The man who was one of the forerunners to the convoluted chaos we’ve now found ourselves in. I think the word chaos applies regardless of whether you voted Remain or Leave – what we’ve had to endure from the powers that be since the referendum in has been nothing short of an horrendous inability and incapability of showing leadership.

Aaron Taylor and former telecoms boss Scott Ritchie have joined forces to set up Northern Ireland’s first bespoke mail-order pet food business, Snack at Frank’s. The pampered pooch market is one which is booming – with around nine million dogs in the UK alone, and owners spending more than £ on food, snacks and clothing. Mr Taylor, one of the co-founders of the Ormeau Baths, has teamed up with Scott Ritchie, formerly of Connect Telecom to set up Snack at Frank’s – an e-commerce subscription service delivering “healthy and nutritious dog treats straight through your letterbox”. The pair have already raised £, in funding from angel investors and grown to a team of seven, but Mr Taylor says they are already planning to increase the workforce. “There’s a real community of dog owners and pet lovers online but it’s very fragmented,” he told Ulster Business. “Part of what we’re doing with Franks is to provide a space for pet parents to come together and interact with each other to get tips and advice on how to keep a healthy happy dog and how to make it a key part of the family.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
