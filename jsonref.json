However, when he turns 19, he will undergo a physical examination which will determine whether or not he is suitable to enter the military.After two years of conscription, they are placed on the reserve roster and will have to attend a few days of annual military training for six years. South Korea currently has one of the longest military service providers in the world.However, rules put in place in 1973 state that athletes who have won medals in the Olympic Games or gold medals in the Asian Games are granted exemptions from the military service and only required to do four weeks of basic military training, in addition to 42 months worth of sports.They are then put on the same roster as a civilian and they are able to continue with their career during their duty. The 2012 Summer Olympics bronze medal-winning football team, 2008 Olympics gold medalist badminton player Lee Yong-dae, swimmer Park Tae-hwan, 2014 Asian Games gold medalist Hyeon Chung and 2018 Asian Games gold medalist footballer Son Heung-min are all exempt.      However, in 2017, an opposition lawmaker said that the exemptions that are in place at present unfairly exclude the achievements of bands such as BTS, saying: ‘If you win a classical music competition such as in violin or piano, military exemption is granted.‘However, winning a pop music competition, such as the Billboard albums chart, gets you nothing.’ According to Korea Boo, in May 2018, an amendment was made to the South Korea Military Service Law that meant that any male who is 28 and older cannot delay their enlistment for any reason.In addition to this, men who are between 25 and 27 must receive permission to travel outside of the country and each male can only obtain five of these foreign travel permits, each permit allowing up to six months of overseas travel.These new laws will result in a lot of problems for the music business, especially for BTS if they decide to embark on another world tour, for example. Alongside this, groups like BTS, EXO and GOT7 will enter the military sooner than planned and having to put their careers on hiatus much earlier.The BTS members are already 25 or will turn 25 soon, which will mean that they will not be permitted to travel as freely as they have done so before and could mean that they may not be able to appear on television or at award ceremonies as often because they choose to use up their travel allowance for tours.Who is Jair Bolsonaro?

File photoThe remaining 50 all came from restaurants. Although the FSA acknowledged that many of the samples had come from businesses already under suspicion, that number is still disturbingly high.As someone who has written extensively about the food industry for three decades, the revelation does not come as a surprise. I have no doubt that over the next few years, the percentage of meat coming from dubious origins will continue to rise unless something drastic is done — which I fear will never happen.Bring back pub grub! Diners in backlash against...Over a fifth of meat in Britain\u0027s restaurants and...Share this articleThere are two main reasons for my pessimism. First, there is the nature of the meat industry itself, which is a rapacious sector riddled with far too many businesses that are willing to boost their profits by adulterating their products.While all industries and sectors have their rogue elements, I believe there is a systemic problem within the meat industry that makes it particularly attractive to unscrupulous characters who are really nothing more than criminals.The issue is the complexity and length of the meat supply chain. If you buy, say, a chicken-based ready-meal from a supermarket, the meat could have come from as far as Thailand or Brazil. As you might imagine, that chicken will pass through many hands — sometimes literally — before it ends up on the prongs of your fork here in Britain.Worse still, the meat will often be partially processed somewhere along that chain — usually with salt and water added to boost flavour and volume — which is quite legal.          Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat However, what you can do is avoid processed foods and never buy ready mealsAt various stages of the process, it is very easy for someone to do something they shouldn\u0027t. With so many possible opportunities to interfere with the product it is enormously difficult to police the problem and, in particular, to identify who is responsible for any contamination.Although it is harder to pass off other meats as chicken, there is no doubt lamb — which is expensive — is often boosted by adding a cheaper meat such as beef, or worse still, horse. And of course, the more meat is processed — such as mincing it — the easier it is to disguise.This sort of activity has all the ethical bankruptcy of the drug dealer who cuts his cocaine with some other white powder in order to boost the quantity of his product and therefore his bottom line. Many will remember the horse meat scandal of five years ago, when many products in British and Irish supermarkets were found to contain horse. In one instance, all the meat in a Findus beef lasagne was found to have come from horses rather than cattle.At the time, the then prime minister, David Cameron, promised to get tough on what he called a \u0027very shocking crime\u0027, but that was little more than fine words. In truth, apart from a few arrests, nothing substantial happened.If anything, things got worse, which brings me to the second part of the problem — the spinelessness of food regulation in this country.           One-hundred-forty-five items out of 665 tested as part of a Food Standards Agency (FSA) report contained animal DNA that was not listed on the packagingIn the past, there was a comprehensive system of monitoring undertaken by the FSA and local Trading Standards officers, who would mount regular inspections of restaurants, takeaways, abattoirs, and indeed any form of food processing plant or food supplier.But that system is in crisis. In 2011, the FSA inspected 2,917 abattoirs and cutting plants. In 2017, it visited just 1,725 — a fall of just over 40 per cent. The FSA says this is because of a cut in funding. If that is indeed the case, then how hollow David Cameron\u0027s words seem today.Anecdotally, I hear FSA inspections are treated almost as a joke by many in the industry. As soon as inspectors arrive at a meat plant, an anodyne announcement will come over the Tannoy, saying something like, \u0027A set of keys has been found next to the drinks machine\u0027. This will be a coded instruction for employees swiftly to hide anything untoward.With fewer and less effective inspections, the FSA is essentially relying on whistleblowers to do its work. It has set up an organisation called the National Food Crime Unit, a new law enforcement agency which was established in the wake of the horse meat scandal. However, its funding appears pitiful, with the FSA board approving a mere £2.1 million for next year.So with inadequate monitoring and enforcement, what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves when we buy meat?The first thing to realise is that this really does matter. Those most obviously affected are followers of religions that prohibit the eating of certain types of meat. There is a serious issue if Hindus who don\u0027t eat beef are being given it instead of lamb, or if Muslims and Jews are being tricked into buying dishes containing pork.If you don\u0027t follow one of these religions then you may not think it a problem that you are accidentally eating a different type of meat. However, believing the tainted meat scandal is something you can safely ignore would be a mistake — there can be no doubt that businesses that tell porkers about their meat will also cut costs with food hygiene and safety.Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat — and besides, that would ruin the relaxing fun of going out for a meal.However, what you can do is avoid processed foods. Never buy ready meals. Stay away from burgers made in factories. Don\u0027t go to chain restaurants where the provenance of their meat is all-but impossible to establish.Instead go to local, independent restaurants where it is more likely the chef and owner — often the same person — cares about where the meat comes from, and will be happy to tell you. Try to buy your meat from a good local butcher.And no, what I am suggesting is not going to hurt your purse or wallet. It is a myth that supermarkets and chain restaurants are always better value than their independent competitors. With High Streets around the country struggling, it\u0027s also a great way to support your local community.The essence, then, is to buy meat that has had as small a journey from field to fork as possible, because that is the only way you can be sure of what you eat. It\u0027s that simple. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/00/4FCDB89000000578-0-image-a-44_1536275859204.jpg","title":"Moscow march Russia moves build military power","story":"    Russia is conducting a ‘worrying and alarming’ build-up of military power in regions across the world, it was revealed last nightDespite the focus often put on Russia’s cyber-warfare capabilities, next week it will conduct its largest military exercises in 37 years, involving almost 300,000 troops, in a huge demonstration of force that is causing alarm in Whitehall. Moscow has boasted that the war games – which serve as a reminder to other nations that Russia maintains a huge conventional military arsenal – will involve 1,000 planes, helicopters and drones, up to 80 combat and logistics ships and 36,000 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles.The exercises, called Vostok-2018, will be held in central and eastern Russia and will also include participants from the Mongolian and Chinese militaries.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the drills were justified given the ‘aggressive and unfriendly’ attitudes towards his country, while Russia’s Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov said they will include ‘massive’ mock air strikes and tests of defences against cruise missiles.

It can clearly be regarded as a threat to Western democracy. A miscalculation could very easily lead to an escalation.’While Nato has beefed up defences in Eastern Europe, the Russians have been accused of undermining international efforts for an Afghan-led peace process by inviting the Taliban to Moscow for peace talks. And they have also been accused of indirectly arming the Taliban – something they have repeatedly denied.

While the figures are starkest among younger people, in every age group the biggest group are those identifying with no religion.‘We know that views are becoming more socially liberal. With growing numbers belonging to no religion, faith leaders will no doubt be considering how to better connect to a changing society.’ The steepest fall in those saying they were part of the CofE was among people aged 45 to 54, with the level dropping from 35 per cent to 11 per cent from 2002 to last year.In the same period, those aged 18 to 24 saying they had no religion rose from 56 to 70 per cent.In response to the report, Dave Male, CofE director of evangelism and discipleship, said: ‘The headline figure here only gives us part of the picture. It has been clear for some time that we have moved from an era of people automatically classifying themselves as Church of England or Anglican to one in which identifying with a faith is an active choice.          The number of people who are faithful is higher than figures suggest, according to the church, whose leaders said younger people to not select a denomination ‘People are less aware of denominations. Yet research shows an increase in willingness to engage in faith. People of all ages have not stopped searching for meaning and answers in their life.’ Church officials said 1.1million people go to a CofE church to pray during a typical month. There are also 1.2million followers each month who pray online.The attitudes survey found the numbers holding allegiance to non-Christian religions has risen from 2 per cent in 1983 to 8 per cent in 2017.The report does not break this down but the 2011 census gave the total for Muslims in England and Wales as 2.71million and 817,000 for Hindus.

File photoThe remaining 50 all came from restaurants. Although the FSA acknowledged that many of the samples had come from businesses already under suspicion, that number is still disturbingly high.As someone who has written extensively about the food industry for three decades, the revelation does not come as a surprise. I have no doubt that over the next few years, the percentage of meat coming from dubious origins will continue to rise unless something drastic is done — which I fear will never happen.Bring back pub grub! Diners in backlash against...Over a fifth of meat in Britain\u0027s restaurants and...Share this articleThere are two main reasons for my pessimism. First, there is the nature of the meat industry itself, which is a rapacious sector riddled with far too many businesses that are willing to boost their profits by adulterating their products.While all industries and sectors have their rogue elements, I believe there is a systemic problem within the meat industry that makes it particularly attractive to unscrupulous characters who are really nothing more than criminals.The issue is the complexity and length of the meat supply chain. If you buy, say, a chicken-based ready-meal from a supermarket, the meat could have come from as far as Thailand or Brazil. As you might imagine, that chicken will pass through many hands — sometimes literally — before it ends up on the prongs of your fork here in Britain.Worse still, the meat will often be partially processed somewhere along that chain — usually with salt and water added to boost flavour and volume — which is quite legal.          Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat However, what you can do is avoid processed foods and never buy ready mealsAt various stages of the process, it is very easy for someone to do something they shouldn\u0027t. With so many possible opportunities to interfere with the product it is enormously difficult to police the problem and, in particular, to identify who is responsible for any contamination.Although it is harder to pass off other meats as chicken, there is no doubt lamb — which is expensive — is often boosted by adding a cheaper meat such as beef, or worse still, horse. And of course, the more meat is processed — such as mincing it — the easier it is to disguise.This sort of activity has all the ethical bankruptcy of the drug dealer who cuts his cocaine with some other white powder in order to boost the quantity of his product and therefore his bottom line. Many will remember the horse meat scandal of five years ago, when many products in British and Irish supermarkets were found to contain horse. In one instance, all the meat in a Findus beef lasagne was found to have come from horses rather than cattle.At the time, the then prime minister, David Cameron, promised to get tough on what he called a \u0027very shocking crime\u0027, but that was little more than fine words. In truth, apart from a few arrests, nothing substantial happened.If anything, things got worse, which brings me to the second part of the problem — the spinelessness of food regulation in this country.           One-hundred-forty-five items out of 665 tested as part of a Food Standards Agency (FSA) report contained animal DNA that was not listed on the packagingIn the past, there was a comprehensive system of monitoring undertaken by the FSA and local Trading Standards officers, who would mount regular inspections of restaurants, takeaways, abattoirs, and indeed any form of food processing plant or food supplier.But that system is in crisis. In 2011, the FSA inspected 2,917 abattoirs and cutting plants. In 2017, it visited just 1,725 — a fall of just over 40 per cent. The FSA says this is because of a cut in funding. If that is indeed the case, then how hollow David Cameron\u0027s words seem today.Anecdotally, I hear FSA inspections are treated almost as a joke by many in the industry. As soon as inspectors arrive at a meat plant, an anodyne announcement will come over the Tannoy, saying something like, \u0027A set of keys has been found next to the drinks machine\u0027. This will be a coded instruction for employees swiftly to hide anything untoward.With fewer and less effective inspections, the FSA is essentially relying on whistleblowers to do its work. It has set up an organisation called the National Food Crime Unit, a new law enforcement agency which was established in the wake of the horse meat scandal. However, its funding appears pitiful, with the FSA board approving a mere £2.1 million for next year.So with inadequate monitoring and enforcement, what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves when we buy meat?The first thing to realise is that this really does matter. Those most obviously affected are followers of religions that prohibit the eating of certain types of meat. There is a serious issue if Hindus who don\u0027t eat beef are being given it instead of lamb, or if Muslims and Jews are being tricked into buying dishes containing pork.If you don\u0027t follow one of these religions then you may not think it a problem that you are accidentally eating a different type of meat. However, believing the tainted meat scandal is something you can safely ignore would be a mistake — there can be no doubt that businesses that tell porkers about their meat will also cut costs with food hygiene and safety.Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat — and besides, that would ruin the relaxing fun of going out for a meal.However, what you can do is avoid processed foods. Never buy ready meals. Stay away from burgers made in factories. Don\u0027t go to chain restaurants where the provenance of their meat is all-but impossible to establish.Instead go to local, independent restaurants where it is more likely the chef and owner — often the same person — cares about where the meat comes from, and will be happy to tell you. Try to buy your meat from a good local butcher.And no, what I am suggesting is not going to hurt your purse or wallet. It is a myth that supermarkets and chain restaurants are always better value than their independent competitors. With High Streets around the country struggling, it\u0027s also a great way to support your local community.The essence, then, is to buy meat that has had as small a journey from field to fork as possible, because that is the only way you can be sure of what you eat. It\u0027s that simple. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/18/4FB4173500000578-0-image-m-14_1536167841144.jpg","title":"Russian oligarchs living mansions Britain face crackdown dirty money","story":"    Dozens of Russian oligarchs in Britain are set to have their assets seized in the wake of the Salisbury revelations.

While the figures are starkest among younger people, in every age group the biggest group are those identifying with no religion.‘We know that views are becoming more socially liberal. With growing numbers belonging to no religion, faith leaders will no doubt be considering how to better connect to a changing society.’ The steepest fall in those saying they were part of the CofE was among people aged 45 to 54, with the level dropping from 35 per cent to 11 per cent from 2002 to last year.In the same period, those aged 18 to 24 saying they had no religion rose from 56 to 70 per cent.In response to the report, Dave Male, CofE director of evangelism and discipleship, said: ‘The headline figure here only gives us part of the picture. It has been clear for some time that we have moved from an era of people automatically classifying themselves as Church of England or Anglican to one in which identifying with a faith is an active choice.          The number of people who are faithful is higher than figures suggest, according to the church, whose leaders said younger people to not select a denomination ‘People are less aware of denominations. Yet research shows an increase in willingness to engage in faith. People of all ages have not stopped searching for meaning and answers in their life.’ Church officials said 1.1million people go to a CofE church to pray during a typical month. There are also 1.2million followers each month who pray online.The attitudes survey found the numbers holding allegiance to non-Christian religions has risen from 2 per cent in 1983 to 8 per cent in 2017.The report does not break this down but the 2011 census gave the total for Muslims in England and Wales as 2.71million and 817,000 for Hindus.

On Saturday, Wave will be unveiled at the IWM North in Manchester, and remain on display until 25 November, while Weeping Window can be seen at IWM London from 5 October until 18 November.A book, including striking images charting the journey of the poppies from installation at the tower through to the end of their UK tour as part of 14-18 NOW, is being published this week.Diane Lees, the director general of IWM, said the installation at the Daniel Libeskind IWM North building would look “completely stunning”.“This amazing building is built as a configuration called Shattered Earth. The shards are a planet broken apart by conflict. So to have something as symbolic as the poppy wave over the building is just the perfect sign off to the first world war centenary,” she said.Both installations have looked different at every site. Now gifted to the IWM, there are plans for a permanent display, as well as a mobile display that can be easily shipped overseas for future commemorations and events. “There is huge international interest in them,” Lees said.“They are such a phenomenon. I cannot think of another example where the public and nation have got behind a single art installation in that way. So, it is not surprising that there is interest, particularly from the Commonwealth countries to share something of that narrative.”She added: “You can imagine at every anniversary having the poppies out on display. They are going to become part of Remembrance going forward. So I think they have an amazing legacy.”The artist Paul Cummins said the public reaction to the artwork had been “incredible, something quite beyond what I ever expected, and it has been a journey for myself seeing people’s interactions with Wave and Weeping Window at the various locations around the UK”. The designer Tom Piper said: “With Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red we wanted to create something different – something that represented the tragic loss of life but also the spirit and energy embodied by the people who died in conflict.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8092560af490fd6333887d31f3d0679b5e2cc2fe/65_517_2387_1432/master/2387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d082e2e778d0cbfe4113ac4fc0475800","title":"photographer tony vaccaro in pictures","story":"The Pennsylvania-born photographer Michael A ‘Tony’ Vaccaro is best known for the powerful images he took in Europe during and after the second world war.

Her insights, though recorded during times so different from our era of unrepentant celebration and moral vigilantism, feel unsparingly true, and are expressed with musicality. To choose one at random: “A genius may indeed go to his grave unread, but he will hardly have gone to it upraised. Sweet, bland commendations fall everywhere upon the scene.” For the present age, we should add “awards” to “commendations”.The book that changed my lifeSince life is change, how to claim that it changes at one moment and not another? All the “life-changing” books I read as a teenager I have forgotten. Books advertised as “life-changing” I avoid as I would a new vitamin or holiday package. There are books, poems, and essays that have opened my eyes though. DH Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers made me see that great themes are of secondary importance to the writer what is of primary interest is the accident of existence. “Nothing is important but life,” he said in “Why the Novel Matters”, and Sons and Lovers is for me the first modern work that declares this unapologetically. The great critical essays in Tom Paulin’s Minotaur: Poetry and the Nation-State were published at a time when critical theory seemed to have invalidated an aesthetic response to writing. Paulin’s essays showed us with revelatory force how literary pleasure and political energy were enmeshed with each other. Finally, I have in mind Rabindranath Tagore’s essay on Bengali nursery rhymes, written in 1895, probably the first expression of modernism anywhere, in which he uses Bengali words for ‘stream of consciousness’ and argues that Bengali nursery rhymes accommodate random associations in a way that linear adult thinking doesn’t.The book that had the greatest influence on meSo many were key to my rediscovery of the city of Calcutta, with its provincial mysteries and wayward cosmopolitans – the subject of my first novel. Being in England at the time, I couldn’t find Calcutta in Calcutta itself. I had to find it in books. Those books included Sons and Lovers, Katherine Mansfield’s Collected Stories, VS Naipaul’s A House for Mr Biswas, Elizabeth Bishop’s Questions of Travel, and various others.The book I think is most underratedAll literatures outside western ones are wilfully underrated, even if they are among the most creative literary traditions in the world. Even when we’re aware of them, we see them as part of a history of ethnicity rather than of literature. The fact that we hardly know who Jibanananda Das is – he was one of the greatest and most original poets of the 20th century – is a case in point. His Naked Lonely Hand and Bengal the Beautiful are available in English translation by Joe Winter.The book that changed my mindI read James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man when I was 17 and thought it was pretentious and boring. I reread it when I was 24 and thought it was astonishing. It may not have changed my mind, but it made me realise that reading involves changing your mind.The book I wish I’d writtenAny book whose title I adore, or whose jacket holds me in thrall, but which I haven’t got round to reading is a book that I’ve begun to bring into existence. One of the reasons I never get round to reading that book, but keep rereading the title or studying the cover, is because I don’t want the actual work to impede the work I’m imagining. This is partly how my last novel, Friend of My Youth, came to be. I loved the title of the Alice Munro story so much that I kept deferring reading it. I never thought that one day I’d write it myself.The last book that made me cryI can’t recall. It must have been a poem, and it must have been joyous. I don’t know if this counts, but that whole sequence in Ritwik Ghatak’s film Komal Gandhar, in which a character is singing “akash bhara surja tara” (“the sky full of stars and sun,  the world full of life”), brought tears to my eyes. So did, long ago, the last pages of A House for Mr Biswas, when Anand receives his father Mr Biswas’s letter: “It was a letter full of delights.”The last book that made me laughThe collected English writings of the great 20th- century Bengali-language writer Buddhadeva Bose have just been published. I should declare an interest: I wrote the preface. Rereading it, I find myself smiling at various things. Here is the opening sentence of ‘To Remember is to Live Again’, his essay on meeting Henry Miller in America: “There was a time when I was marooned in a women’s college in Pittsburgh.”The book I’m most ashamed not to have readSome of the really terrific books I’m asked to write endorsements for and don’t have time to look at.My earliest reading memoryLadybird books.

Tax evasion, illicit financial networks, parasitic elites and many of the other subjects of this ambitious book are not new, Bullough admits: “Wealthy people have always tried to keep their money out of the hands of government.” More recently, the global growth in secrecy and criminality made possible by modern capitalism and the end of Soviet communism have become such mainstream topics that this year they were given their own primetime TV drama, BBC1’s McMafia, which was loosely based on a successful investigative book by Misha Glenny.Finally, there is the problem of description. Corrupt rulers and organised crime bosses tend to have predictable tastes. When Bullough visits one of Yanukovych’s palaces shortly after Putin’s ally was deposed, he finds “fountains … waterfalls … statues … exotic pheasants. It was a temple of tastelessness, a cathedral of kitsch”. In Bullough’s weary cataloguing and alliteration there is already a kind of defeat.The book picks up once he stops describing and starts explaining. Bullough’s underlying aim is to anatomise the “offshore” economy: the growing maze of tax havens and shell companies and legal blind spots that in recent decades has hugely damaged many relatively poor countries such as Ukraine, and benefited rich places such as the City of London, while being only hazily understood by most of us.Bullough approaches his forbidding task by coming up with clear, snappy metaphors for the offshore world and how it works. He explains them, and then deploys them again and again, like catchphrases or portentous images in a novel. The central one is “Moneyland”. He conceives of it as a secret, parallel world, almost like something from a fairytale: “The very wealthiest people … have tunnelled into this new land that lies beneath all our nation states, where borders have vanished. They move their money … and themselves wherever they wish, picking and choosing which countries’ laws they wish to live by.”Passports are sold to the rich by small countries hungry for income, such as Malta and the Caribbean federation of St Kitts and Nevis. The process is euphemistically advertised by middlemen as “citizenship by investment”. While most adults pay taxes, in Moneyland the rich minimise their contribution by setting up trusts, often based in Jersey – another pretty and secretive island. While many businesses remain tangible, regulated entities, in Moneyland opaque shell companies are formed and reformed so\u0026nbspquickly that even the most powerful states can’t keep track of them and their assets. In 2017, the US Government Accountability Office found that “the US government had no idea who owned ... one-third of the buildings” it “leased for high-security purposes”.Bullough’s concise, confident book is full of such jaw-dropping examples. It also covers a lot of historical ground. A single early chapter describes the anarchic, elite-driven nature of the world economy of the early 20th century – a less technologically advanced version of today’s – which led ultimately to the Great Depression and fascism then the more regulated and stable economy that replaced it, from the mid-40s to the mid-70s and then the ways in which it was deliberately destabilised again by ingenious bankers in Switzerland and the City, to the benefit of furtive wealthy interests.Some of this narrative is a bit too neat. The political forces for and against offshore capitalism, and how they ebbed and flowed during the 20th century are scarcely mentioned. Instead, as if narrating a documentary, Bullough sometimes searches too self-consciously for colourful characters and locations.But more often his busy and determined reporting from the Caribbean, eastern and western Europe and the US – south-east Asia and the Middle East feature perhaps less than they should – produces memorable and telling scenes. In balmy Nevis, an official of the government’s Financial Services Regulatory Commission responds to his questions, about the use of the island’s extensive banking secrecy laws by “corrupt foreign officials”, with a denial that sounds both legally impregnable and inadvertently revealing: “I can’t tell\u0026nbspyou that I accept that there have been multiple usages of our structures to facilitate whatever.”Later, on St Kitts, Bullough visits an elderly seller of spare car parts, a former local politician who for decades has kept minutes of cabinet meetings he attended in “yellow and pink cardboard folders” at the back of his shop. In one of these, Bullough reads: “Ministers agreed that a passport should cost … $50,000 plus a ‘substantial fee’.”He is surprisingly successful at getting some of the architects of the offshore world to open up, and is sensitive to the fact that some of its users have good reason to avoid governments, such as rich dissidents fearing the politically motivated confiscation of their assets. He also accepts an argument frequently put to\u0026nbsphim in notorious tax havens: that wealthier, less criticised countries such as Britain have been equally involved in building and maintaining Moneyland. In London’s hugely expensive Eaton Square alone, he discovers, there are 86 properties owned through “anonymous structures”.What is to be done about any or all of this? Despite the book’s rousing subtitle, Bullough perhaps predictably devotes only a few pages to this difficult topic. As he writes with typical pithiness: “Money flows across frontiers, but laws do not.” Until this situation changes, the lawyers, bankers and drafters of deliberately loose financial laws will continue to prosper. Meanwhile, governments will continue to be starved of revenue, global inequality will grow, economies will be destabilised and struggling voters will blame everyone – poor immigrants, liberal elites – except those actually responsible for creating the destructive offshore world.Bullough’s book is pacy, clever and far more entertaining than you’d expect of a work on this subject. Sometimes it moves so fast you suspect that nervous lawyers have been involved. At other times, you wish he’d written about the offshore manoeuvrings of tax-averse mainstream corporations as well. But if you still have any illusions about the wonders of liberated capitalism, Moneyland will probably cure you.• Moneyland is published by Profile.

He said the takeover would make it better able to “champion the pleasures of real bookshops in the face of Amazon’s siren call”.He said: “We are honoured to be entrusted with the Foyles business, and greatly look forward to joining forces with the Foyles bookselling team.” The sale brings down the curtain on one of Britain’s most famous bookselling dynasties, with Foyles most famous for its Charing Cross Road branch in London, which in 2014 moved into the former St Martin’s School of Art building.The value of the deal has not been disclosed. Foyles was controlled by its Monaco-based chairman, Christopher Foyle, the grandson of one of the founders.“My family and I are delighted that Foyles is entering a new chapter, one which secures the brand’s future and protects its personality,” Foyle said. “I look forward to witnessing the exciting times ahead for the company founded by my grandfather and his brother 115 years ago.”In recent times Foyles has struggled to turn a profit amid challenging trading conditions on the high street. The retailer posted a loss of £88,791 for the year to 30 June 2017 after the number of shoppers visiting its stores declined after the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. The rise of Amazon has had a dramatic impact on the high street book trade, with the number of independent book shops halving to 858 since the US retailer’s UK launch two decades ago.With 283 shops Waterstones, which also owns Hatchards, is Britain’s biggest book chain. It was recently sold to the hedge fund Elliott Advisors. In addition to Charing Cross Road, Foyles, which was founded in 1903, has three other shops in London – Royal Festival Hall, Waterloo and Westfield Stratford. It also has branches in Bristol, Birmingham and Chelmsford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a693f25bea0faaf3652b986daf718e184142f5cf/0_97_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48398586d998dcaa948dfdee3efbbcf3","title":"ofgems energy price cap could be a muddle that satisfies no one","story":"Think of the price cap as a command to companies to shed costs – meaning jobsLet’s be generous to the Ofgem chief, Dermot Nolan. He’s produced a respectable fudge, as he was told to. Parliament gave him the tricky job of setting an energy price cap at a level that prevents “rip-off” pricing but still encourages customers to switch suppliers, goals that pull in opposite directions. A figure of £1,136 – being the proposed upper limit for a standard variable tariff for a typical dual-fuel customer – looks as good a stab as any.It’s slightly embarrassing that the average saving of £75 for punters on default deals is lower than the £100 that Theresa May had unwisely trumpeted. But wholesale energy prices move all the time, so the more relevant figure is the overall savings to consumers, which Ofgem put at £1bn, or slightly more than the big six made in profits last year. Think of the price cap, then, as a command to companies to shed costs, meaning jobs.Will it even be temporary? The official script says the price cap will stay until 2023 at the latest while Ofgem develops policies “to make the energy market more competitive and work better for all consumers”. Since Nolan’s predecessors comprehensively failed on that score, it’s asking a lot to believe a magical formula will now appear. Note that neither Ofgem nor the government has defined the criteria for lifting the cap, which is an enormous oversight. One suspects price caps could last longer than advertised at the outset.If so, some will applaud since it’s definitely true that the big six invited intervention by gouging their inattentive customers. But it is also entirely unproven that price caps will act as the intended sharp shock that “resets” the market. They may just produce a different sort of muddle that satisfies nobody – certainly not customers who followed the sound advice to pay attention and shop around.There is, though, a hole that we already knew about: the costs of doing the deal. Transaction costs totalled £126m in Thursday’s half-year figures, of which only £54m related to charges on bank borrowings. The bulk of the rest comprised fees to assorted lawyers, accountants and City advisers. In mitigation, one could say there was a large success-related element, a plea that was not available to the GKN side, where £107m was clocked up during an unsuccessful defence. The money-pot for advisers isn’t fresh news, but the figures remain astonishing.One extension to help to buy, introduced by George Osborne in 2013, is not enough for the housebuilders. They’re already lobbying for another, to take the scheme beyond 2021. This is entirely unsurprising given that subsidies for house-buyers have had a wondrous effect of builders’ profit margins.But at least Greg Fitzgerald, the boss of Bovis Homes, realises the game changed when the Persimmon chief, Jeff Fairburn, got a £75m bonus from an incentive scheme pumped up by help to buy. Any extension, says Fitzgerald, is bound to come with rules “to stop you bastard chief executives earning all this money from government subsidies”, as he puts it. Let’s hope so. After the Persimmon fiasco, anything else would be a disgrace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d9565657d0d123b25008e6b6e3088dc68d616e/175_121_1825_1095/master/1825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e2696f39e0dc1727bafb46a481e35ca","title":"good pub guide britains boozers food","story":"Do not judge the Good Pub Guide (GPG) too harshly: it needs to sell books in a tough market. You may call the confected controversy that accompanied the release of the travel guide’s 37th edition trolling. The GPG would call it PR.Effective PR, too, given that its headline claim – that pub-goers are suffering a pandemic of pretentious “MasterChef-mad” food – was widely reported. So excitedly reported, in fact, that people such as me (a food writer who cares about pubs, grub and the truth) may feel compelled to set the record straight, despite this offering yet more publicity for the GPG.Its main claim is that its baffled readership have had enough of: “Eating kabsa, katsuobushi, matbucha, succotash, tataki or verjus in a pub. We don’t want our dishes adorned with carrot fluff, edible sand or fish ‘foam’. Leave that to swanky restaurants.”The Little Englander tone is depressing. The average British regular may not want to eat Saudi Arabian rice dishes (kabsa) or dried fermented tuna (katsuobushi), but curry nights are a pub staple nationwide and a significant minority of UK pubs contain Thai and Chinese restaurants. Are pub-goers more adventurous than the average GPG correspondent? Possibly.Moreover, this pearl-clutching idea that British pubs are overrun with “wacky” food is cobblers. A quick Google of “edible sand” brings up an old menu at Scawton’s Hare Inn, but scant other pub references. The Hare is a tasting-menus-only venue. A restaurant. No one would mistake it for a local boozer. The “carrot fluff” I can only trace to the New Forest’s Three Tuns Inn, a pub of otherwise solidly (burger, fish and chips, steak and kidney pie) mainstream credentials. That carrot fluff is just that. Fluff. A linguistic flourish.None of this constitutes an epidemic of impenetrable food, as you will know if you have ever been to a pub – or ever left the house. This British high street is not really the GPG’s territory (its realm is more polished, Farrow \u0026amp Ball-hued rural inns), but it is worth remembering that the vast majority of UK chain pubs serve ultra-predictable menus of bought-in, quick-assembly, microwaveable food at super-low prices. No fish foam. No tataki. Plenty of 2-for-1 steak nights.But even in the rarefied realms of the (cough!) gastropub, where restaurant-quality food is the aim, the GPG’s claim bears little scrutiny. Nationally, the number of genuinely cutting-edge foodie destinations located in old pubs (for instance, West Yorkshire’s Moorcock Inn or the Michelin-starred Sportsman in Kent), is vanishingly small. And good luck to them. When 18 pubs are closing each week, this is a great way to repurpose those buildings.More broadly, even pubs with la-di-da chefs at the helm are keen to be democratic these days. You can spend big at Cumbria’s Pentonbridge Inn (run by ex-oppos of Marcus Wareing) or Essex’s Flitch of Bacon (a spin-off from the two-Michelin-star Midsummer House), but you can also sit in the bar and eat a gussied-up steak sandwich, fish cakes, suet pudding or ham hock on toast. This year, having lost its Michelin star, Devon’s Treby Arms ditched its tasting menus. It now serves casual Italian food. That is the direction of travel.In its plea for “honest pub grub” (a problematic concept), the GPG hymns its value pub of the year, the Old Castle in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, for its hearty homemade classics such as fish pie. It sounds great. But is it part of a dying breed? No. From London’s Marksman to Cumbria’s Punch Bowl Inn via Chester’s Brewery Tap, the majority of pubs seeking to serve good food are – from plates of wood pigeon, liver toast and hedgerow jelly to black pudding, fried egg and bubble’n’squeak – doing so in an identifiably British pub idiom. One that, at its best, also embraces modern methods and global food styles. At Lancashire’s Parker’s Arms, for instance, its lauded pies come with a side order of Lebanese-French influences from its chef, Stosie Madi.To me, a pub menu in 2018 should contain precisely that hint of excitement. The menu should be as fluid as the pub itself. It should contain enough staples so that it is familiar and affordable (circa £11), but, as at Sedbergh’s Black Bull (beetroot bourguignon and ewe’s curd venison pastilla), it should tempt you from your comfort zone. You should be able to drop in for a pint and end up on an adventure. In a pub, I can even tolerate that fine dining frippery, an amuse-bouche, if – as at Derbyshire’s Boot Inn – it is delivered with zero pomp. The talented chef, Rob Taylor, also serves an A1 burger.It is the best of both worlds. Although Taylor’s quail ballotine with bacon jam would blow the Good Pub Guide’s tiny mind.• Tony Naylor is a journalist who writes about food"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db48ab50001e530d7a733e1d5c186dbd9f993395/0_144_3208_1925/master/3208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b81a18d9ed2a07c314c924145c18ab6d","title":"womens equality party politics sophie walker","story":"The party’s leader is right to eschew clickbait politics. But Sophie Walker needs to find a way to get her message acrossSomething has snapped. In Good and Mad, her new book on female anger, the American writer Rebecca Traister argues that a long-suppressed fury seething under the surface of women’s lives is finally breaking through and changing the nature of political debate. You can feel it in the air, a sort of fierce crackling impatience with the status quo for women, which has helped to fuel everything from abortion law reform in Ireland and the pussy protests against Trump to the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment.Younger women clearly aren’t prepared to put up with what their mothers endured. But many older women too are raging over everything from changes to the state pension age to a trans rights movement that some fear is riding roughshod over vulnerable women’s concerns. They feel ignored or taken for granted by the political parties they have supported all their lives.The puzzle is that the one political party founded precisely to cater for women who feel like this is not reaping the rewards. Theoretically, this could be a breakthrough moment for the Women’s Equality party the point where female frustration fuses with the desire of politically homeless moderate voters for a “none of the above” option on the ballot paper to create something new and potentially explosive. Yet for reasons that anyone currently thinking about setting up a breakaway party would do well to consider, the revolution appears to be a long time coming.Today in Kettering, the WE launches its annual party conference, the undeniably catchy pitch for which is “Does the current state of politics makes you despair?” The theme is turning a year of marches and protests into action – deeds not words, as the suffragettes had it – and the programme evokes nostalgia for the days when politics was at least occasionally still about things like the failure to convict rapists or fixing a broken social care system, rather than fighting over the right to say offensive things about Jews.They’re not avoiding the big issues: there’s a session on how Brexit could set women back and the party leader, Sophie Walker, will come out for a People’s Vote. But they’re acknowledging that these aren’t the only things going on in women’s lives, with sessions on everything from why shared parental leave works in Iceland but hasn’t really taken off here, to single mothers’ anger at unpaid child support being written off as too expensive to collect. Tickets have sold out. So why is membership plateauing at 45,000 after an initial rush of enthusiasm?It’s never easy for new parties to break through in first-past-the-post systems, but WE was founded three years ago on the understanding that it didn’t actually need to. If Ukip could force its agenda on the main parties without getting a single MP elected, maybe it could do the same with feminist ideas regarded as too expensive or controversial for the mainstream to embrace, like universal free childcare.Like all small parties, its first problem has been simply getting heard. Nigel Farage’s solution was to throw a metaphorical brick through the nation’s window, by saying something outrageous whenever the ratings were flagging. But the whole ethos of WE is rejecting macho slanging matches for a deeper, more serious examination of women’s lives. It is to Walker’s credit that she won’t engage in clickbait politics – but in terms of media coverage, also to her disadvantage. Her party finds itself in the classic bind of the woman at a meeting who strives earnestly to listen and understand everyone else’s point of view, only to be ruthlessly talked over by those with no such qualms.It has struggled too with deep and often generational ides within feminism itself. Walker was reportedly booed at one meeting of Woman’s Place, the group founded to debate the impact on other women of expanding trans women’s rights, for saying she wanted to listen to both sides – and mauled by Mumsnetters on the same issue. She comes across as rather hopelessly trying to keep all sides happy in a debate where that is no longer possible. And yet she is right that there are no easy answers.There are frightened people on both sides of the debate who genuinely feel their rights and safety are under threat. Striking a balance between them will take time, understanding and more listening than shouting. The same is true of a myriad of issues in contemporary politics, including Brexit, but in a bitterly polarised climate that’s not what people want to hear. So many voters say that what we want is grownup, rational, coolly evidence-based politics when in practice what we respond to is often raw tribal emotion.But I wonder if the deeper problem isn’t that voters find WE slightly confusing. It pitches itself as neither right nor left nor in the middle, but above conventional party politics altogether reasonably enough, Walker argues that feminism is a radical ideology in and of itself, not a subset of some other political tradition. But in practice that refusal to pick a recognisable side is all too easily confused with lack of conviction, mushiness or a desire to sit on the fence.And while it’s not a classic centrist party, that makes WE an intriguing illustration of the single biggest challenge facing any new party that might emerge from Labour’s struggle to the death or from inside the Tories’ great Brexit schism. Somehow, it would need to get across the idea that moderate centre ground beliefs are more than just a way of splitting the difference between two extremes that they’re a creed in their own right, held as passionately as any other, and as capable of being a force for change. It ought to be possible to be both moderate and angry, outraged yet still capable of responding rationally to be good and mad, in all senses of the words. But as women have been finding down the ages, that is perhaps still far easier said than done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/471e55b9ae1bdf0c1f7888c0a3461a8e698c25f8/0_220_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13fdd064153f6db6cdf4b934cfc8e386","title":"burt reynolds hadley freeman","story":"I interviewed Reynolds three years ago ready to be wooed by his breezy charm. Instead, his pain, pills – and professionalism – left me deeply movedIf ever there was proof that fame does not guarantee a lifetime of happiness, then Burt Reynolds offered it up in life-size proportions. In 2015 he came to London to flog his autobiography, But Enough About Me, and I was so excited at the prospect of meeting the star of Smokey and the Bandit and Boogie Nights that I came out of maternity leave three months early to interview him for a  Live event.What other macho man had made more movies examining and undermining masculinity? And what other 70s heartthrob presented all that machismo alongside all that self-doubt? Arguably the biggest star of the 1970s – and still my mental template of how a 20th century playboy looks – I was so excited about meeting him I watched Deliverance twice.No sensible person expects a 79-year-old man to resemble the virile god he was 40 years before. But the gap between the fantasy and the reality that presented itself when I met him on that December night was so devastating I couldn’t speak for a few seconds. Reynolds always was a professional, so he gave it his charming best, doing some obligatory flirting with me, reeling out the anecdotes when the interview started, but the physical evidence was too stark to ignore. Wracked by pain from lifelong injuries, he could neither stand up straight nor walk more than five steps without reaching for his pot of pills. These, in turn, made him a little addled, and he stumbled several times as I walked him towards his seat.All interviews are exploitative to some degree, but in my 20 years of being a journalist none felt more so than this. Reynolds had just auctioned off most of his memorabilia and there were rumours of bankruptcy, which he denied. His autobiography was really just a collection of stories about his famous friends from the past – Fred Astaire, Sally Field – and the interview felt less like a celebration of Reynolds’ extraordinary career and more like he was selling his loved ones to stay afloat. Within 10 minutes, Reynolds was crying. “I’m sorry, I wanted this to be fun,” he said helplessly to the audience, trying to be an entertainer to the end.After you’ve interviewed someone it’s almost impossible to separate the person you met from their public persona, and for a few months after the interview I couldn’t even think about Reynolds without feeling almost dizzy with regret and sadness. But after a while the immediate shock of the encounter subsided into something else and what I ultimately realised was this: yes, his end was terrible, and yes, what made it even more painful how much he clearly hated being pitied.But through the pain and the pills Reynolds still came across as, yes, funny, but also thoughtful, intelligent, caring, sensitive and generous. He could still wink and flirt as easily as he could talk and cry. He might have become less than he was, but he was also always more than most people knew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e479d16982f6fd675158cfce5b0fe7ff68aa307f/0_356_5400_3242/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a956ff606443f1add8ed6b83fed5341c","title":"global soft drink firms back plan to eliminate packaging waste","story":"Industry makes biggest commitment yet to ending its use of throwaway plastic bottles Global soft drink companies have made their biggest commitment yet to eliminating the use of throwaway plastic bottles, in an action plan presented to parliament.In a report sponsored by the likes of Danone, Suntory and Nestlé, the companies give unequivocal backing to a government-implemented deposit and return scheme. Their ambition is for zero plastic packaging to be sent to landfill or escape into the natural environment by 2030, and for packaging to be made entirely from recycled or renewable materials or both.Thursday’s report, produced by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said: “Achieving this vision requires all stakeholders in the bottled water and soft drinks value chain to commit to eliminating plastic packaging waste as a strategic priority.”It comes as the government considers imposing a tax on single-use plastics that could see plastic straws banned by next year.“Leading bottled water and soft drinks companies understand that coordinated action is required across the value chain to address the challenge of plastic packaging waste from bottled water and soft drinks and to help create long-term sustainable solutions,” the report said.It calls on government to reform the producer responsibility scheme – a formula through which companies are supposed to contribute towards recycling their products, but which has been heavily criticised.And the firms want all revenue from a new scheme and a deposit return system to be reinvested in recycling and reprocessing of plastic packaging. They say a significant shift in consumer behaviour is also required.Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner for Greenpeace, welcomed the move. “Some of the world’s largest food companies now recognise the huge environmental impacts single-use plastic bottles are having on our marine environment,” she said.“And it’s positive to see major businesses backing a fully comprehensive deposit return schemes for drinks containers and acknowledging that they should also cut the amount of throwaway plastic they churn out. What we need to see now is real investment in the solutions and ambitious targets for plastic packaging reduction and reuse. With nearly 500bn plastic bottles being produced globally every year and just a few of them being recycled, action cannot come a moment too soon.”Annual consumption of plastic bottles is set to top half a trillion by 2021.

The animals are known to live in suburban areas in the region, but these are isolated and at risk. “If we get lots of winter flooding, during hibernation, you potentially wipe out a large area of hedgehog population, and if there is not a local population that can repopulate the area, you get an area that is desolate,” Williams said.Badger numbers have roughly doubled since 1992, when they gained increased legal protection, although the population is probably still lower than in the historical past. But the new data suggests that badger numbers would have to rise sixfold from current levels to wipe out hedgehogs completely. “Badgers and hedgehogs can, and do, coexist, as was the case historically for thousands of years,” said Williams.Hugh Warwick, at the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, said the research showed the value of back gardens as a refuge: “This fascinating piece of research reminds us of how vital a habitat our back gardens can be and one we can easily improve with a few small actions. The most important is to ensure that hedgehogs can get into your garden, and a small hole – 13cm – will do.”While the intensification of agriculture since the 1950s has seen much habitat destroyed, more than 30,000km of hedgerows have been planted or restored in the last 20 years, according to the National Farmers’ Union. Pesticide use, which can kill the invertebrates that hedgehogs and badgers feed on, has been declining since 1990, the NFU says.Williams welcomed these changes, but said it could take 20 years or more before they led to an increase in mature, valuable habitat: “It is likely we are not seeing some of the benefit of these changes immediately.”He added: “However, I think there is a wider societal issue. Farmers get quite a raw deal and are blamed for lots of the habitat loss, whereas as a society we have decided we want lots of fairly cheap food and and we are not prepared to pay a premium for food that is farmed in a more environmentally way. As a society, we have to choose if we are prepared to pay that premium so we can have food alongside the benefit of a good environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e537961e70bb6b47064fa0a75e4c427119c9a1f/0_124_1915_1148/master/1915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=786adf367bb8a60f6cbe53b37e042098","title":"london fashion week vows to be fur free","story":"British Fashion Council says LFW in September will be first of big fashion weeks to ditch animal furLondon has become the first of the main fashion weeks to ditch animal fur in its shows after the British Fashion Council (BFC) said none of the designers participating on the official schedule would be using it.The BFC made the announcement after carrying out a survey asking designers if they planned on using fur in their shows, and comes after rising numbers of anti-fur protesters demonstrating at London fashion week (LFW), from 25 in 2016 to more than 250 last September.One such brand is Burberry, which announced it had implemented a fur-free policy before the debut of its new creative director, Riccardo Tisci, at LFW, with all remaining fur items being phased out. “I don’t think it is compatible with modern luxury and with the environment in which we live, and Riccardo has a very strong view as well on this,” its chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, told the Business of Fashion. “It’s part of what Burberry is today.”Wendy Higgins, the director of international media at Humane Society International UK, said the organisation first met Burberry almost a decade ago to urge the company to drop fur.“Most British consumers don’t want anything to do with the cruelty of fur and so this is absolutely the right decision by this quintessentially British brand. And as fashion week kicks off in New York, Burberry’s compassionate stance couldn’t have come at a better time, sending a strong message to designers like Prada still using fur, who are looking more and more isolated and outdated by the day.”This week, the animal rights group Peta published an open letter by the singer Paloma Faith to the BFC’s recently appointed chair, Stephanie Phair, asking her to take a stand on behalf of the organisation and introduce a fur-free policy.“The BFC shouldn’t be endorsing a material whose production is deemed so cruel that it is outlawed in the UK,” she wrote, referring to the ban on fur farming which was implemented in the UK in 2003, despite the import of animal fur remaining legal.Rush says although “as an organisation we believe in the rights of people and animals and encourage designers to make ethical choices”, the BFC has not implemented a complete ban as it does “not define or control the creative process of the designers” showing their collections. “Using fur is not illegal in the UK and it needs to come down to the choice of both the designer and ultimately the consumer.”The survey is a part of the BFC’s positive fashion initiative, designed to encourage designers and business to consider sustainability, equality and ersity, and craftsmanship and community in their processes. Rush says its results show the industry is “seeing a cultural change based on ideals and choices made within brands”.“The fur dialogue is ongoing and the stance of brands such as Burberry, Stella McCartney, Gucci, Yoox Net-A-Porter, Versace and Vivienne Westwood, among others, to look at alternative options to fur will encourage more brands to consider what options are available to them.”Concerns surrounding the environmental impact of sourcing alternatives to animal fur, such as synthetic faux fur, continue to be one of the most pressing issues to stem from the shift by the industry. After news that Helsinki fashion week was banning leather last month, Rachael Stott, the senior creative researcher at The Future Laboratory, told the  “animal-free doesn’t automatically mean guilt-free”.“Currently there is currently no safe way to produce or dispose of PVC products, therefore consumers can be misled into thinking ‘vegan’ is entirely environmentally friendly.”In an effort to help designers trace their fabric supply chain, the BFC established the British high-end manufacturers database in 2017, an open-source directory that helps them “gain ethical supply-chain certificates and facilitate successful relationships between designers and production units”.Many high-profile fashion businesses have recently distanced themselves from the animal product.

From 1978 to 1982, Burt Reynolds in all his easygoing ruggedness was the undisputed king: the industry’s top grossing star every year in that time for increasingly unfashionable but lucrative pictures. It was a short but legendary reign, after which his awful career moves, calamitous personal investments and matrimonial woes put his star into the descendant. But, like Travolta, he enjoyed a hip and postmodern comeback in the 1990s as the porn movie mogul in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights (1997), a role with a streak of darkness which reconnected to him to the disturbing John Boorman picture that made his name in 1972, Deliverance, the story of four white salarymen who go on a trip to the Georgia wilderness, unwisely patronise the locals and encounter a situation which unlocks ruthless violence in Reynolds’s character.But Deliverance – however sensational it was – was a slightly atypical role for Reynolds. In his glorious, sunlit heyday, Burt Reynolds was an easygoing figure. He had a wide, handsome and very intelligent face: sometimes accessorised with a big moustache, he appeared in an outdoors-guy leather, denim, sometimes in lawman’s uniform or sports kit — the kind of rangy look that was later co-opted by the gay community. Reynolds had a fine singing voice and appeared opposite Dolly Parton in the musical The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, and in 1973 released a country album called Ask Me What I Am.What indeed? Burt Reynolds wasn’t exactly an action star, nor a comic, nor a romantic lead, but he could play all of those, and had a strong line in gallantry. Reynolds basically played a character usually relegated to second billing: the good ol’ boy, who loved beers, girls, sports and especially cars – often racing them against the cops, in that utterly vanished kind of action comedy where dozens of squad cars are in pursuit of one lovably roguish scamp. And Reynolds could as well play the police officer as the roguish outlaw. In some ways, Burt Reynolds was a cross between Steve McQueen and the Elvis Presley who appeared in dozens of his own indistinguishable movie vehicles. While the 1970s were promoting newer, more cerebral, less macho stars like Woody Allen and Dustin Hoffman, Reynolds was a holdout, an unapologetic man’s man.In movies like Smokey and the Bandit, and The Cannonball Run (with their various sequels) or WW and the Dixie Dance Kings, Reynolds popularised like no other actor that twinkly-eyed male star, with a touch of the rebel. And as he himself was a former college football player, he was a very convincing star of football movies like The Longest Yard and Semi-Tough. Reynolds loved to work with the people that he trusted, again and again, in the kind of material that he felt comfortable with, and he directed a handful of features in which he starred. But his career was not well managed. There were rumours that he had turned down everything from Star Wars to Pretty Woman finally, he wasn’t even being considered for the interesting roles, and arguably did not find a way to develop as a character actor. However unfairly, some in the industry felt that there was something one-note in Reynolds’s acting style which wasn’t ageing well.Perhaps no serious role could possibly match up to the extraordinary impact of Deliverance. The male rape scene, in which the victim is told to “squeal like a pig”, and the assailant is brutally killed, has the power to shock. If it had come out in a later era, it might have coloured Reynolds’s career much more than it did: that grisly scene would be endlessly replayed on YouTube and discussed online. In the same year, Reynolds courted controversy by doing a near-nude centrefold, a move he regretted. But in that era, there were more career chances for actors – male actors that is.Reynolds was reborn in Boogie Nights in 1997 as a faintly bizarre, but weirdly charming silver-fox porn producer who has to sweet-talk Mark Wahlberg’s handsome kid into appearing in one of his dirty movies, and he has big dreams of creating a kind of pornography with a real narrative. There is a touch of tongue-in-cheek in the casting here: Reynolds, the hilariously dated 70s and 80s icon, re-emerges as a louche smoothie. But Reynolds plays it with great sangfroid, and it earned him an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win. British audiences fondly came to notice Burt Reynolds in Dolland and Aitchison ads on TV, and he managed his later years with good humour and self-deprecation. He is an icon of Hollywood of the CarterReagan years, the cannonball of old-school manliness and fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fba9e421c5466c37c579d7d46df7659a5a60ae/100_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f7d8f120cc042397d40326e6574f89e","title":"outlaw king review chris pine","story":"David Mackenzie’s follow-up to Hell or High Water gives us screams, scowls and rolling vistas – but precious little depthOnly the manliest of men make the cut for David Mackenzie’s films. The director recently trained his camera on hardened prison inmates for Starred Up and cud-chewing cowpokes in the Academy-feted Hell or High Water, two perspectives on the responsibilities and sacrifices that life thrusts on guys’ guys making their way in the world. So he’s right at home in the medieval era, where the warriors wear stony faces caked with blood and grime.Mackenzie tackles his homeland’s early 14th-century origins for Outlaw King, a massive-scale account of nobleman-turned-King of Scots Robert the Bruce’s quest to restore sovereignty and freedom to his subjects. He and his countrymen’s efforts to beat back the English goliath tread the same battle lines as everything from Braveheart to 300, but that’s hardly a problem for a director who excels at massaging detail into stock narratives. Yet his fixation on the proving grounds of manhood has curdled into something blande and simple here, and occasionally veers into the unintentionally silly. When Mackenzie unveils the full-frontal form of his lead actor while bathing in a stream, it feels a bit like he’s trying to prove something.That lead actor is Chris Pine, who infuses the Bruce with old-fashioned masculine ideals of honour and principle. He treats the ladies right, abstaining from sex on the night of his marriage to hardy Elizabeth (Florence Pugh, excellent despite her thankless role), waiting until she feels she’s ready. The film begins as he pledges his fealty to his new overlords for the sake of the people, yielding his dignity in the hope that it might put an end to the conflict.When it becomes clear that surrender will not stop the English invaders from harassing the townspeople, Robert makes the tough choice to launch an against-all-odds rebellion. Their nemesis, Edward, Prince of Wales (Billy Howle) is everything a drill sergeant tries to grind out of a new recruit: petulant, underhanded, disrespectful and weak. Mackenzie is at his best when immersing himself in the well-researched nitty-gritty of the Middle Ages, staging a wedding, a funeral and a knighting ceremony with what he promised was absolute fidelity in a quick introduction prior to the premiere here. The opulent garb does look distinct from the usual period-piece costuming and snatches of old-world working songs add to a hard-earned sense of verisimilitude. Steadicam shots move freely from indoors to out, mapping humongous and exhaustively created sets. During the scenes of strategising, in which Robert must navigate the vendettas and egos of his fellow Scotsmen as he rallies them to his cause, the process-obsessed director is at his best.But that particular Mackenzie is regrettably inconspicuous for the lion’s share of the film. His previous films have been tighter and more polished than this one, which also contains – once Elizabeth has sufficiently warmed to her husband – a hilariously miscalculated sex scene that gives the buttock gyrations from The Room a run for their money.As James Douglas, Robert’s loyal right-hand man, Aaron Taylor-Johnson disrupts every scene in which he appears with an entirely new breed of bad acting, forged from incoherent screaming and po-faced monotone. And how could a movie with such an evidently hefty budget not produce passable CGI?If the historical epic exists as a delivery system for swords-and-shields clashes, panoramas of rolling natural vistas and gruff inspirational speeches to those about to die, then Mackenzie has done his job and then some. But his prior films have set the bar a bit higher than that, and this straightforward, unchallenged take on macho valour doesn’t quite reach it. Despite all the pained faces, this script gives Robert the Bruce no more depth than a paragraph in a history textbook.Mackenzie has previously searched for nobility in crooks and bank robbers. Here, when his main character asserts himself as a conventional hero at every available opportunity, the joy of the hunt is lost altogether.•\u0026nbspOutlaw King has premiered at the Toronto film festival.

She must have been about 80. I took a four-hour bus journey from Mexico City to her eco ranch in Michoacán on the west coast to interview her. I arrived around 3pmand she met me at the gate with a glass of mezcal.She showed me her garden: there were chillies, corn, tomatillos and coffee beans. Her larder was brimming with chutneys, chilli pastes and vinegars made with fruits such as pineapple and guava.Mexicans are obsessed with vinegar – you need sharp acidic dressings for slaws and salsas to offset all those lovely slow-cooked gelatinous braises. Diana is a big environmentalist she had a composting looand a solar-powered oven. At around 4.30, she brought out some very fine bone china, a pot of darjeeling and cake. It was extraordinary to meet this very British woman living in the middle of the Mexican jungle.Diana was brought up in Essex, but has lived in Mexico for at least 50 years. She has written several very thick tomes on Mexican food. Very early on, she realised how regional the food in Mexico was, which is why her first book, published in 1972, is called The Essential Cuisines of Mexico.The wealth of ingredients is astonishing. Diana would go to a state and discover a new chilli, herb or bean. She travelled around the whole country in an old pickup truck. She would arrive with a rollmat on her back and ask to speak to the best cooks in the village. She saw that a lot of women were cooking incredible dishes in these different areas, but some spoke dialects and others couldn’t write, so to preserve these recipes she started to write them down.The city of Oaxaca is famous for its mole – meaning sauce – and the most complex is a deep, black one. In the introduction to the recipe in Oaxaca al Gusto: An Infinite Gastronomy, Diana says you need four helpers and an open fire to make it. I remember thinking in exasperation: “Typical Diana to make such a fuss. How hard can it be?” I made it and it took four of us the whole weekend. She was completely right. It was incredible. These complex moles are a fine balance of sweet and savoury.The Cuisines of Mexico is probably my favourite of her books. The title encapsulates just how different the food is around the country. In each recipe’s introduction, there’s a paragraph about its creator, which brings it to life.We have a salsa on the menu at Wahaca that is inspired by a recipe in the book. It’s called salsa de tijera. You snip up ancho chillies with a pair of scissors and finely chop shallots and garlic, then let the ancho, shallots and garlic marinate in olive oil and vinegar for as long as you can. It’s very pungent, rich, red and oily. I’ve been using it for years. The book is full of these gems, and generally they are easy to make in.Diana is one of only two British people who have been given the Order of the Aztec Eagle – Mexicans revere her. When I delve into her books, I’m always inspired to cook something. She transports me to Mexico."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be596a6a57889dcdc01832f8d0c9c732b5f02ad/0_47_3896_2338/master/3896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a0d854065a9615b56db2e60744bf84a","title":"wales republic of ireland nations league match report","story":"Ryan Giggs outlined his belief that Wales can be a match for any team in the world after delivering a swashbuckling and ruthless display to secure a first victory over the Republic of Ireland in 26 years.Prior to last night Wales had only scored twice in their last seven meetings with Ireland, but they hit four goals here, three of which came in the first half, to get their Nations League campaign off to an emphatic start. Joe Allen’s pass allowed Tom Lawrence to strike first before Gareth Bale made it 10 goals in his last nine appearances for club and country with a stunning strike on 18 minutes.Aaron Ramsey and Connor Roberts added to the onslaught before Shaun Williams grabbed a goal back for the visitors.“Credit to ourselves, not many teams could have lived with us tonight. I think we’d have given anyone a game,” said Giggs after his fourth game in charge of Wales and first on home soil. “I said to the players, the bad news is you have to keep to that standard, if they drop below they are letting me and the others down. They have to keep getting better, keep improving. But tonight we enjoy it and enjoy the result.”Wales failed to break down Ireland’s stubborn defensive unit the last time these teams met but it took only six minutes for them to expose the shortcomings of Martin O’Neill’s men in that area this time around.The irrepressible Ethan Ampadu found David Brooks with a searching ball out to the right wing to start the move. The Bournemouth youngster cut it back for Joe Allen who slipped a perfectly-weighted pass in behind Ciaran Clarke for Lawrence to drill the ball past Darren Randolph.The visitors appeared to have discovered some composure but were then caught cold by Bale’s brilliance. Ben Davies picked out the Real Madrid forward with a pinpoint long ball following Callum O’Dowda’s misplaced pass and Ireland’s defence could do nothing but watch as Bale went up a gear, cut inside and curled a shot into the corner of the net.Ireland had no answer for the fast and furious approach of the men in red and had no way back after Ramsey put Giggs’ side out of sight before half-time. Ampadu won the ball back in midfield and put it on a plate for the Arsenal midfielder to beat Randolph at his near post again.The half-time team talks would have been poles apart as a seething Roy Keane, O’Neill’s assistant, headed into the changing rooms ahead of Giggs, his former Manchester United teammate. But any harsh words in Ireland’s dressing room made little obvious difference as Wales continued to dominate.The hosts’ fluid attack line had Ireland on the back foot before Bale sent a square ball across the box to Roberts. The ball sat up for the 22-year-old right-back, who lashed a left-footed half-volley into the back of the net for his first goal in senior football.There was to be no clean sheet for the hosts, however, as Ramsey took his eye off the ball to gift Williams possession. The 31-year-old Millwall player went on to produce a cool finish, lifting the ball over Wayne Hennessey in the Wales goal.Tyler Roberts came off the bench and came close to a debut goal before Ireland’s torment was over. Afterwards O’Neill admitted his men had been well beaten, and by Bale in particular. “He is capable of unlocking defences, scoring the goal like he did tonight,” said the manager. “And they’ve got players who accompany him.“We were well beaten in the game. It was a long way back after going three goals down, but we’ll learn from that.”Republic of Ireland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8fa9dcee5b955b709f0c4074e86f6773e0a736/0_184_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2f5cf22804cb799b9474662f0daec0","title":"uk us border officials join forces in bid to tackle female genital mutilation","story":"Information from airport interviews to be shared as part of Anglo-US drive to protect potential victimsBritish police and border security will share intelligence on female genital mutilation with US counterparts as part of a drive to increase prosecutions and prevent abuse.Information on flight paths and investigations will be shared between the UK authorities and US agencies, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.There are elements of organised crime involved in FGM, Balhatchet said, but under-reporting and a lack of intelligence are major barriers for security services.In May, campaigners welcomed news of two forced marriage convictions in one week. But while FGM has been illegal in the UK for more than three decades, there has not yet been a successful prosecution.Between January and March this year, there were 1,030 newly recorded cases of FGM in England, according to NHS figures. Figures from the NPCC show that FGM protection orders, which safeguard actual or potential victims under civil law, were granted 220 timesbetween 2015, when they were introduced, to the end of March 2018.A pilot project investigating how to improve the effectiveness of these orders, which until recently were not collated centrally, has been launched by the Ministry of Justice and the NPCC.FGM is believed to be taking place both abroad and in the UK, with Border Force staff also tracking suspicious packages. “Sometimes you’ll see beads used for ceremonies, razor blades, or different liquids, sometimes you might see sanitary towels,” said Amanda Read, national operational lead for safeguarding at the Border Force, who said staff routinely look for indicators of FGM.To mark the agreement with US agencies, officers held intelligence-gathering operations at airports across the UK, as well as JFK Airport in New York.Teams from Operation Limelight, which aims to raise awareness at airports and is carried out by border officials, police and charities, targeted inbound flights from countries where FGM and forced marriage are prevalent.Staff look for anything unusual – a person’s demeanour, if they are uncomfortable walking, or if someone else is holding their passport.During an operation at Heathrow on Thursday, specialist teams identified three people who might be at risk. Their names, addresses and school details will be forwarded to local agencies such as social services. A six-year-old girl’s details were taken for referral after staff found that she couldn’t or wouldn’t speak to them.Polly Harrar, founder of the Sharan Project, which supports survivors of forced marriages and “honour crimes”, said that while teams will focus on particular flights, they approach all travellers so that no community feels they are being singled out.Speaking from Heathrow, where she was assisting Operation Limelight, she said there should be a far greater focus on prevention. “Part of that is education, part of it is sustainable working within community, so that it’s community-led, not dictated,” she added.One mother, Afuwa, who arrived in the UK with her family following a holiday in Uganda, said she welcomed efforts by agencies to raise awareness. She said she was aware of communities practising FGM in northern Uganda. “That’s their culture,” she said, although she added that it is not something her family believes in.Dr Leyla Hussein, a trained psychotherapist and founder of the Dahlia project, a counselling service for FGM survivors, said survivors needed existing support was sporadic and needed to be greatly improved.“We still don’t have safe houses that girls can go to. They usually end up in hospital by themselves, extremely isolated, and they end up going back to their families anyway,” said Hussein.“The moment you go against parents you have gone against all your wider family. The battle will just get bigger. We need to ensure they have care.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289c288ede69e2e8b85a37244a2db9406187502/0_545_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a884829a07c5ae29ce8dc7ddf9b4ae","title":"should i limit the amount of time my child spends with their mobile phone","story":"Children and parents may not agree on how much screen time is acceptable, but some ground rules about usage and online security will make for a more harmonious householdIt’s an argument virtually every modern parent has had with their child: the battle to prise them away from the mobile phone they’re glued to. For children, a smartphone is a window to games, videos and constant interaction with their friends. But for parents, it can feel like a minefield, raising questions about whether their access should be restricted and how to keep them safe as they learn to navigate the digital world. But who’s in the right?First, it’s worth bearing in mind that screen time can be beneficial. Peter Twining, professor of education (futures) at the Open University, conducted research between 2015 and 2017 into mobile phone use among five- to 11-year-olds, and his findings about what children use phones to access may surprise parents who assume they’re just playing games. “We tend not to recognise the value of what they do on their mobile devices, but they often use them to extend an interest – for instance, if they’re interested in gymnastics, they’ll watch videos of routines and try to learn from them,” he says.This difference in understanding of children’s mobile phone usage may help to explain the substantial disparity in opinion between children and parents about how much screen time is acceptable. According to a survey of 1,000 adults and 1,000 children aged nine to 15 conducted by Tesco Mobile, the mean amount of screen time that adults thought appropriate for children was 1.75 hours, with children believing it to be 3.34 hours.But at least both parties do recognise that there should be limits. However, recent research suggests that instead of setting specific time limits for usage, such as a maximum of two hours per day, it’s actually the nature of the screen time that matters. For instance, passively flicking through social media posts is less beneficial than actively playing games, which can improve problem-solving skills and persistence. A study conducted by the University of Michigan on four to 11-year-olds found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction.”Twining agrees, saying: “I’m less concerned about screen time than about the nature of the interactions around the screen. The screen should become a shared focal point for interaction within the family rather than an inidual activity. The screen shouldn’t be an alternative to socialising with your child, it should be an enhancement to it.”Some experts believe that rather than setting concrete limits to screen time, it may be more useful to establish general house rules about the context of phone use. “Many families find a unified screen time approach beneficial,” says chartered psychologist Dr Sarah Kuppen, author of Little Kids, Big Dilemmas: Your parenting problems solved by science.“A media plan sets limits on screen usage to ensure children access a wide range of daily activities. Restrictions sometimes include screen-free zones, screen-free times or device curfews. However, these should be adapted and updated over time.”According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – these family guidelines are crucial. “You need to set a good example with your own device and any rules you create, be careful not to break them yourself. For instance, we never have our phones at the dinner table so we can all interact together offline.”Other suggestions from Papadopoulos include only letting children have their phones after their homework, and never allowing them to sleep with the device. She advises explaining the reasons behind these rules. “We know it’s a bad idea to use the phone just before bed because it causes sleep disturbance, so they need to get off it at least a couple of hours before. Equally, we know if a child is studying and their phone is pinging next to them, they won’t consolidate memory, so the chapter they’re reading will take twice as long to absorb. The more kids understand why you’re making these rules, the more they’ll live by them.“And if you still feel they’re using their phones too much, technology can actually help – there are apps where children are rewarded for taking time away from their tech.”Twining believes that parents know what’s appropriate, so they should trust their instincts. “They’re sometimes nervous about exercising it, but parents usually have really good common sense,” he says. “If children are on their phone all the time, clearly that’s too much – you want them to do other activities, too. The key is finding a balance.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274848e4e0be4abbac76fb3a11e637550fbba17/0_22_6303_3783/master/6303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ba209473a0a9eb36611c48c4efc2b0e3 1240w","title":"experience i run a hospice for animals","story":"I provide care for however long they have left, so they do not have to take their final steps aloneThe last day we had with Osha the bullmastiff was hard, although perfect for her. We took her for her favourite walk, gave her a meal of her favourite food (pasta) and then lay in the garden in the sun with her, feeding her fruit chews, which she loved. Then the vet came and sedated her and put her to sleep. I was so sad , but I knew it was the right time to say goodbye.I had heard about Osha through the charity I run, Pounds For Poundies, which tries to stop abandoned dogs from being put down in pounds. When I learned Osha had been dumped in the pound with terminal cancer, I had to take her in. This was October 2015, the same time my dog Maggie died suddenly in a veterinary hospital, which left me devastated. Maggie and Osha inspired me to set up the Maggie Fleming animal hospice, offering end-of-life care for animals, in Dumfries in March 2016. At the hospice, I provide them with a home, friendship, love, comfort and tailored vet care for however long they have left, so they do not have to take their final steps alone. The hospice is funded by charitable donations and I run it with help from my partner Adam, friends, family and volunteers.Osha’s favourite things were food and sleep, so she spent her last nine months being spoiled with breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in bed. She loved to steal eggs from our rescued chickens I would leave one on the doorstep so that when she went out for her late-night wees she would think she had found treasure. The vet who put Osha to sleep helped me realise it was the right thing to do. She told me that she sees similar situations almost weekly, when owners are so desperate not to make that heartbreaking decision that they leave it too late and the animals die in pain. The point of the hospice is to avoid that scenario.I look after a maximum of three animals at one time, so that I can provide the best care possible. It is very time-intensive. Some of the animals I have helped have lived all their lives in kennels, never been hugged or kissed and don’t know what to do when I cuddle them, although they are clearly desperate for affection. My day is busy in some ways – looking after the animals’ practical needs, feeding them and giving them medication or other required care – but it is peaceful in others. Old and sick animals need love and attention, so I spend a lot of time sitting with them, reading to them and cuddling them.I also care for more than 80 animals at my sanctuary for farmed animals and rescue hens. Many have been worked to death, and they come here rather than the slaughterhouse.There is something so sad about animals that have never known life outside a pen or a cage.We take animals from all over, but I cannot provide end-of-life care for all that need it, so I offer support to their owners instead. They can phone me 247 for advice. Often just talking to someone who understands their sorrow can help people through what can be one of the hardest decisions they ever have to make. Most importantly, it helps families to stay together until the end, which is the best outcome for everyone, especially the animal, which wants to be with the people it knows and loves. Knowing you have done right by your pet, giving back that love and loyalty as you see it safely to the end, is a huge responsibility and privilege.I have just started an end-of-life care plan for Bran, another abandoned dog, as he is starting to slow down. He was abandoned on the street with a tumour on his spleen when he was about 17 years old. He was given six weeks to live when he came here that was almosttwo and a half years ago. But his latest blood results show he is starting to slip into liver and kidney dysfunction. I sit with him for a couple of hours each day, washing his face with a warm cloth, which he loves, and giving him a massage to ease his muscles. I have promised him that when he tells me it is time to go I will listen. I will be there on his last day with all his favourite things and hold him as he slips away peacefully, knowing someone loved him to the last. • As told to Joan McFaddenDo you have an experience to share?

Perhaps your parents played it during long car journeys as a child, or you listened to it furtively in your bedroom way past your bedtime. Well, it’s even better as an adult. Sit back, relax and let Fry do the hard work for you.War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, read by Frederick Davidson61 hrs 8 mins, equivalent to driving from Inverness to Tel AvivJames Norton caused a stir when he took over our screens in the BBC’s six-part adaptation of Tolstoy’s vast 19th-century novel about life among Russia’s aristocracy in the Napoleonic wars. Seeing as merely holding the book aloft is likely to do you an injury, it’s wise to find an audible alternative. Luckily, the late Frederick Davidson – the chain-smoking titan of the audiobook world, who narrated more than 700 titles – had a quick 61-hour flick-through to make your life easier.Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection by Arthur Conan Doyle, read by Stephen Fry72 hrs 3 mins, equivalent to cycling from Monaco to MadridElementary, my dear Watson. Though, of course, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock’s creator, never really wrote those words – it’s a misattribution. Or is it? Find out for yourself by listening to Stephen Fry reading the Victorian novels that birthed the most well-known detective in the English language (with apologies to Poirot and Marple).The Romanovs 1613-1918 by Simon Sebag Montefiore, read by Simon Russell Beale28 hrs 45 mins, equivalent to driving from London to TallinnRussia’s a big country, which means that any attempt to cover even a chunk of its history is going to take up a lot of book. Simon Sebag Montefiore’s look at the history of the Romanovs – the dynasty of tsars and tsarinas who ruled Russia and its empire from the 17th century up until the revolutions of 1917 and the death of Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 – was well reviewed, but is a heavy book to carry around and get through. Simon Russell Beale, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in films The Death of Stalin and Into the Woods, reads it all for you, which makes it much easier to sort your tsarinas from your Tatianas and your Alexanders from your, er, other Alexanders.Ulysses by James Joyce, read by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan27 hrs 16 mins, equivalent to flying from London to WellingtonThis is probably one of those books you always thought you ought to manage if only you could summon the wherewithal. James Joyce’s bizarre, epic, rambling novel is a literary landmark. Saying you’ve read it is a sure-fire way to earn appreciative nods from any real-life writers at your friend’s dinner party – and they need never know that it was read to you in Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan’s dulcet tones.Bleak House by Charles Dickens, read by Miriam Margolyes43 hrs 12 mins, equivalent to flying from London to Los Angeles and back, twiceUnless you’ve got Miriam Margolyes (think Professor Sprout in Harry Potter and Mrs Mingott in The Age of Innocence) guiding you through Charles Dickens’s least-enticing-sounding novel, with its vast list of characters and occasionally impenetrable satire, the truly bleak part about ticking Bleak House off your should-really-read-that list will be all the paper cuts you get from turning those oh-so-many pages.James Bond: The Collection by various authors, read by various narrators12 days 22 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to driving from Tunis to Cape Town and backAlmost no other literary character has had such traction, such deep cultural penetration and such extensive remodelling as James Bond. Originally created by Ian Fleming and named after the author of a book on birds in the Caribbean, Bond has captured the imagination of writers, from Anthony Horowitz and John Gardner, to Kingsley Amis and Sebastian Faulks. This extraordinary, leviathan series – with readers including Bill Nighy, David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Bonneville – encompasses almost all of them.Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, read by Scott Brick35 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to cycling from Madrid to BarcelonaIt’s the musical that’s become a phenomenon: it’s been used to subtweet President Trump by the American Civil Liberties Union been poignantly performed in parts in front of Barack Obama in his last days of office and had its every line obsessed over by legions of fans across the world. But the book Hamilton was largely based on, Ron Chernow’s hefty, comprehensive biography of the US’s first treasury secretary, hasn’t had quite so much attention. It should – it’s a great listen, contains some insightful stuff and will help you get your head around the show that bit better.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The government has welcomed the idea, having committed last year to start measuring job quality.The measures could be launched as soon as next year and are likely to fuel the row between Labour and the Conservatives over the health of the economy. Labour has responded to record employment figures by claiming they have been achieved by growth in poor-quality jobs with limited prospects and few protections.Questions in the survey will include how well employees feel supported by their immediate boss and how well they get on with colleagues, and whether they have experienced anxiety or depression caused by work in the past year. It is likely to become part of the quarterly labour force survey, which asks 88,000 people about their working lives, and comes amid broader attempts to measure the population’s wellbeing alongside other more conventional economic measures such as GDP.“A focus on record employment levels and the quantity of work only tells us so much,” said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce and the co-chair of the working group, which devised the new measures. “We do not know whether workers feel happy, well-treated, have opportunities for progression, work the number of hours they want to, or feel they have control over their working lives. To manage this problem, we must measure this problem.”The living wage is independently calculated, voluntary and based on the cost of living. There are two rates, to recognise the higher cost of living in London. These are:The national living wage is a statutory minimum all employers must pay staff aged over 25.National living wage (formerly the minimum wage): £7.83Other minimum rates of pay apply to workers under the age of 25.The UK ranks in the middle of the OECD’s assessment of job quality, which concluded in 2015 that the best jobs among its 36 member countries were in Australia, Austria and Denmark. The secretary-general of the organisation, Angel Gurría, has said job quality has a direct influence on the overall productivity of a firm, and the leaders of the G20 nations agreed in 2015 to start focusing on improving the quality of jobs and not just the quantity. Changes in technology, enabling gig-economy work and the increased role of computer systems in warehouse work, are widely regarded as posing a threat to the quality of jobs.Research funded by the UK government has shown that stock-market-listed companies, which recorded the highest levels of employee wellbeing, outperformed the market and that they enjoyed lower absence through sickness and presenteeism.The business minister, Kelly Tolhurst, said: “We are giving millions of workers new rights and workplace protections and this report will be very helpful as we bring forward further workplace reforms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f84c8a2a0e1e53c01a4bbf46ab9511e9997addeb/0_106_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ad59cd4d3554ee203d68c9851b1455d","title":"homes for sale in national parks in pictures","story":"Enjoy panoramic views from these properties, from Scotland to West Sussex"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34bd2b7c7bbeef9cfe48a2ba194aba66d4f9b11b/0_170_5225_3135/master/5225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a1c6449835045909a54d37220fe9f0","title":"razorlight tracks of week special","story":"Did Johnny Borrell just compare his lover to a sandwich? The indie box-ticking return of the house of J-BoHey Dylan, fire up the deep fat fryer, because Razorlight are back baby. It’s worth stating that, although they get a lot of stick for Johnny Borrell’s inflated sense of self-importance, their debut album is genuinely one of the greatest, made better for Borrell’s sneering pretentiousness on lyrics such as “She’s been reading Bukowski for days And she leans over, spits her name in my face.” This gets fairly close to those dizzy heights, suggesting the gods of Mount Olympus might jitter and caress in response to the singer’s current sexual predicaments. It’s got a good middle eight, with Borrell begging a lover not to leave by comparing her, angrily, to a sandwich.It’s a cavalcade of Razorlight singles! Back in 2014, Borrell told  that he didn’t engage with any media, as he learned more about the world from walking down the street with a guitar. Shortly after he blamed all the bad Razorlight songs on the band’s old drummer. So what can we say now he’s got a new line-up and full creative control? This sounds like something a new band from Stevenage would send into their local BBC Introducing show. Glad we waited.Blimey, you wait ages for a new Razorlight single and then three come along at once. Perhaps Sorry? is apologising for the songs I just listened to? No, I don’t think so instead it dips its toes into different pools of indie past, sounding a bit like secondary-school art rockers Cajun Dance Party with hints of that second Mystery Jets album where they tried to go 80s. Why is this happening? What’s next?!FFS! There are four new Razorlight singles! So why have they done this? Four singles that all seem like exercises in making different flavours of 2004 indie rock? This does at least nod to the band’s early days, ie it sounds as if it were written by horny students. There’s a lot of shout-singing reminiscent of fellow indie graduates Good Shoes, who were sort of like Razorlight but with self-deprecation. The problem with this genre is you can’t really return to it in your mid-30s, because it’s inherently about passion and youth and not thinking things through. That’s why bands tend to mature and make weird shed music, whereas Razorlight seem as if they want one last trip to an indie disco that has long since been turned into a Giraffe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d893c793f8e699e8a2f0f6c600f98460ff8943a/0_17_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b2e8799dd57032a4b74f095a6ae217","title":"human impulses run riot chinas shocking pace of change","story":"Thirty years ago, politics was paramount. Now, only money counts. China’s leading novelist examines a nation that has transformed in a single lifetime. By  Yu HuaWhen I try to describe how China has changed over the past 50 years, countless roads appear in front of me. Given the sheer immensity of these changes, all I can do is try first to follow a couple of main roads, and then a few smaller ones, to see where they take us.My first main road begins in the past. In my 58 years, I have experienced three dramatic changes, and each one has been accompanied by a surge in suicides among officials. The first time was during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. At the start of that period, many members of the Chinese Communist party woke up one day to find they had been purged: overnight they had become “power-holders taking the capitalist road”. After suffering every kind of psychological and physical abuse, some chose to take their own lives. In the small town in south China where I grew up, some hanged themselves or swallowed insecticide, while others threw themselves down wells: wells in south China have narrow mouths, and if you e into one headfirst, there is no way you will come out alive.In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, many people from the lowest tiers of society formed their own mass organisations, proclaiming themselves commanders of a “Cultural Revolution headquarters”. These iniduals – rebels, they were called – often went on to secure official positions of one kind or another. They enjoyed only a brief career, however. Following Mao’s death in 1976, the subsequent end of the Cultural Revolution and the emergence of the reform-minded Deng Xiaoping as China’s new leader, some rebels believed they would suffer just as much as the officials they had tormented a few years before.Thus came the second surge in suicides – this time of officials who had clawed their way to power as revolutionary radicals. One official in my little town drowned himself in the sea: he smoked a lot of cigarettes first, and the stubs littering the shore marked the agony of indecision that preceded his death. This was a much smaller surge in suicides than the first one, because Deng was not out for political revenge, focusing instead on kickstarting economic reforms and opening up to the west. This policy led in turn to China’s economic miracle, the downside of which has been environmental pollution, growing inequality and pervasive corruption.In late 2012 came the third dramatic change in my lifetime, when China entered the era of Xi Jinping. No sooner did Xi become general secretary of the Communist party than our new leader launched an anti-corruption drive, the scale and force of which took almost everyone by surprise. The third surge in suicides followed. When officials who had stuffed their pockets during China’s breakneck economic rise discovered they were being investigated and realised they could not wriggle free, some put an end to things by suicide. In cases involving lower-ranking officials who were under investigation but had not yet been taken into custody, the government explanation was that their suicides were triggered by depression. But, if a high-ranking official took his own life, a harsher judgment was passed. On 23 November 2017, after Zhang Yang, a general, hanged himself in his own home, the People’s Liberation Army Daily reported that he “had evaded party discipline and the laws of the nation” and described his suicide as “a disgraceful action”.These three surges in suicide demonstrate the failure and impotence of legal institutions in China. The public security organs, prosecutorial agencies and courts all stopped functioning at the start of the Cultural Revolution thereafter, laws existed only in name. Since Mao’s death, a robust legal system has never truly been established and, today, law’s failure manifests itself in two ways. First, the law is strong only on paper: in practice, law tends to be subservient to the power that officials wield. Second, when officials realise they are being investigated and know their position won’t save them, some will choose to die rather than submit to legal sanctions, for officials who believe in power don’t believe in law.These two points, seemingly at odds, are actually two sides of the same coin. The difference between the three surges in suicide is this: the first two were outcomes of a political struggle framed by the start and the end of the Cultural Revolution. The third, by contrast, stems from the blight of corruption that has accompanied 30 years of rapid economic development. Some argue, of course, that the anti-corruption campaign is conducted selectively, with the goal of purging Xi Jinping’s political opponents. But the underlying problem is: how many officials are there today who are truly clean? A few years ago, an official from China’s prosecutorial agencies put it to me this way: “If you were to stick all of today’s officials in a line and shoot every one of them, that would be unfair to some. But a lot would slip through the net if you only shot every other one.”When I turn onto the second main road that stretches from the China of my childhood to the present day, what I see before me is the declining importance of the family and the growing importance of inidualism. In Mao’s China, the inidual could find no fulfilment in ordinary social life. If one wanted to express a personal aspiration, the only way to do so was to throw oneself into a collective movement such as the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution. Mind you, in those grand campaigns, the inidual’s aspirations had to conform entirely to whatever the “correct” political line happened to be at that moment – the slightest deviation would cause disaster.To use an analogy current at the time, each of us was a little drop of water, gathered into the great flood of socialism. But it wasn’t so easy to be that drop of water. In my town, there was a Cultural Revolution activist who would almost every day be at the forefront of some demonstration or other, often being first to raise his fist and shout “Down with Liu Shaoqi!” (Liu, nominally the head of state, had just been purged.) One day, however, he inadvertently misspoke, shouting “Down with Mao Zedong!” instead. Within seconds he had been thrown to the ground by the “revolutionary masses”, and thus he began a wretched phase in life, denounced and beaten at every turn.In that era, the inidual could find space only in the context of family life – any independent leanings could only be expressed at home. That is why family values were so important to Chinese people then, and why marital infidelity was seen as so intolerable. If you were caught having an extramarital affair, the social morality of the day meant that you would be subjected to all kinds of humiliation: you might be paraded through the streets with half your hair shaved off or packed off to prison.During the Cultural Revolution, there were certainly cases of husbands and wives denouncing each other and fathers and sons falling out, but these were not typical – the vast majority of families enjoyed unprecedented solidarity. A friend of mine told me her father had been a professor at the start of the Cultural Revolution, while her mother was a housewife. Her father, born to a landlord’s family, became the target of attacks, but her mother, from a humbler background, was placed among the revolutionary ranks. Pressed by the radicals to orce her father, her mother outright refused – and not only that: every time her father was hauled off to a denunciation session, she would make a point of sitting in the front row and, if she saw someone beating her husband, she would rush over and start hitting back. Such brawls might leave her bruised and bleeding, but she would sit back down proudly in the front row, and the radicals lost their nerve and gave up beating her husband. After the Cultural Revolution ended, my friend’s father told her, with tears in his eyes, that had it not been for her mother he might well have taken his own life. There are many such stories.After Mao’s death, the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping brought dramatic changes to China, changes that permeated all levels of Chinese society. In a matter of 30 years, we went from one extreme to another, from an era where human nature was suppressed to an era where human impulses could run riot, from an era when politics was paramount to an era when only money counts.Before, limited by social constraints, people could feel a modicum of freedom only within the family with the loss of those constraints, that modest freedom which was once so prized now counts for little. Extramarital affairs have become more and more widespread and are no longer a cause for shame. It is commonplace for successful men to keep a mistress, or sometimes multiple mistresses – which people often jokingly compare to a teapot needing at least four or five cups to make a full tea set. In one case I know of, a wealthy businessman bought all 10 flats in the wing of an apartment complex. He installed his legally recognised wife in one flat, and his nine legally unrecognised mistresses in the other flats, one above the other, so that he could select at his pleasure and convenience on which floor of the building he would spend the night.Having taken a couple of main roads that trace China’s journey over the past half-century, it is time to travel down some smaller ones. The first begins with Buddhist temples. During the Cultural Revolution, temples were closed down and some suffered serious damage. In my little town, Red Guards knocked off the heads and arms of every Buddhist sculpture in the local temples, which were then converted into storehouses. Afterwards, the damaged temples were restored and they all reopened, typically with two round bronze incense burners in front of the main hall: the first to invoke blessings for wealth, the second to invoke blessings for security.When I visited temples in the 1980s, in the first censer I would often see a huge assembly of joss sticks, blazing away furiously, while in the second, a paltry handful would be smoking feebly. In those days China was still very poor, and, as most people saw it, when you didn’t have money, being safe didn’t amount to much. Now China is rich, and when you go into a temple you see joss sticks burning just as brightly in the security censer as in the wealth one – it is when you are rich that security acquires particular importance.In China today, Buddhist temples are crowded with worshippers, while Taoist temples are largely deserted. A few years ago, I asked a Taoist abbot: “Taoism is native to China, so why is it not as popular as Buddhism, which came here from abroad?” His answer was short: “Buddhism has money and Taoism doesn’t.”His explanation, although it rather took me aback, expresses a truth about Chinese society: money, or material interest, has become the main motivating force. In the 1980s, there was a series of student protests in China, culminating in the Tiananmen demonstrations of 1989, when not just students but city dwellers all across the country joined the rallies. Back then, the demonstrations were largely motivated by concern for the fate of the nation and a desire to see democratic freedoms put in place. Today, people still demonstrate, but on a very small scale, and these demonstrations – “mass incidents” in official parlance – are completely different from the protests in the 1980s. Protests today are not geared towards transforming society – they are simply designed to protect the material interests of the group involved.A few years ago, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, the education authorities announced that universities would be reserving more places for students from poor areas in west China. This triggered an uproar among the parents of Jiangsu high-school students preparing for the university entrance examination. Concerned that this new policy would reduce their children’s chances of getting into university, they marched in the streets to protest. Something similar happened a few years ago in Shanghai, when retirees took to the streets, worried that if welfare funds were allocated to poor areas, their own retirement benefits would be slashed.These constant “mass incidents”, I should point out, reflect real issues. In recent years, for instance, many retired military veterans have gathered together across the country in protests against the stingy benefits and pensions they receive from the state. Back in the 1980s, they argue, veterans used to be more generously rewarded, relative to the cost of living. Today, even though China is richer, they receive little. Unsurprisingly, veterans feel shortchanged and disrespected.Other mass incidents, such as the widespread demonstrations by truck drivers in June, have been sparked by the fierce economic competition that now characterises life in China. In numerous industries, it has become common practice to try to secure more business by pushing down prices as low as they can possibly go. I was struck by this new reality a few years ago, at the end of a trip I had taken to South Africa for the World Cup. At the airport, I bought a vuvuzela in the airport as a souvenir, paying more than 100 yuan (£11). It was only when I got back to Beijing that I realised it was made in China. At the start, Chinese manufacturers had set their factory price at over five yuan a piece, but they soon found themselves being underbid. Some factories ultimately set their price as low as 2.2 yuan, when the production cost was 2 yuan per unit. The result of all this ferocious competition is that the profit margin keeps getting slimmer and slimmer, and those who suffer most are ordinary workers, who often see no increase in their salary even as their work hours are extended.Now I need to take two other roads – the road of innovation and the road of nostalgia. Innovation first. Given the speed at which new technologies become dominant, you sometimes feel that there is no gap at all between new and old. Take mobile payments: in the space of just a few years, Alibaba’s Alipay mobile app and Tencent’s WeChat Pay app have been loaded on to practically every smartphone in the country. From big shopping malls to little corner shops – any place where a transaction can be made will have the scannable QR codes for these two payment platforms displayed in a prominent location. People just need to take their phone out of their pocket, do a quick scan and the payment is made. Even Chinese beggars have to keep up with the times: sometimes they too have a QR code handy, and they will ask passersby to scan it and use the mobile payment platform to dispense some spare change.I recently went for more than a year without using cash or a credit card, because it is just so convenient to pay by phone instead. This July, though, when my English translator came to Beijing and my wife and I took him out for dinner, I went to scan the restaurant’s QR code but the transaction failed to go through. Instead of trying a second time, I suddenly felt an urge to pay in cash. When I pulled some banknotes out of my pocket, handed them to the cashier and received change in return, I felt a pleasant tingle of novelty.This novelty is all the more remarkable given that just 30 years ago, when Chinese people went on business trips, they would worry so much about their money being stolen that they would hide cash in their underpants, the safest place for it. They would have a little pocket sewn on the inside, with a button for extra security. When a bill needed to be paid they would reach a hand into their underwear, grope around a bit, and pull out the requisite five-mao or one-yuan note, distinguishable by feel because one was smaller than the other. Women would withdraw to a secluded spot to retrieve their cash, but some men would have no such inhibitions and would rummage about in their underpants quite unabashedly.When I turn to the road of nostalgia, I think of how my home county of Haiyan has transformed. When I was a boy, Haiyan had a total population of 300,000, with only 8,000 living in the county town itself. Now, the county has a population of 380,000, of whom 100,000 live in the county seat. Urbanisation has created a lot of problems, one of them being what happens after farmers move to cities. Local governments have expropriated large swathes of agricultural land to enable an enormous urban expansion program: some of the land is allocated to industry in order to attract investment, build factories and boost government revenues, but most of it is sold off at a high price to real-estate developers. The result is that high-rise apartment buildings now sprout in profusion where once only crops grew. After their land and houses in the countryside are expropriated, farmers “move upstairs” into housing blocks that the local government has provided in compensation. In wealthy counties, some farmers may be awarded up to three or four apartments, in which case they will live in one and rent out the other two or three others may receive a large cash settlement.But the questions then become: how do they adjust to city life? Now disconnected from the form of labour to which they were accustomed, what new jobs are there for them to do? Some drive taxis and some open little shops, but others just loaf around, playing mahjong all day, and others take to gambling and lose everything they have. Every time a community of dispossessed farmers settles into a new housing project, gambling operations will follow them there, because some of the residents will be flush with cash after the government payouts. In China, it is forbidden to open gambling establishments, but this doesn’t stop unlicensed operators from cramming their gambling accessories into a few large suitcases and lugging them around these new neighbourhoods, where they will talk their way into the homes of resettled farmers. The gambling outfits play hide-and-seek with the police, setting up shop here today, shifting to a new spot tomorrow.What is the situation back where the farmers came from – the houses in the countryside now expropriated but yet to be demolished? Peasants often have dogs to protect the home and guard the property. When peasants move to the cities, they no longer need guard dogs, so they leave them behind. And so you see poignant scenes in those empty, weed-infested farm compounds, as those abandoned dogs, all skin and bones, faithfully continue to perform sentry duty, now rushing from one end of the property to the other, standing on a high point and gazing off into the distance, their eyes burning with hope, longing for the past to return.Wishing the past could return is a mood that is spreading through today’s society. Two patterns are typical. The more widespread of the two reflects the yearnings of the poor. China’s enhanced status as the world’s second largest economy has brought them few benefits they continue to lead a life of grinding hardship. They cherish their memories of the past, for although they were poor then, the word “unemployed” was yet to exist. What’s more, in those days there was no moneyed class in a real sense: Mao’s monthly salary, for example, was just 404.8 yuan, compared to my parents’ joint income of 120 yuan. There was only a small gap between rich and poor, and social inequalities were limited.A different form of nostalgia is prevalent among successful people who, having risen as high as they can possibly go, now find themselves in danger of tumbling off the cliff. Someone reported to me an exchange he had had with one of Shanghai’s ultra-rich, a man who had relied on bribery and other underhand methods to transform himself from a pauper into a millionaire. Realising he would soon be arrested and anticipating a long prison term, he stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows of his huge, lofty, luxurious office and looked down at the construction workers far below, busy building the foundation of another skyscraper. How he wished he could be one of those workers, he said, for though their work was hard and their pay was low, they didn’t have to live in a state of such high anxiety. Faced with the prospect of losing everything they have gained, such people find themselves wishing their spectacular career hadn’t happened at all, wishing they could reclaim the past.If the past were really to return – that past where you needed grain coupons to buy rice, oil coupons to buy cooking oil, cotton coupons to buy cloth, that past of dire material shortages, where the supply of goods was dictated by quotas – would those people who hanker for the past be happy? I doubt it.As I see it, when the poor pine for the past, this is not a rational desire – it is simply a way of venting their feelings, the voicing of a frustration that is rooted in their discontent with current Chinese realities. And when that other, smaller group of people who have been successful in government or business realise they are going to spend the rest of their life behind bars and wish they could reclaim the past, this sentiment springs only from a wistful regret: “If I had known this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have got myself into this mess.”I’m reminded of a joke that’s been doing the rounds. Here is what’s unfair about this society:The pretty girl says: “I want a diamond ring!” She gets it.The rich guy says: “I want a pretty girl!” He gets her.I say: “I want a shower!” But there’s no water.That last situation, I myself have experienced. In my early years, more often than not, water would cut off just as I was having a shower – sometimes at the precise moment when I had lathered myself in soap from head to toe. All I could do then was hammer on the pipe with my fists, at the same time raising my head so that the final few drops of water would rinse my eyes and save them from smarting as for when the water would come on again, I could only wait patiently and hope heaven was on my side. Back then, nobody would have seen water stoppages at shower-time as a social injustice, because in those bygone days, there were no rich guys, and so pretty girls didn’t get diamond rings and rich guys didn’t get pretty girls.It is often said that children represent the future. In closing, let me try to capture the changing outlook of three generations of Chinese boys as a way of mapping in simple terms China’s trajectory over the years. If you asked these boys what to look for in life, I think you would hear very different answers.A boy growing up in the Cultural Revolution might well have said: “Revolution and struggle.”A boy growing up in the early 1990s, as economic reforms entered their second decade, might well have said: “Career and love.”Today’s boy might well say: “Money and girls.”Translated by Allan H Barr• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6926b28f6c12a5e74cee61541e1c0e9c93bc1697/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dfa0514982567e34887baaa506e02ac","title":"the real goldfinger the london banker who broke the world","story":"Every January, to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, Oxfam tells us how much richer the world’s richest people have got. In 2016, their report showed that the wealthiest 62 iniduals owned the same amount as the bottom half of the world’s population. This year, that number had dropped to 42: three-and-half-dozen people with as much stuff as three-and-a-half billion.This yearly ritual has become part of the news cycle, and the inequality it exposes has ceased to shock us. The very rich getting very much richer is now part of life, like the procession of the seasons. But we should be extremely concerned: their increased wealth gives them ever-greater control of our politics and of our media. Countries that were once democracies are becoming plutocracies plutocracies are becoming oligarchies oligarchies are becoming kleptocracies.Things were not always this way. In the years after the second world war, the trend was in the opposite direction: the poor were getting richer we were all getting more equal. To understand how and why that changed, we need to go back to the dying days of the conflict, to a resort in New Hampshire, where a group of economists set out to secure humanity’s future.This is the story of how their dream failed and how a London banker’s bright idea broke the world.In the years after the first world war, money flowed between countries pretty much however its owners wished, destabilising currencies and economies in pursuit of profit. Many of the wealthy grew wealthier even while economies fell apart. The chaos led to the election of extremist governments in Germany and elsewhere, to competitive devaluations and beggar-my-neighbour tariffs, to trade wars and, ultimately, to the horrors of the second world war.The allies wanted to prevent this ever happening again. So, at a meeting at the Bretton Woods resort in New Hampshire in 1944, they negotiated the details of an economic architecture that would – in perpetuity – stop uncontrolled money flows. This, they hoped, would keep governments from using trade as a weapon with which to bully neighbours, and create a stable system that would help secure peace and prosperity.Under the new system, all currencies would be pegged to the dollar, which would in turn be pegged to gold. An ounce of gold cost $35 (that’s about $500£394 today). In other words, the US Treasury pledged that, if a foreign government turned up with $35, it could always buy an ounce of gold. The United States was promising to keep everyone supplied with enough dollars to fund international trade, as well as to maintain sufficient gold reserves for those dollars to be inherently valuable.To prevent speculators trying to attack these fixed currencies, cross-border money flows were severely constrained. Money could move overseas, but only in the form of long-term investments, not to speculate short term against currencies or bonds.To understand how this system worked, imagine an oil tanker. If it has just one huge tank, then the oil can slosh backwards and forwards in ever greater waves, until it destabilises the vessel, which overturns and sinks. At the Bretton Woods conference, the oil was ided between smaller tanks, one for each country. The liquid could slosh back and forth within its little compartments, but would be unable to achieve enough momentum to damage the integrity of the vessel.Strangely, one of the best evocations of this long-gone system is Goldfinger, the James Bond book. The film of the same name has a slightly different plot, but they both feature a Soviet agent trying to undermine the west’s financial system by interfering with its gold reserves. “Gold and currencies backed by gold are the foundations of our international credit,” a Bank of England official named Colonel Smithers explains to 007.The villain Auric Goldfinger’s cunning scheme is to own pawnbrokers all over Britain, buy up gold jewellery and trinkets from ordinary Brits in need of a bit of cash, then melt them down into plates, attach the plates to his Rolls-Royce, drive them to Switzerland, reprocess them and fly them to India. By doing so, Goldfinger will not only undermine the British currency and economy, but also earn profits he could use to fund communists and other miscreants. Hundreds of Bank of England employees are engaged in trying to stop this kind of scam from happening, Smithers tells 007, but Goldfinger is too clever for them. He has secretly become Britain’s richest man, and has £5m-worth of gold bars sitting in the vaults of a bank in the Bahamas.“We are asking you to bring Mr Goldfinger to book, Mr Bond, and get that gold back,” says Smithers. “You know about the currency crisis and the high Bank rate? Of course. Well, England needs that gold, badly – and the quicker the better.”By modern standards, Goldfinger wasn’t doing anything wrong, apart perhaps from dodging some taxes. He was buying up gold at a price people were prepared to pay for it, then selling it in another market, where people were prepared to pay more. It was his money. It was his gold. So what was the problem? He was oiling the wheels of commerce, efficiently allocating capital where it could best be used, no?No, because that wasn’t how Bretton Woods worked. Colonel Smithers considered the gold to belong not only to Goldfinger, but also to Great Britain. The system didn’t consider the owner of money to be the only person with a say in what happened to it. According to the carefully crafted rules, the nations that created and guaranteed the value of money had rights to that money, too. They restricted the rights of money-owners in the interests of everybody else. At Bretton Woods, the allies – desperate to avoid a repeat of the horrors of the inter-war depression and the second world war – decided that, when it came to international trade, society’s rights trumped those of money-owners.All this is hard to imagine for anyone who has only experienced the world since the 1980s, because the system now is so different. Money flows ceaselessly between countries, nosing out investment opportunities in China, Brazil, Russia or wherever. If a currency is overvalued, investors sense the weakness and gang up on it like sharks around a sickly whale. In times of global crisis, the money retreats into the safety of gold or US government bonds. In boom times, it pumps up share prices elsewhere in its restless quest for a good return. These waves of liquid capital have such power that they can wash away all but the strongest governments. The prolonged speculative attacks on the euro, the rouble or the pound, which have been such a feature of the past few decades, would have been impossible under the Bretton Woods system, which was specifically designed to stop them happening.One reason Baring hated the restrictions was that they were killing the City of London. “It was like driving a powerful car at 20 miles an hour,” lamented one banker, of his spell in charge of a major British bank. “The banks were anaesthetised. It was a kind of dream life.” In those days, bankers arrived at work late, left early and frittered away much of the time in between having boozy lunches. No one particularly cared, because there wasn’t much to do anyway.Today, looking over its glass-and-steel skyline, it is hard to imagine that the City of London once almost died as a financial centre. In the 1950s and 1960s, the City played little part in the national conversation. Yet, although few books about the swinging 60s even mention the City, something very significant was brewing there – something that would change the world far more than the Beatles or Mary Quant or David Hockney ever did, something that would shatter the high-minded strictures of the Bretton Woods system.By the time Ian Fleming published Goldfinger in 1959, there were already some leaks in the compartments of the oil tanker. The problem was that not all foreign governments trusted the US to honour its commitment to use the dollar as an impartial international currency and they were not unreasonable in doing so, since Washington did not always act as a fair umpire. In the immediate post-second-world-war years, the US government had sequestered communist Yugoslavia’s gold reserves. The rattled eastern bloc countries then made a habit of keeping their dollars in European banks rather than in New York.Similarly, when Britain and France attempted to regain control of the Suez canal in 1956, a disapproving Washington froze their access to dollars and doomed the venture. These were not the actions of a neutral arbiter. Britain at the time was staggering from one crisis to another. In 1957, it raised interest rates and stopped banks using sterling to finance trade in an attempt to keep the pound strong (this was the “currency crisis and the high bank rate” that Smithers told Bond about).City banks, which could no longer use sterling in the way they were accustomed, began to use dollars instead, and they obtained those dollars from the Soviet Union, which was keeping them in London and Paris so as to avoid becoming vulnerable to American pressure. This turned out to be a profitable thing to do. In the US, there were limits on how much interest banks could charge on dollar loans – but not so in London.This market – the bankers called the dollars “eurodollars” – gave a bit of life to the City of London in the late 1950s, but not much. The big bond issues were still taking place in New York, a fact which annoyed many bankers in London. After all, many of the companies borrowing the money were European, yet it was American banks that were earning the fat commissions.One banker in particular was not prepared to tolerate this: Siegmund Warburg. Warburg was an outsider in the cosy world of the City. For one thing, he was German. For another, he hadn’t given up on the idea that a City banker’s job was to hustle for business. In 1962, Warburg learned from a friend at the World Bank that some $3bn was circulating outside the US – sloshing around and ready to be put to use. Warburg had been a banker in Germany in the 1920s and remembered arranging bond deals in foreign currencies. Why couldn’t his bankers do something similar again?For the City’s most ambitious financiers, this was tantalising: there was all this money squirrelled away, doing nothing much, and it was exactly what they needed in their quest to start selling bonds again. As Warburg saw it, if he could somehow access the money, package it up and lend it, he would be in business. Surely, Warburg thought, he could persuade the people who were paying Swiss bankers to look after their money that they would rather earn an income from it by buying his bonds? And surely he could persuade European companies that they would rather borrow this money from him and avoid paying the steep fees demanded in New York?It was a great idea, but there was a problem: the compartments of the oil tanker were in the way. It was impossible for Warburg to move that money from Switzerland via London to clients who wanted to borrow it. But he took two of his best men and told them to get it done anyway.They began their efforts in October 1962, the same month that the Beatles released Love Me Do. The bankers finalised their deal on 1 July the following year, the same day that the Fab Four recorded She Loves You, the song that sparked global Beatlemania. That extraordinary nine months not only revolutionised pop music, but also geopolitics, since they included the Cuban missile crisis and John F Kennedy’s Ich bin ein Berliner speech. Under the circumstances, it is understandable that a simultaneous revolution in global finance passed little remarked.Warburg’s new bond issue – these bonds became known as “eurobonds”, after the example set by eurodollars – was led by Ian Fraser, a Scottish war hero turned journalist turned banker. He and his colleague Peter Spira had to find ways to defang the taxes and controls designed to prevent hot money flowing across borders, and to find ways to pick and choose different aspects of different countries’ regulations for the various elements of their creation.The cumulative effect of this game of jurisdictional Twister was that Fraser created a bond paying a good rate of interest, on which no one had to pay tax of any kind, and which could be turned back into cash anywhere. These were what are known as bearer bonds. Whoever possessed the bond owned them there was no register of ownership or any obligation to record your holding, which was not written down anywhere.Fraser’s eurobonds were like magic. Before eurobonds, hidden wealth in Switzerland couldn’t really do much but now it could buy these fantastic pieces of paper, which could be carried anywhere, redeemed anywhere and all the while paid interest to their owners, tax free. Dodge taxes and make a profit, worldwide.So, who was buying Fraser’s magical invention? Who was providing the money he was lending to IRI, via Autostrade? “The main buyers of these bonds were iniduals, usually from eastern Europe but often also from Latin America, who wanted to have part of their fortune in mobile form so that if they had to leave they could leave quickly with their bonds in a small suitcase,” Fraser wrote in his autobiography. “There was still a mass migration of the surviving Jewish populations of central Europe heading for Israel and the west. To this was added the normal migration of fallen South American dictators heading east. Switzerland was where all this money was stashed away.”Later, historians tried to downplay Fraser’s account a little, and to claim that corrupt politicians – those fallen South American dictators – made up just a fifth or so of the demand for these early bond issues. As for the remaining four-fifths of the money that bought up the bonds, this came from standard tax dodgers – “Belgian dentists”, the bankers called them – high-earning professionals who steered a chunk of their earnings to Luxembourg or Geneva, and who welcomed this lovely new investment.The eurobonds set wealth free and were the first step towards creating the virtual country of the rich that I call Moneyland. Moneyland includes offshore finance, but is much broader than that, since it protects every aspect of a rich person’s life from scrutiny, not just their money. The same money-making dynamic that enticed Fraser to defang capital controls on behalf of his clients, entices his modern-day counterparts to find ways for the world’s richest people to avoid visa controls, journalistic scrutiny, legal liability and much more. Moneyland is a place where, if you are rich enough, whoever you are, wherever your money comes from, the laws do not apply to you.This is the dirty secret at the heart of the City’s rebirth, the beginning of the process that eventually led to today’s stratospheric inequality. It was all made possible by modern communications – the telegram, the phone, the telex, the fax, the email – and it allowed the world’s richest people to avoid the responsibilities of citizenshipThat first deal was for $15m. But once the way to sidestep the obstacles that stopped cash flowing offshore had been identified, there was nothing to stop more money following behind. In the second half of 1963, $35m of eurobonds were sold. In 1964, the market was $510m. In 1967, the total passed $1bn for the first time, and it is now one of the biggest markets in the world.The result was that, over time, the system created at Bretton Woods fell apart. More and more dollars were escaping offshore, where they avoided the regulations and taxes imposed upon them by the US government. But they were still dollars, and thus 35 of them were still worth an ounce of gold.The trouble that followed stemmed from the fact that dollars don’t just sit around doing nothing. They multiply. If you put a dollar in a bank, the bank uses it as security for the money it lends to someone else, meaning there are more dollars – your dollar, and the dollars someone else has borrowed. And if that person puts the money in another bank, and that bank lends it, there are now even more dollars, and so on.And since every one of those dollars was nominally worth a fixed amount of gold, the US would have needed to keep buying ever more gold to satisfy the potential demand. If the US did that, however, it would have to have bought that gold with dollars, meaning yet more dollars would exist, which would multiply in turn, meaning more gold purchases, and more dollars, until the system would eventually collapse under the weight of the fact that it didn’t make sense it couldn’t cope with offshore.The US government tried to defend the dollargold price, but every restriction it put on dollar movements just made it more profitable to keep your dollars in London, leading more money to leak offshore, and thus more pressure to build on the dollargold price. And where the dollars went, the bankers followed. The City had looser regulations and more accommodating politicians than Wall Street, and the banks loved it. In 1964, 11 US banks had branches in the City of London. In 1975, 58 did.The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who administered the federal banking system, opened a permanent office in London to inspect what the British branches of American banks were up to. But the Americans had no power in the UK and got no help from the locals. “It doesn’t matter to me,” said Jim Keogh, the Bank of England official responsible for monitoring these banks, “whether Citibank is evading American regulations in London”.By that time, however, Washington had bowed to the inevitable and stopped promising to redeem dollars for gold at $35 an ounce. It was the first step in a steady dismantling of all the safeguards created at Bretton Woods. The philosophical question over who really owned money – the person who earned it, or the country that created it – had been answered.If you had money, thanks to the accommodating bankers of London and Switzerland, you could now do what you wanted with it and governments could not stop you. As long as one country tolerated offshore, as Britain did, then the efforts of all the others came to nothing. If regulations stop at a country’s borders, but the money can flow wherever it wishes, its owners can outwit any regulators they choose.The developments that began with Warburg did not stop with simple eurobonds. The basic pattern was endlessly replicable. Identify a line of business that might make you and your clients money. Look around the world for a jurisdiction with the right rules for that business – Liechtenstein, the Cook Islands, Jersey – and use it as a nominal base.If you couldn’t find a jurisdiction with the right kind of rules, then you threatened or flattered one until it changed its rules to accommodate you. Warburg himself started this off, by explaining to the Bank of England that if Britain did not make its rules competitive and its taxes lower, then he would take his bank elsewhere, perhaps to Luxembourg.Hey presto, the rules were changed, and the tax – in this case, stamp duty on bearer bonds – was abolished. The world’s response to these developments has been entirely predictable as well. Time after time, countries have chased after the business they have lost offshore (as the US did by abolishing the regulations the banks were dodging when they moved to London), thus making the onshore world ever more similar to the offshore piratical world that Warburg’s bankers created.Taxes have fallen, regulations have relaxed, politicians have become friendlier, all in an effort to entice the restless money to settle in one jurisdiction rather than another. The reason for this is simple. Once one jurisdiction lets you do what you want, the business flows there and other jurisdictions have to rush to change, too. It is the Moneyland ratchet, always loosening regulations for the benefit of those with money to move around, and never tightening them.“It’s very easy for oligarchs of developing countries, non-democratic countries, to hide their wealth. That provides them with huge incentives to loot their countries, and there’s no oversight,” says Zucman.Come January, we will get another update of how much more of the world’s wealth these oligarchs have taken for themselves: the only surprise will be the precise volume of their new acquisition, and how little they have left for the rest of us. But we shouldn’t wait until then to grasp the urgency of the situation.We need to act now to shine a light on their wealth, on the dark matter whose gravitational power is bending the fabric of our societies. We may have been ignoring Moneyland, but its nomad citizens have not been ignoring us. If we wish to take back control of our economies, and our democracies, we need to act now. Every day that we wait, more money is stacked against us.Adapted from Moneyland: Why Thieves \u0026amp Crooks Now Rule The World \u0026amp How to Take It Back by Oliver Bullough, published by Profile Books• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cee50bdb3bb20d592d61ba056d6895bc920f54e/0_0_4570_2824/master/4570.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c6185eaa0ad762c886884c51c991a6d5","title":"karen bradley admits not understanding northern irish politics","story":"The Northern Ireland secretary says she was ‘slightly scared’ of the region before taking officeKaren Bradley has admitted that before becoming Northern Ireland secretary she was profoundly ignorant of the country’s political isions and “slightly scared” of the place.She said she was unaware that nationalists did not vote for unionists and that unionists did not vote for nationalists – the most elementary fact about Northern Ireland politics.“I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland,” Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament.“I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland – people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa. So, the parties fight for election within their own community.“Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.”Theresa May appointed Bradley to the post in January – succeeding James Brokenshire – at an exceptionally sensitive time because of Brexit and the breakdown in Stormont’s power-sharing government.Bradley’s admission prompted astonishment that she had risen so far in the Conservative party and government without knowing that Northern Ireland voters split along constitutional lines.Theresa May sent the former culture secretary to Belfast supposedly as a safe pair of hands. Bradley, 47, said Northern Ireland politics had seemed alien to her.“That’s a very different world from the world I came from where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative. That is so incredibly different and it’s when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”The Troubles had shaped her view of Northern Ireland and she had no idea how wonderful and vibrant the region was, she said. “I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today.”House magazine quoted Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, calling the admissions embarrassing. “Given this worrying lack of basic knowledge about Northern Ireland, it’s no wonder the Tories don’t seem to understand the vital importance of preventing a return of a hard border there.”Members of the Stormont assembly may not be in the mood to rush to the minister’s defence. On Thursday she said their pay will be slashed after 19 months if the devolved government is not restored.Their pay would fall from £49,500 to £35,888 in November, with another reduction of £6,187 three months later if the assembly did not resume its work, Bradley told MPs.She ruled out immediate elections for the devolved assembly, which has not operated since power sharing between the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed in January last year, and announced plans for civil servants to have more powers to implement policies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83d525c6de64d0e5e1c9e4f4fe465109b205d40a/578_120_2506_1504/master/2506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21bf292e2fc249985854f0ae73863e00","title":"tony blair not sure labour can be wrestled back from corbyn","story":"Former PM says voters will not accept choice between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris JohnsonTony Blair has said Labour has undergone a “profound change” since Jeremy Corbyn became leader and that he is not sure it is possible for “moderates” to regain control of the party.“It is a different type of Labour party.

Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

Within minutes Morgan Escare put the result beyond any doubt before Joe Greenwood scored in the final minutes to enhance the scoreline.Yet with the game set to decide the future of the Super 8s league format at the RFL’s extraordinary general meeting on Friday, Wigan’s first sub-10,000 crowd since July 2005 will have struck a chord with their owner, Ian Lenagan, who has made no secret of the fact the game is wilting under this structure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccdc2770d2045e1454edc2837eff51ebcf8e98b3/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4abb59ce5f34c70248d883638c5bdb","title":"nfl 2018 predictions mvp super bowl winner","story":"Will the Eagles repeat? Will Aaron Rodgers and Andrew Luck return to restore their teams’ fortunes? And who will go down in flames?The part I feel confident in saying is that it will come from the NFC. Teams from that conference won 41 out of 64 games against AFC opponents in 2017 and trades like the one that sent Khalil Mack from Oakland to Chicago are hardly redressing the balance. There’s a lot of hype around the Giants after they upgraded the line and added Saquon Barkley, but I’m not convinced they can bridge the gap in a year when the schedule looks grim. PBGreen Bay Packers. The thing about the Packers is that we don\u0027t know how healthy Aaron Rodgers will be. If he\u0027s playing like the Rodgers of old, they\u0027re absolutely making the playoffs. If he struggles, the Packers probably end up having a losing record. Let\u0027s split the difference here and say that Rodgers will be good, but not dominant, and Green Bay just miss the postseason. HFJacksonville. Jason Mendoza’s favorite team had the league’s easiest schedule during last year’s charmed run, their ision is much-improved and their quarterback is Blake Bortles. No sale. BAGThe Lions will be balanced and explosive. They finally have a talented offensive line, featuring, at worst, an above-average player at every spot. That’s a decided advantage given the state of groups across the league. Matthew Stafford is surrounded by a stack of weapons, too. Defense will be their fatal flaw: the Lions lack speed up front. In the modern NFL, such things matter. OCWith a healthy Aaron Rodgers, the Packers are a safe bet to be contenders once more. PBAfter trading for Jimmy Garoppolo last season, the 49ers ended their season on a 5-0 run. They thought the bounce was real enough to sign him to a historic five-year, $137.5m contract. Time will tell whether he ends up being more next big hype than next big hope, but it\u0027s hard to see them missing out on the playoffs if he plays like he did at the end of last season. HFGreen Bay. The Packers were among the NFC’s best teams last year when Aaron Rodgers went down for the season with a broken collarbone. They finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2008. They’ll be back. BAGThe Texans would have made the postseason last year were it not for Deshaun Watson’s injury. Health will be the issue again this season. If they can keep their stars on the field – Watson, JJ Watt, and Jadeveon Clowney – they will enter the playoffs as one of the top seeds in the AFC. OCAaron Rodgers made no secret at his sadness over the Packers’ decision to part ways with Jordy Nelson, but in Jimmy Graham he has a new red-zone target to enjoy. I’m expecting a big year from the quarterback as he bounces back from the injury that kept him out for most of the 2017 season. PBJimmy Garoppolo. At this point in NFL history, we assume that the MVP will be a quarterback. If my earlier prediction that Garoppolo will drag the 49ers to the playoffs practically by himself pans out, then he gets serious MVP consideration. It\u0027s also possible that the league has added incentive to hand the award to the current 49ers quarterback just to spite the former 49ers quarterback currently making the NFL\u0027s life difficult. HFRodgers. How lucky for Green Bay the best player in the sport plays the most important position. Every year he’s healthy, the Packers are among the last teams standing in January. BAGAndrew Luck! He will bounce back to pre-injury levels, leading to all sorts of hyperbole and hardware. Luck is playing on the worst roster in a tough ision. If he can drag the Colts to the postseason, he will have earned the award. OCSaquon Barkley is the obvious choice, for both talent and opportunity in a Giants offense that has been so long without a viable running game. So just to be contrary, I’ll take Broncos pass rusher Bradley Chubb, who looked sharp in preseason and should not face too many double teams with Von Miller lined up on the other side. PBThe Giants picked Barkley second overall in this year’s draft, something which is nearly unheard of considering how running backs are typically valued in the modern NFL. Given where the Giants drafted him, they expect that Barkley will start producing immediately and, if he does, it’s possible that he will run away with rookie of the year honors. HFBarkley. The Giants will be terrible again but they have a top-five offense on paper and the Penn State career all-purpose yards leader will be responsible for a lion’s share of it. BAGGiven his position and the market he plays in, I think this is Sam Darnold’s award to lose. However, I think the two most impactful rookies will be Denzel Ward (CB, Browns) and Josh Jackson (CB, Packers). Jackson has an outside shot of clinching the award because he’ll be playing in big-time games on the national stage, a requirement for non-quarterbacks or running backs. And he’s more likely to top young corners in the big metrics: interceptions, passes defended etc. OCA team playing in a city that wants to sue it? Yes, this can only end well. PBWe\u0027re going to see the end of the Roger Goodell Era. At a certain point, there will be enough public pressure on Goodell from all sides that he realizes it\u0027s just not worth it to remain as NFL commissioner. Maybe it will happen because of how he\u0027s handling the anthem controversy. Maybe it will happen when yet another star player gets caught committing a horrific act of abuse and the league\u0027s response ends up being appallingly inadequate. Whatever it is, it feels like at some point this season, an overwhelmed Goodell is going to accept a golden parachute offer and make a hasty but profitable exit. May God have mercy on whoever ends up having to clean up his mess. HFThere’s no fun in being right about these things. But trouble never seems to be far behind Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston, who’s already starting the season on a three-game suspension for allegedly groping an Uber driver. BAGHow about … Johnny Manziel. Look at the state of back-up quarterbacks around the league. Somebody is going to talk themselves into Manziel at some point during the season, particularly if we get a spate of injuries. Manziel will suit up for at least one drive this season. It won’t go well. OCThe Colts will make the postseason. OK, this prediction relies entirely on Andrew Luck staying healthy, but in seasons when he starts 15 or more games, Indianapolis have gone 11-5, 11-5, 11-5, 8-8. People forget quite what a game-changer he is. Yes, there are lots of questions elsewhere on this roster, and his health is far from a certainty. But Frank Reich is a fine offensive coach, and the Colts did at least try to upgrade the pass protection this offseason. I can see a path to nine or 10 wins for this team in a shallow AFC. PBThis is going to sound like heresy here in New England, but there\u0027s a very real chance we see Tom Brady, who just turned 41, decline this season. No we haven\u0027t seen significant signs of trouble yet but, as we saw with Peyton Manning, when the end comes in the NFL, it comes quick. HFThe tricked-out Los Angeles Rams are coming off an 11-5 season and have emerged as a trendy Super Bowl pick, but they’ll be doomed by a lack of chemistry and miss the playoffs as the San Francisco 49ers win NFC West. BAGJacksonville trade for Tyrod Taylor. Cleveland will start the season with Taylor at quarterback, but Baker Mayfield is primed to takeover. The Browns will use the first few weeks of the season to pump-up Taylor’s trade value. Taylor represents an upgrade over Bortles. If the Jacksonville quarterback struggles early, the Jags should seek a deal. OCBe misrepresented by opponents as a protest against the national anthem andor American values. PBContinue to be the biggest storyline in football. It\u0027s clear that the NFL\u0027s attempts to determine the proper punishment for protesting players just reignited the controversy. It\u0027s going to be another long season for the stick to sports crowd. HFMake national headlines beyond the sports page as Trump hits the campaign trail to stump for his endorsees ahead of the midterm elections, which take place right after the season’s halfway mark. BAGLead to the decertification of the NFLPA. At this point, it feels like it’s the players’ only option if they want to make significant, long lasting changes. The NFL’s middle class is declining. Elite players smartly used holdouts this preseason to get major paydays. Rookie contracts are as valuable and cost-effective as ever. Players in the middle, still the majority of the league, continue to lose their leverage. That, plus the bad will towards the owners and commissioner, could lead the players towards a drastic step. OCEven if Brady does lose a step or two in the upcoming season, it shouldn\u0027t be enough to prevent the Patriots from winning their ision. Bill Belichick is still the head coach and the competition in the AFC East once again doesn\u0027t look likely to provide much competition. HFNew England. We’ve seen cracks in the Brady-Belichick-Kraft triumvirate over the past two years and the three-time MVP quarterback, who turned 41 last month, will inevitably slow down at some point. But the baked-in advantage of a trash ision all but ensures a 15th AFC East title in 17 seasons for the Patriots. BAGNobody in AFC East has caught up with the Patriots … yet. New England’s biggest flaw in the past couple of years has been speed in the front-seven. They added Adrian Clayborn in free agency and see Derek Rivers return, an edge-rusher who missed his rookie season with a knee injury. Those names might not mean a great deal to you right now, but they are improvements to the weakest part of an already loaded team. OCBetween Le’Veon Bell’s extended holdout, the Ryan Shazier-shaped hole in the middle of the defense and Ben Roethlisberger’s 14 seasons of wear and tear, it is no foregone conclusion that the Steelers retain their ision crown. But if the running back does return to the field in time for week one, then they will once again be hard to beat. PBThis might be the toughest call in the AFC, as the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens should both be equally tough outs, no matter who they\u0027re playing. The Steelers, however, just seem like a scarier team. Maybe the edge is that Roethlisberger has that uncanny knack of completing plays despite being pulled apart by the opposing defense while Joe Flacco is … Joe Flacco. HFPittsburgh. Anyone but the Steelers, where bona fide stars Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Bell (maybe) will feature, would be a surprise after winning four of the last five AFC North titles, although an improved Baltimore side will likely challenge for a wild-card spot. BAGI’m all for the excitement in Cleveland. The team has youth, talent, and exciting players on both sides of the ball. Baltimore may have the top defense in the league at any rate it’s the most versatile. And keep an eye on Cincinnati. The Bengals are sliding under-the-radar. They have as fearsome a pass-rush as anyone, and just enough explosiveness on offense to make opponents worry. Still, this is the Steelers’ ision to lose. The only thing I can see derailing Pittsburgh is another injury to Roethlisberger. OCI’ve already made my case for the Colts as a more competitive team than many have predicted. Houston ought to be stronger, too, with Deshaun Watson and JJ Watt both back from injury. Tennessee won nine games last year and made useful additions on either side of the ball in Dion Lewis and Malcolm Butler. The Jaguars are still my pick, though, thanks to that suffocating D. PBThis ision feels like it\u0027s going to go down to who manages to have a comeback player of the year caliber season. If Luck plays like a franchise quarterback again, the Colts have the edge. If Watt plays like the force he once was, the Texans could take control of the ision. I like Watt\u0027s chances. HFHouston. The emerging star Watson should pick up where he left off before getting injured last year. Watt is back, too. Throw in the additions of Tyrann Mathieu and Aaron Colvin and the Texans should have enough to overtake the Jaguars. BAGWith Watson back in the fold and a star-studded defense at every level, the Texans have the makings of a ision champion. There are issues around the edges: Houston’s offensive line has less talent than any in the league depth on defense is an issue. Health will likely be the deciding factor. OCThe Chiefs’ season may come down to how good Patrick Mahomes ends up being in his first full year at quarterback, but this feels like a team that can pick up enough wins in the regular season to capture the ision and then go on to suffer an Andy Reid-assisted flameout in their first playoff game. HFThe Chargers. Philip Rivers is back at the stick of last year’s top-ranked passing offense and the defense is better than it gets credit for. They finished strong, winning nine of their last 12 games after going winless in September. It should be enough to end Kansas City’s two-year reign atop the ision. BAGPreseason injuries have tortured the Chargers, again. Still, LA are poised for a deep playoff run They still have the top edge-rushing duo in the league, a great secondary and a seasoned quarterback. OCWhen will Carson Wentz return to the field? Can he perform at the same MVP level that he achieved before his injury last year? Does it really matter, given that the Eagles won the Super Bowl with Nick Foles anyway, and beefed up an imposing defensive line rotation with Michael Bennett and Haloti Ngata since then? PBThe reigning world champions should be the favorites to once again to win their ision. It will be interesting to see how things go with Wentz set to take the reins back from Foles, but that probably goes into the category of Good Problems To Have. HFPhiladelphia. It’s been 13 years since a team in the NFL’s glamour ision has won it twice in a row, but there’s every reason to believe the Eagles will break the schneid. They’re deep on both lines, they’ve added a couple nice pieces on defense (including Michael Bennett and Sidney Jones) and Wentz was playing at an MVP level until he went down to injury. BAGThe Eagles should go back-to-back. They have an embarrassment of riches all over the field. Watch for second-year cornerback Sidney Jones. He missed his entire rookie year with an achilles injury. If he bounces back to his pre-injury level, he will be an instant star. Of course, all this presupposes that Wentz returns in week three. If not, Philly will be in trouble. OCThe Vikings won 13 games last season and believe they will be better with Kirk Cousins behind center and a healthy Dalvin Cook in the backfield. But as long as the Packers have an upright Aaron Rodgrs, they’re going to be hard to pick against. PBIt feels weird picking the team that will be starting Cousins over the team starting Rodgers, but the latter is a question mark and Minnesota feel like they are going to win out thanks to the talent they have on the defensive end of the ball. It wouldn\u0027t be a huge surprise if the ision comes down to tiebreakers, however. HFMinnesota. One could argue the splashy addition of free-agent quarterback Kirk Cousins to a team coming off a 13-3 campaign made the Vikings the NFL’s most complete team. But the Packers, benefitting from the return of Rodgers and a revamped defense, will push them till the end. BAGThis is a true toss-up. The Bears trading for Khalil Mack changes the entire dynamic of the ision. Vic Fangio is coming for Mike Zimmer’s best-defense-in-the-ision crown. Chicago are young and have lethal speed at every level of its defense. Out in Green Bay, there’s that Aaron Rodgers guy to deal with. And you can’t rule out the Lions making a run, either. On balance, though, I like the Vikings’ chances. They’re the more proven team on either side of the ball. Kirk Cousins represents an upgrade over Case Keenum at quarterback. Dalvin Cook returning from injury will help push Minnesota over the top. OCHey, remember how the Saints were one miracle play away from going to the NFC Championship game last year? Yeah, they really haven’t lost a lot of pieces since. This will be another very competitive ision, but a team that can turn to Drew Brees when the running game isn’t working, rather than the other way around, is a team in very rude health indeed. PBThe Saints signed Brees to a two-year extension back in March with the hope that he had at least one more season of playing like Drew Effing Brees in him. While he\u0027s eyeing records held by legends like Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, one has to think that his goal will be returning to the Super Bowl. It\u0027s not out of the question. HFFormer MVP Matt Ryan leads an Atlanta Falcons offense featuring an embarrassment of riches, among them Julio Jones, Devonta Freeman, Tevin Coleman, Mohamed Sanu, Austin Hooper and Justin Hardy. No shortage of playmakers on defense, either. New Orleans and Carolina should contend but look for the Falcons to contend for the NFC’s top overall seed. BAGI have no confidence in this pick. I love the offense that has been put together in New Orleans. But I still don’t entirely trust all the young pups on defense. Granted, I hardly trust Steve Sarkisian calling plays for Atlanta’s offense, but I trust it a little more. Side note: I think Tampa have the potential to be a true dumpster fire. OCI’ve picked Gurley and Donald to win player of the year awards already. It feels like a stretch to suggest that anyone other than the Rams would win this ision if they do. PBCould the Rams end up being good enough this season to actually get Los Angeles to buy into them? Maybe not, but they have the opportunity to stay in the public consciousness long enough that people stop forgetting that they no longer play in St Louis. HFThe 49ers started 1-10 before Jimmy Garoppolo got a chance under center and closed out with five straight wins. If the Rams’ bold gamble to reach the Super Bowl doesn’t pay off, look for the Niners to take advantage. BAGThe Rams have transformed the nature of the NFC West in a couple of years thanks to a pair of coaching hires (Sean McVay and Wade Phillips) and a raft of free-agent moves and trades. Do win-now moves always work out? No. But the Rams were smart with who they targeted this offseason. They reenforced strengths and improved upon weakness. Their secondary reads like an All-Pro list. Their defensive line is even better. The 49ers will push them close, but ultimately the Rams have too much quality to disappoint. OCRavens and Colts. PBRavens and Jaguars. HFChiefs and Ravens. BAGJaguars and Colts. OCVikings and Bears. PB49ers and Panthers. HFSaints and Packers. BAGPackers and 49ers. OCRams over Patriots. After becoming the NFL’s youngest head coach in modern history, and then the youngest coach of the year, Sean McVay completes the set by becoming the youngest to win a Super Bowl as well. Better yet, he does it against the most successful of them all. PBSteelers over Saints. Old guy quarterback showdown! Roethlisberger will be 36. Brees will be 40! As a game, however, it might end up being anticlimactic. One can imagine Brees burying Pittsburgh in touchdowns, picking up MVP honors and announcing his retirement live on television. At least that\u0027s the Hollywood ending, we should know by now that Super Bowl games rarely follow the script. HFEagles over Patriots. It’s down to Carson Wentz, really. But if Philadelphia’s third-year quarterback makes a full recovery from his knee injury and can regain the MVP form he showed during his breakout sophomore campaign (where he threw for 33 touchdowns against only seven interceptions), the Eagles will become the first team in more than a decade to repeat as Super Bowl champions. BAGVikings over Patriots. Dumping Case Keenum for Kirk Cousins pays off. The Vikings’ skill-positions are as talented as any group in the league. Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen might be the best two-man receiving tandem around. Dalvin Cook is a special talent. Add that offense to a top-tier defense and you have a potent championship formula. I have the Patriots suffering another heartbreaker in the Super Bowl. There are concerns with their receiving group and offensive tackle spots. But they still have Brady at the peak of his powers, and a potentially frisky defense that has filled in its holes. No other team in the AFC has the same proven quality.

He charges Jadeja, tries to flick to leg and gets a leading edge that loops over cover for two. Jadeja has started well and is likely to do a lot of bowling today.“Afternoon Rob,” says Rob Fowkes. “That PCA video: I didn’t think it was possibly to love Moeen even more, but then he goes and refers to Cooky as ‘Chefry Dujon’. And with that, I’m spent.”21st over: England 57-0 (Cook 30, Jennings 21) Shami is bowling a decent spell from around the wicket. A single takes Cook into the thirties for the first time in this series. It’s all very quiet out there.“I, too , was at the WACA in 2006, and had the pleasure of meeting Alastair Cook at Coco’s restaurant on the far side of the Swan River,” says Robert Cookson. “I was also there to witness Sir Geoffrey, marching to his table, full voice, talking down to Cook as only he could, telling him, at full voice as he sat there eating a meal with his girlfriend, about how he had ‘panicked’ once he got his hundred. (No mention of McGrath bowling some of the best overs he ever delivered.) Cook took it all with characteristic good grace. He was probably the only one in the place who didn’t want to tell Sir Geoffrey to stick his ‘advice’ up his… well you get the rest.” Bless Geoffrey. What he lacks in tact he more than makes up for in encyclopaedic knowledge of his own career. 20th over: England 56-0 (Cook 29, Jennings 21) Jadeja has an LBW appeal turned down when Cook misses a sweep. He was outside the line. There’s already a little bit in this pitch for Jadeja, and he could be really dangerous in the second innings. He is a brilliant bowler on turning pitches.This is a good point from Chris Savory. “Re Alastair Cook going back to Essex and scoring millions of runs (over three), I almost hope from England’s POV that it doesn’t work out that way. Look how quickly Ian Bell’s name still gets brought up every time our middle order struggles, despite his fairly average county record over the last two years (matches vs Glamorgan aside). With an Ashes series next summer, two newinexperienced openers in the side, and a still-only-34yo Cook effortlessly racking up centuries for Essex each week, how long before all anyone can talk about is recalling him to the side?”19th over: England 55-0 (Cook 28, Jennings 21) Jennings drives Shami for two to move into the twenties. He looks calm and solid and will be really annoyed if he doesn’t cash in today. The openers on both sides have earned a pitch like this after having such a torrid time in the first four Tests.  “My favourite Cook memory was sitting, freezing, at Chester-le-Street on Spring Bank Holiday Monday 2016 after the Sri Lankans managed to set us 70-odd to win,” says Ben Powell. “During his innings Cook scored his 10,000th Test run. The far from mighty crowd rose as one and I’ve always been disappointed that as the camera pans across the largely empty stands, it stops just short of where I sat, in splendid isolation, looking as happy as any cricket fan who’s not brought enough layers, whose hands and turning blue and who is raising his third pint of the day in the general direction of the square.”  18th over: England 53-0 (Cook 28, Jennings 18) Jadeja has three men round the bat for Cook: slip, leg slip and short leg. Cook squirts a single to bring up the fifty partnership.“I first saw Alastair Cook bat when my future wife and I went to watch Yorkshire v Essex (her county v. my county) in 2004, his first full first-class season,” says Tim Sanders. “He walked out to bat with the very tall Will Jefferson, and scored a good 50. Andy Flower and Darren Lehmann, the future coaches from the 2013-14 Ashes, were playing too. A futuristic fixture all-round.”Tell it to Adrian George Agustus Mathew McCoubrey.17th over: England 49-0 (Cook 27, Jennings 16) “I’ve just realised that I have virtually no memories of Alastair Cook,” says Robert Ellson (again). “I really don’t mean this churlishly. Which makes me think two things. 1) Has there ever been such a great player who was so unobtrusive? Graeme Smith? 2) It would be really good if Test cricket came back to FTA. Cook’s whole career has been behind the paywall: the first significant England cricketer of whom that’s true?”Yes, him and Monty Panesar I guess, with Stuart Broad just after them. Monty isn’t behind the paywall anymore, as anyone who watched Celebrity Masterchef from behind the sofa last night will confirm.16th over: England 48-0 (Cook 26, Jennings 16) Ravindra Jadeja comes into the attack. He caused Cook a lot of trouble in the return series 18 months ago, dismissing him six times in 10 innings. His second ball, speared down the leg side, beats everyone and goes for four byes. Then Jennings pulls out the reverse sweep, nailing it round the corner for four. That’s a good shot, and a brave one too because you can imagine the pelters should he get out playing such a modern stroke.15th over: England 39-0 (Cook 25, Jennings 12) Mohammed Shami’s first ball is edged along the ground for four by Cook. If England manage to collapse today, on this pitch, they will all deserve MBEs for services to comedy. The pitch is so flat.“Can confirm Jennings niftily sidestepped the guard of honour,” says Robert Ellson. “Comfortably his best piece of foot movement of the summer. Arf.”14th over: England 32-0 (Cook 18, Jennings 12) The debutant Hanuma Vihari comes into the attack. He’s an occasional offspinner, with 19 wickets at 40 in 63 first-class matches), and I doubt he’s come on first change too often. A quiet first over, and it’s drinks.“Morning Rob,” says Jules Spencer. “Amongst the deluge of sentiment bestowed on Cook this week, I presume you have seen Jimmy’s contribution at 8mins 20secs in the PCA video you posted at 10.25 this morning. It really is rather good.”13th over: England 31-0 (Cook 17, Jennings 12) That’s the ball of the morning from Bumrah, a trampolining legcutter from around the wicket that beats Jennings all ends up. The last ball is too straight and flicked to fine leg for four by Jennings.“I’ve applied, unsuccessfully, for compassionate leave from work to attend the Oval today to witness Alastair Cook’s last Test match - so I’m emailing you instead,” says Patrick Ford. “It has been 12 years of total man-love. I was lucky enough to see his 116 at the Waca back in 2006, and to be on a gap yah in 2010-11 to witness his cricketing apotheosis. And I was there at the MCG last December for his final hurrah. I have great memories of freezing cold mornings in late 2012 where I’d re-read the  OBO feed of his latest mammoth century from India. Above all, though, I have enjoyed listening to his accent get bizarrely more Essex with every passing season. I’m not sure how I’ll cope without him...”You’ll get your fix when he becomes the surprise new star of The Only Way Is Essex.12th over: England 27-0 (Cook 17, Jennings 8) Cook, reaching for a wide outswinger from Sharma, squirts it in the air through the vacant gully region. That’s all folks.“Personally,” says Richard O’Hagan, “I would’ve given Border a guard of honour just to annoy him.”Brian McMillan could have been waiting at the top, posing playfully with the same gun he brought into the Australian dressing-room during that tour. 11th over: England 26-0 (Cook 17, Jennings 7) Bumrah goes around the wicket in an attempt to elicit an actual shot from Jennings. It works, though it’s only a defensive stroke. He takes a single from the last ball of the over, albeit a very dodgy one - Cook would have been well short with a direct hit from point.“Morning Rob, morning everyone,” says Michael Avery. “I can’t explain quite why this brings me so much joy, but when Alastair Cook scored the run that brought him his double century in the Brisbane Test of 2010-11, he also brought England’s total to 4321. Over 131 for anyone who wishes to check.”10th over: England 25-0 (Cook 17, Jennings 6) Jennings is leaving as many deliveries as possible and has shown good judgement of his off stump. It helps that the ball is unlikely to boomerang back into him or scuttle along the floor as it did in the last Test. This is a great chance for him to get a significant score.The lack of pace in the pitch is demonstrated when Jennings ducks into a bouncer from Sharma that thuds into the side of the helmet. He seems fine and doesn’t bother with a concussion check. I thought they were mandatory? Anyway.“Hi Rob,” says Richard Woods. “Given the discussions all summer surrounding England’s future openers, what price England 301-0 at the close?” I’ll give you 301-1.Meanwhile, you want a County Cricket live blog? Yeah, bet you do.9th over: England 24-0 (Cook 17, Jennings 6) Sod it, let’s go: it’s on! Cook cuts and pulls Bumrah for consecutive boundaries to move within 83 of his century. They were two cracking shots, played with an end-of-term flourish. This pitch looks a belter.“Hi Rob,” says Felix Wood. “With this Test match the glorious summer, like Cook’s great England career, is coming to an end. Feels a bit melancholic, really. So, as I believe is customary on the internet, I’m going to avoid this by provoking pointless argument: Cook, knowing he was going to retire, should have not played this match. He is depriving his successor of making a debut or comeback on a relatively benign pitch in a meaningless fixture rather than having to do it on a raging bunsen in Sri Lanka. Selfish.”I understand that view, but I couldn’t agree less. This stuff about there being no sentiment in sport you might as well say there’s no sentiment in life. 8th over: England 16-0 (Cook 9, Jennings 6) “Fair point about the guard of honour, it can be a bit much,” says Niall Mullen. “But let’s remember that if it was John Terry out there he’d bat to his average and then retire unbeaten but simultaneously shamelessly and shamefully.”I don’t mind the guard of honour at all. It’s the stuff around it BREAKING NEWS: ALASTAIR COOK HAS ARRIVED AT THE OVAL that can be a bit much. 7th over: England 16-0 (Cook 9, Jennings 6) The ball is doing nothing, the pitch is slow and India don’t have the same furious intensity they showed in the last two Tests. I’m not here to tempt fate, not on today of all days. All I’ll say is that if batting was my job, I would fancy a long day at the office. “Hello Rob,” says Aditi Prabhudesai. “Undoubtedly my favorite Cook moment was the over in which he bowled and bagged the wicket of Ishant Sharma. His unrestrained delight while celebrating was very infectious. Also, and I am sure you will agree Rob, it’s especially heartwarming that he stays away from social media.”6th over: England 13-0 (Cook 8, Jennings 4) A maiden from Sharma, in which Cook is beaten outside off stump. It’s been a very quiet start. “When did the guard of honour become a thing?” asks Gary Naylor. “The first I can recall was for Curtly and Courtney at the Oval in 2000, but I may have missed some earlier, distracted by a glass or two. I know the Don got one here, but a lot about him was unique.”Yes, Curtly and Courtney is the first one I can recall. I suppose the world has become more sentimental. I can’t imagine, for example, Brian McMillan and Kepler Wessels giving Allan Border a guard of honour, or Border wanting one.5th over: England 13-0 (Cook 8, Jennings 4) The pitch looks a bit slow and there hasn’t been any movement in the air or off the pitch. The early impression is that these are some of the better batting conditions of the series. Saying which, Jennings is beaten on the drive by Bumrah.4th over: England 13-0 (Cook 8, Jennings 4) Cook clips Sharma through midwicket for four, a slice of bread and butter that has sustained him throughout his career.“My favourite Cook memory comes from seemingly eons ago, Rob,” says Bill Hargreaves. “A friend who was coaching cricket at St. Edwards in Oxford (he’d kept wicket for the uni so knew a thing or two) spotted a young batsmen playing for Bedford School who he said was amazing. He said that every time he took to the field he seemed to get a century and to watch out for him - name: Alastair Cook.”3rd over: England 9-0 (Cook 4, Jennings 4) Jennings survives a hopeful LBW appeal from a Bumrah delivery that pitched well outside leg. I suspect he’ll go on the winter tour if he gets any kind of score in this match. He’s probably a better player of spin than pace, and the likelihood is that England will face some vile turners in Sri Lanka.“I’m sure a lot of people are going to heap praise on Alastair Cook but the thing that impresses me is he’s going back to Essex next season as I think he feels he owes them a whole season and hopefully a bucketful of runs,” says Dave Brown. “A beacon of decency is our Cookie!”At least one season, no? He could score millions of runs in county cricket in the next five years. Mind you, I thought the same about his Test career when he gave up the captaincy.2nd over: England 7-0 (Cook 3, Jennings 3) Only Morne Morkel has dismissed Cook in Tests more often than Ishant Sharma, who will share the new ball. Cook gets off the mark with a nice cover drive for three. That brings Keaton Jennings on strike. This is a significant Test for him too, and he also gets off the mark with a crisp cover drive for three.“Morning,” says Smylers. “The 6yo still hasn’t managed to watch any England cricket, for a variety of reasons (rain my accidentally volunteering to help at the PTA fair and, most inexplicably, England winning a Test match in three days), so when Ilkley Literature Festival announced “Moeen Ali comes to the town”, I said we could go. Then the festival programme was published, and, while most of the events are a short walk from our home, it turns out Moeen’s is actually at a private school miles away. And on a Sunday, when public transport is sufficiently infrequent that by bus and train it will take us a 5¼-hour round-trip for the 1-hour talk. So I was wondering if by any chance there happens to be an Ilkley-based OBO reader who’s driving to Moeen’s talk and would be prepared to squeeze us in for some petrol money?”Can anyone help? If so, let me know and I’ll pass your email on.Please do send in your favourite Cook memories today. Anything you like. Here comes Alastair Cook, one penultimate time, to a standing ovation from the Oval crowd. He receives a guard of honour from the Indian players and a handshake from Virat Kohli. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that at the start of a match.I didn’t see whether Keaton Jennings walked through or round the guard of honour. He should have done a Derek Zoolander.‘We’ll have to look at the data’“A word about Moeen Ali, if I may…” says Richard Shinn. “When he made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in 2014, he was selected as a specialist batsman who could provide a few overs of spin when required. However, his performances with the ball surprised many, and in my opinion this began to confuse the selectors as to his exact role in the England team. The success of Moeen’s spin bowling (combined with the lack of alternatives in the country) has kept him his place over the past four years. However, it has also undermined his role as a batsman in the team. To me, he’ll always be a reluctant (yet possessing a golden arm) spin bowler and a hugely talented, free-spirited top order batsman. Finally it looks like the management team are recognising this!”I wouldn’t be too hopeful. I’m sure he’ll bat in the top order this winter but it’s hard to see him batting No3 in the Ashes next summer. In an age of rotation, I have no real problem with Moeen being a utility player. He certainly has the temperament for it. “Why are we not discussing the elephant in the room?” says Sreekanth Nandakumar. “Kohli has lost the fifth and final toss in the series and India have more or less have lost this match as they can’t chase anything above 50 runs. I know those are ifs and buts but if India had won at least one toss, I am sure the scoreline would not have been 4-1.”India will win this match. You have my word. England are unchanged, though Jonny Bairstow resumes his role as wicketkeeper. Hanuma Vihari makes his debut for India. He has a modest first-class batting average of 59.79. Vihari replaces Hardik Pandya, while Ravindra Jadeja comes in for the injured Ravichandran Ashwin.Joe Root completes a whitewash of tosses. The pitch is grassy so it could be a tough morning for England, but it’s dry underneath and they have two spinners.The circle of Test cricketThere have been a lot of Cook stats going round in the last few days. This is my favourite: the most deliveries faced in Test cricket since Cook made his debut on 1 March 2006. Cook has faced 46 per cent more than anyone else. 46 per cent*. No wonder he has nothing left in the tank.* Thanks to Ally Macsporran and Lorraine Reese for pointing out my crap maths.Graham Gooch never won any awards for quotability. What this blog presupposes is ... maybe he should have done? Gooch’s observations about cricket contain an earthy lyricism that few cricketers can match:On 5 Live this week, Gooch was talking about Alastair Cook when he referred to “the department of run-making”. It’s not an elegant phrase – but it’s certainly an eloquent one, because it perfectly captured the cold, businesslike nature of Cook’s batting. Gooch has another phrase to describe that approach: “It’s not how, it’s how many.”For the next few days we get to say farewell to Cook, a strange kind of hero: sometimes gauche, never exhilarating, but a player of the rarest substance and the kind of man who makes you want to be a better person. We’ll remember him for many things. Longevity, mental strength, dignity and stubbornness in the face of a disgraceful witchhunt four years ago, the leave outside off stump, another leave outside off stump. And for those beautiful Proustian rushes in number form: 235, 294, 766, 2012-13.As for this match, it’s a dead rubber to most of us – but not to those who live and breathe ranking points, or to Virat Kohli. England are traditionally hopeless at keeping the foot on the throat, in any sport, so I fancy India to win this match and give the series a more appropriate scoreline. It would be a bit of a travesty if India lose 4-1.Cook will go out on a high whatever happens, because the series is won and he is at peace. Very few players get to retire in such happy circumstances. But let’s be clear about this. There are final highs and final highs. The goodwill and the guard of honour are guaranteed the feelgood hundred is not. We’ll soon find out who writes Cook’s scripts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ef69917597d6f01e2223ce27e2e91528ed995d2/0_36_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f1a122a887af44bc23fc3619dbf9661","title":"twitter permanently bans conspiracy theorist alex jones","story":"One month after it distinguished itself from the rest of the tech industry by declining to bar the rightwing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from its platform, Twitter fell in line Thursday, permanently banning the accounts of both Jones and his website Infowars.“We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts’ past violations,” the company tweeted. “We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban.”The company does not usually comment on inidual accounts, but said it “wanted to be open about this action given the broad interest in this case”. The two accounts had about 1.3 million followers combined.The decision comes just 24 hours after both Jones and Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, spent the day on Capitol Hill, where Dorsey testified before committees of the House and Senate and Jones roamed the hallways, accosting politicians and reporters.The 44-year-old Jones is perhaps best known for spreading a conspiracy theory that has resulted in years of harassment for the parents of victims of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. His broadcasts and website feature a mix of false information, hate-mongering, conspiracy theories and general ranting.Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Spotify and Apple Podcasts all allowed Jones to use their platforms to build his following until this summer, when a reporter from CNN, Oliver Darcy, publicly asked Facebook to explain how it could claim to combat hate speech and misinformation while continuing to amplify Jones.Facebook prevaricated until early August, when a decision by Apple to remove Infowars from its podcasting app precipitated a storm of bans from social media platforms. Twitter was the sole high-profile holdout.“We’re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,” Dorsey tweeted at the time.On 15 August, Jones’s account was temporarily suspended for abusive tweets.Twitter did not explain exactly how Jones had violated its rules this time, but during his trip to the Capitol, Jones got into an altercation with the Florida senator Marco Rubio and used Twitter’s video app Periscope to broadcast himself yelling at Darcy for about 10 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110c2aac6d7778396468851c1961dd005014b0f9/0_107_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91a2e2da484c336fd7d4808f573c75cb","title":"reader it is glorious watching vladimir putins own tv show","story":"State-run TV channel Rossiya 1 has begun airing a show dedicated to the Russian leader’s softer side. We asked a writer to watch it and report backWell, it looks like I have to tear up my list of the year’s best TV shows. Until now, the list had been populated by all the usual suspects – agonisingly self-conscious dramas, single-camera comedies that don’t have any jokes in them, that sort of thing – but now they are all in the bin, because I have just watched the first episode of the new Russian series Moscow. Kremlin. Putin. And, let me tell you, it is something else.Airing weekly on state-run Rossiya 1, Moscow. Kremlin. Putin is billed as a programme devoted to Vladimir Putin’s activities. Wherever he goes, the cameras follow, although it is often hard to see him thanks to all the fawning aides hurling themselves at his feet like a human carpet.You might have heard about Moscow. Kremlin. Putin before. You might have read, in this publication, how it’s been compared to a “Soviet-era personality cult”. You may have heard about the segment in which we see Putin on holiday in Siberia, where a Kremlin spokesperson claims that all bears are frightened of him. You might have even got curious and clicked around on Google Translate, finding Russian-language articles that call the show “brainwashing” and claim that it only exists as a desperate attempt to counter Putin’s plummeting approval ratings.But I have actually watched it. I tracked it down on YouTube and sat through an entire hour of it, despite not being able to speak any Russian. Reader, it is glorious.The first thing to note is that The Day Today never aired in Russia. Over here, the relentless macho bombast of that show’s title sequence permanently altered how news is presented here, forcing the BBC to scale back its giant self-important statues of ice eagles to something deliberately softer and warmer.But this lack of corrective means Russian news never had to back down, which makes Moscow. Kremlin. Putin’s titles flat-out incredible. There are ice birds and ice palaces and a noise that sounds like an industrial consignment of drums fighting for their life inside an exploding firework factory. But better yet is the entrance of host Vladimir Solovyov, who scowlingly marches out into a vast hangar-sized studio wearing the sort of all-black kung fu formalwear favoured by late-era Steven Seagal.He is exclusively alpha. He is every father of every girl you ever went out with as a teenager. He – and this is made perfectly clear by every atom of his appearance and demeanour – wants to beat the absolute snot out of you with his bare hands as soon as he is able to. Weirdly, the bristling aggression of the presentation – three minutes in, in one of the most phallic television segments I have ever witnessed, a reporter swoons aside a gargantuan dump truck – is nowhere to be seen when the focus turns to Putin himself.We see Putin patting babies. We see him sniffing mushrooms. We see him bobbing about inside a hilariously tiny boat. We see him smiling and giggling in front of a teenage audience. At one point we see him gazing impassively as a quarry is blown up before his eyes. He looks, to all the world, like a total pussycat. If he is a Bond villain, Moscow. Kremlin. Putin wants to make it clear that he is one of the nice ones, who probably has a National Trust membership. It takes work to make one man look this toothless, so credit where it\u0027s due to Moscow. Kremlin. Putin for putting the hours in.Obviously, Moscow. Kremlin. Putin could be better. The overwhelming majority of it is comprised of Solovyov standing at a Perspex lectern, yelling at a succession of men who look exactly like him, standing behind their own lecterns. This feels like an error. People watch Moscow. Kremlin. Putin to see Putin pad around Russia like a pussycat. More of that next week, please.Let’s have a segment where he pulls a thorn from the paw of a wounded antelope. Let’s have a segment where he visits a hospital and heals the sick with his hands. Let’s, for the love of God, have a segment where he sits down and makes a macrame cushion cover for the infirm. Give the people what they want, Rossiya 1.And BBC One, what the hell are you playing at? Where’s London. Westminster. May? Where’s our state-sanctioned hour of uncritical leader worship? If this country was worth anything at all, we would have a weekly programme dedicated to nothing but what a graceful and elegant dancer Theresa May is. But no.

Although the three leaders are also discussing plans for reconstruction, the return of refugees and the fate of Kurds in Syria, the focus is Russia’s determination to oversee a capture of Idlib by force.The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is also urging Russia to hold off and to return to talks in Geneva that he has prepared for next week on a future constitution for Syria.The warning of evidence of an imminent chemical attack was made by the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey. The US has repeatedly said it will not tolerate a chemical attack but has not said how it would respond.Jeffrey said: “I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings. Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation. There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared.”Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has massed his army and allied forces on the frontlines in the north-west, and Russian planes have joined his bombardment of rebels there – the prelude to a possible assault.Jeffrey said: “I think the last chapter of the Idlib story has not been written. The Turks are trying to find a way out. The Turks have shown a great deal of resistance to an attack.”He said the US had repeatedly asked Russia whether Washington could “operate” in Idlib to eliminate the last holdouts of jihadist groups. Asked whether that would include US air strikes, Jeffrey said: “That would be one way.”Turkey has established 12 observation posts around Idlib – an area of 6,000 sq km that is home to about 3 million people – as part of a de-escalation agreement it negotiated with Iran and Russia in the so-called Astana process. During the Tehran meeting Russia will seek to persuade Turkey to withdraw its troops.Russia and Syria justify the proposed attack on the basis that a large number of jihadists fighters, mainly from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, operate in Idlib. HTS and its satellites are deemed a terrorist organisation by the UN and as such are not party to any ceasefire.Large numbers of militants have been bussed to Idlib with the Syrian government’s permission following the collapse of previous rebel enclaves such as Homs, Aleppo and eastern Ghouta.Some of these groups are openly hostile to Turkey, making the efforts of Erdoğan to persuade these groups to leave that much harder. The absence of an obvious destination further complicates the task. De Mistura has suggested up to 10,000 fighters sympathetic to HTS operate in Idlib.Turkey is pleading with Russia to put the interests of millions of civilians ahead of a precipitous effort to drive out the militants, most of whom are integrated in the city. The so-called marbling effect, the blending of jihadists with civilians, has been a repeated problem in Syria.On Thursday, the 10 elected members of the UN security council issued a joint statement calling for restraint, but a debate on the issue at the security council on Friday is likely only to air differences rather than provide a solution.Olof Skoog, the UN permanent representative of Sweden, warned of a possible humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib.The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has set a strict red line on Russian operations in Idlib, saying on Tuesday that if the Syrian government wanted to “continue to the route of taking over Syria, they can do that but they cannot do it with chemical weapons”.Russia has built up its fleet in the Mediterranean to counter any possible US assault on the Syrian army."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9f81f1e05e00d43fd0caf90f7ae8423d9289734/0_194_5514_3307/master/5514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ee619201c595126ccc4e4f66b286625","title":"north korea turns 70 all eyes on missile displays at biggest parade of the year","story":"On Sunday the regime will hold a huge ceremony, but might hold off on the ICBMs to avoid angering the USNorth Korea is set to hold a massive military parade on Sunday to mark the 70th anniversary of the country’s founding, a powerful display of martial might as talks with the US over the country’s nuclear weapons program stall.The parade will coincide with visits from foreign dignitaries and a large-scale choreographed performance known as the Mass Games, held for the first time in five years. The display of military hardware and phalanxes of goosestepping soldiers is likely to be larger than another parade held earlier this year, though more subdued compared with last year, according to analysis.Whether large intercontinental ballistic missiles are included in the parade will be key. They could be seen as a provocative move. North Korea has suspended nuclear and missile tests as talks continue with US officials.Satellite images did not show vehicles used for carrying ICBMs in the parade staging area, but “they could still be onsite but housed in the heavy equipment shelters”, according to monitoring group 38 North. It will “likely be considerably larger than the military parade earlier this year,” 38 North analyst Joseph Bermudez wrote.Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said: “If it does display ICBMs, it would be wise for the United States to take it in stride as another North Korean propaganda spectacle and not as something that should materially affect negotiations.”Oba added: “North Korea has been consistent in signalling that it is strong, able to defend itself, and that its status as a nuclear power is a done deal. I imagine those are the biggest themes we\u0027ll see here.“I would be surprised if North Korea did anything in this parade to compromise negotiations or President Trump took something in the parade as a reason not to continue engaging North Korea.”The last parade held in February saw 13,000 soldiers participate as about 50,000 people gathered in Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung square to watch, according to the South’s Yonhap news agency. North Korea showcased its Hwasong-15 long-range ICBM, theoretically capable of striking most of the US mainland with a range of 13,000km (8,000 miles).Vipin Narang, a politics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that for Sunday’s procession “the most provocative move would be for Kim to parade new nuclear capable systems that we have not seen before”.“The signal in this case would be: ‘not only did I say I’m not unilaterally disarming, but I’ve even got some new toys in the works.’”But he added it was unlikely Kim would want to be so aggressive while their talks with the US continue.China will send Li Zhanshu, chairman of the National People’s Congress and senior advisor to president Xi Jinping, to attend the parade, after rumours that Xi himself would travel to Pyongyang in what would be his first official trip to North Korea.The warm atmosphere of Donald Trump’s meeting with Kim in June has largely faded, and there has been little progress on the goal of “complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula”. Trump cancelled a trip by secretary of state Mike Pompeo last month and the US could resume large-scale military exercises, halted as a good will gesture, next year if North Korea does not make progress on relinquishing its nuclear arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2f64495cdc32d570ec10ee813ac366bd0e7783b/231_270_3363_2018/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7aa86a1da399e3acc41c83ed236d1af0","title":"welcome to tourism vacation town china to build 12bn holiday hotspot in cambodia","story":"Vast project follows a similar $3.8bn project, raising concerns about Beijing’s dollar diplomacy in the region A $1.2bn Chinese-built “luxury city” is being built in Cambodia, accelerating what critics concerned about Beijing’s influence in the south-east Asian country call the region’s “Chinafication”.Chinese developer Tianjin Union Development Group (UDG) says Tourism Vacation Town will feature high-end hotels, offices and theme parks on 1,200 hectares of land in Cambodia’s southwestern Koh Kong province. Details are scant, but building work is expected to begin next year.The company has already started work on another $3.8bn resort in the same province, named\u0026nbspDara Sakor. In 2008 UDG was given a 99-year lease for land in Koh Kong to build Dara Sakor, which is expected to feature a port as well as attractions such as casinos. Many villagers have allegedly been displaced by the project, with some launching protests against what they said were unlawful “land grabs”.Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen sees Chinese investment as vital for his country’s development, and such issues have not deterred him from embracing Beijing. With Hun’s ties with the European Union and many western countries fraying following his\u0026nbspcontroversial election win in July, branded undemocratic by critics, he has welcomed both political and financial support from China.In 2017 China invested $1.7bn in Cambodia, with president Xi Jinping giving money to Hun’s military as well as encouraging Chinese businesses to invest in the country.

Since the last general election, support for its policies has surged on the back of unease over immigration. Sweden accepted more asylum seekers per head during the 2015 refugee crisis than any other EU country.It is not just Hörby. The Sweden Democrats hope to become the biggest party in 15 of the 33 municipalities in Skåne. “We’ve always had a historical tradition of being sceptical of anything which comes from Stockholm,” Borg said of Skåne and neighbouring Blekinge. “We are insubordinate.”At the Boijertz Conditori, a cafe looking over the square to the town’s jugendstil hotel, a woman selling cinnamon rolls summed up the party’s appeal. “It’s because there have been so many problems, a lot of gang fights, knives, drugs being sold openly on the streets,” she said. “It was a sweet little town. You didn’t have to be scared when you went out. And it’s not like that any more.”One of her customers, Hillevi Gustafson, retorted that this was more perception than reality, pointing to a police survey carried out in December. “It found that more people are feeling unsafe but that nobody had actually had anything happen to them personally,” she said.“It’s a war zone in Malmö,” Karin, one of three sisters at a neighbouring table, chipped in when she overheard us. “The last two years it’s exploded.”On Tuesday, yet another young man was shot dead in Malmö, bringing the yearly toll of fatal shootings in the city’s ongoing gang war to 11, or 3.2 per 100,000 people. The shootings have shocked Sweden, and are comparable to London, which has seen 91 murders so far this year, some of them shootings.Just as they have nationally, the Sweden Democrats here have exploited anxiety over crime. In May, Borg obtained a list of local shelters for asylum seekers and other vulnerable people.“We have 22 so-called HVB homes here where cities like Malmö and Lund put their problem cases,” he said. “It’s not just immigrants, but the majority are. And of course they come here with all the problems they’ve brought from wherever they come from. Drug abuse is very common.”Borg, who describes himself as a translator of Russian religious philosophy in the tradition of Dostoevsky, and his colleague Cecilia Bladh In Zito, a former executive at an Italian power company, exemplify the party’s shift away from the working class.“When I came back here after seven years abroad I was shocked,” In Zito said. “I was like: what has happened?” Even then, it took time for her to become active. “I believed what the TV and newspapers told me, that this was a racist party.”In 2012 a representative of the party in the town, Ronny Esbjörnsson, was caught railing on Facebook against blatte (immigrant) police officers, saying there should be schools exclusively for “ethnic Swedes” and declaring he would rather rent out a property to Hells Angels than Muslims.Susanne Meijer, the town’s Social Democrat mayor, accuses the party of still being racist today. She said she was proud that the town welcomed young asylum seekers, whom she described as “talented and smart kids who are studying and learning how to function in Swedish society”.But she seems to be struggling to convince voters that there’s no reason to be anxious.On the road out to the north, the council has erected another sign: “Hörby: here we live well and we feel good.”"},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb   July 21, 2018Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne finds have captured public\u0026rsquos imagination, and raise questions for the State   September 6, 2018Reports to National Monuments Service include prehistoric barrow cemetery, a henge, ringfort enclosures "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3621007.1536259861!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"consequences of no deal brexit go beyond what we can imagine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolish MEP Danuta Hubner chairs a European Parliament committee that must sign off on any Brexit treaty. Photograph: Carl GibneyDCUThere was an “openness” within the European Union to consider other ways of avoiding a hard border in Ireland to help secure a Brexit deal, an influential European MEP has said.Polish MEP Danuta Hubner, who chairs a European Parliament committee that must sign off on any Brexit treaty, said there had to be “openness” from the UK too to find an alternative solution to the issue. EU and UK negotiators are locked in a political stalemate over agreement on the so-called backstop that would guarantee an open border in Ireland in the event of no deal on future EU-UK trade. “If UK has a better proposal for the backstop, we are open to discuss these things. In a sense, there is openness. It just all depends on whether there is also an openness on the UK side,” she said.The British were offering no solution to maintain an open border in Ireland while London was still sticking with its “red lines” of leaving the EU single market and customs union, she said.Ms Hubner, on a visit to Ireland to speak at Dublin City University’s Brexit Institute, warned of the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal treaty being agreed.“We don’t have other options,” she said. “The consequences of no deal, I think, go beyond what we can imagine but we have to be prepared . . . it is a possibility or a likelihood.” The Polish politician told the institute in her presentation that people were “extremely pessimistic” in Europe abut the Brexit negotiations, putting the chances of a deal between the EU and UK at 50:50.She suggested that the UK should seek a Norway-type deal to join the European Economic Area and remain in the single market as Europe could not afford another “very specific, bespoke solution”.“If the Brits were smart, then they should join the EEA and then look for changes later on,” she said.The chair of the European Parliament’s constitutional affairs committee said that Brexit negotiations could slip past a key EU summit in October but November was the final deadline for a deal if EU lawmakers were to ratify it in time for the UK’s departure from the union in March.“It might slip to November and we can still do it on time if we have it in November. Any further delay would really bring a threat of no deal,” she told The  before her address to the institute.Ms Hubner said that the deep isions British prime minister Theresa May was struggling with in her own party on Brexit were “certainly not helpful”.“Whatever she is proposing, she sees two unhappy halves of her government because for some it is not enough for others, it is too much,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Like the doctors who put General Francisco Franco through needless torment for weeks before his death in November 1975, Theresa May’s ministers will stop at nothing to keep her Chequers plan for Brexit alive.\u0026nbspThe Spanish doctors were terrified that the dictator would reap his fiery reward before his courtiers had every detail in place for an orderly succession. For weeks TV news bulletins around the world reported nightly that Franco was not yet dead, inspiring Saturday Night Live’s regular update later confirming that he was still dead.Throughout the summer Conservative Brexiteers have been telling the prime minister that Chequers is as dead as Franco, a diagnosis confirmed this week by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.“Les propositions sont mortes,” he told a group of MPs this week, according to Labour’s Stephen Kinnock.The prime minister and her allies insist that Chequers remains a negotiable proposal, pointing out that the EU has not rejected it. It is true that although Barnier has rubbished two of its central elements – single market access for goods and a complicated, dual-tariff customs arrangement – the EU has not yet issued the death certificate. May is confident that, when EU leaders meet in Salzburg, Austria, on September 20th, they will continue to be polite about her proposal even if they restate their commitment to the principles that make it unacceptable.The Brexiteers, who flirted for a while with a no-deal Brexit (even attempting to rebrand it as “WTO rules”), have for the most part woken up to the fact that leaving the EU next March without a transition period would be catastrophic.This shift has been driven partly by the return to the back benches of Steve Baker, long an organising force behind the Brexiteers who as Brexit minister was responsible for no-deal planning. It has been encouraged by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been “trying to keep the crazies in line”, according to one source.Rees-Mogg was among the MPs who met Barnier in Brussels this week, and he claimed afterwards that they agreed that the best option consistent with Britain’s red lines was a Canada-style free trade agreement. When Brexit secretary Dominic Raab appeared before the EU scrutiny committee on Wednesday, a number of Brexiteers asked him why the government didn’t abandon Chequers in favour of Canada.One argument Raab made against Canada was that it would not solve the issue of the Border, and would consign Northern Ireland to an indefinite limbo under the terms of a backstop.Richard Drax, a former officer in the Coldstream Guards who represents South Dorset, told Raab that the issue of Northern Ireland had been blown out of all proportion.“Having served out there on three tours, I can tell you that if the Irish Government started to put up some sort of restrictions on the Border there would be an outcry, not just from the North but also from the South. It just wouldn’t happen,” he said.Drax, whose full name is the quadruple-barrelled\u0026nbspRichard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, is the great-nephew of the Irish writer Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany, who was part of the Irish literary revival in the early 20th century. Dunsany achieved worldwide success with stories and plays set in a fantasy world, and Drax may be engaging in magical thinking when he suggests that the issue of the Border can be ignored.Britain has rejected the EU’s draft protocol on the backstop but its negotiators have shown no sign that they are ready to propose an alternative text.Barnier, however, has sought to “de-dramatise” the issue, stressing that the EU is simply seeking to build on existing checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for animal and plant hygiene, for example. To this end he has asked Britain for details of how such checks are conducted today.He has also indicated that the EU is willing to change the language of the protocol, which currently includes two phrases that are particularly toxic for unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea. The first refers to the creation of a “common regulatory area” on the island of Ireland, and the second states that “the territory of Northern Ireland...shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union”.The joint report agreed between Britain and the EU last December called only for full alignment “with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement”.In recent weeks Barnier has referred to a limited number of EU rules continuing to apply to Northern Ireland, a shift that could reassure unionists that the backstop does not undermine the UK’s constitutional order.\u0026nbspRegulatory checks could be conducted at British ports only and not in Northern Ireland because the EU is only concerned with goods travelling from east to west. Northern Ireland’s traders would continue to have frictionless access to the rest of the UK as well as to the rest of the island of Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

So, the parties fight for election within their own community.“Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.”Theresa May appointed Ms Bradley to the post in January – succeeding James Brokenshire – at an exceptionally sensitive time because of Brexit and the breakdown in Stormont’s power-sharing government.Ms Bradley’s admission prompted astonishment that she had risen so far in the Conservative party and government without knowing that Northern Ireland voters split along constitutional lines.Theresa May sent the former culture secretary to Belfast supposedly as a safe pair of hands. Ms Bradley (47) said Northern Ireland politics had seemed alien to her.“That’s a very different world from the world I came from where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative. That is so incredibly different and it’s when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”The Troubles had shaped her view of Northern Ireland, she said. “I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today.”House magazine quoted Jenny Chapman, the shadow Brexit minister, calling the admissions embarrassing. “Given this worrying lack of basic knowledge about Northern Ireland, it’s no wonder the Tories don’t seem to understand the vital importance of preventing a return of a hard border there”. – "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

thought to be on a boat or barge - will cost £3 million to repair.It happened in March but the huge bill has only just been revealed after an investigation by the Canal and River Trust.A 70 metre stretch of the waterway in Middlewich, Cheshire, was washed away after the canal overflowed, leaving a 12m deep hole.Trees along the canal were torn from their rootsThe trust\u0027s probe has revealed that gates on the locks, which allow water into the canal, had been left open by a forgetful member of the public.They should have been closed after boats passed through the locks.The affected stretch had to be closed, meaning boats could not travel along that bit of the canal.Repairs are now underwayContractors have been toiling since March to install dams either side of the breach, removing dangerous trees and rescuing stranded boats.About 15 boats were stranded and more than 10,000 fish were rescued, but many more died when they were washed on to dry land.The trust hopes the canal, which runs through Whitchurch and Ellesmere, will re-open to boats by Christmas.Canals and waterwaysPlease review our commenting policyCalifornia wildfire devastates 34 square miles of landShooting the Bodyguard: the secrets of the hit show\u0026#39s filming locationsBritish Airways hacking: Customers cancel credit cards as airline defends handling of \u0026#39sophisticated\u0026#39 cyber attackBritish Airways hack: How to find out if your data was stolen and steps to stay secureBoris Johnson and Marina Wheeler to orce after 25 years of marriageInternational Criminal Court rules it can investigate alleged crimes against the Rohingya in Burma\u0026#39Lots of evidence\u0026#39 Syria is preparing to use chemical weapons in Idlib, says US envoy ahead of Tehran meetingLabour\u0026#39s leading pro-Israel MP loses vote of no confidence as latest purge is broadcast by banned Iranian TV stationIdlib offensive: Why the looming fight for Syria\u0026#39s last rebel stronghold could be the bloodiest yetDuke and Duchess of Sussex support military mental health at gala marking 100 days to the end of WW1British tourists flying to Dubai warned about drinking alcohol on flightsNorthern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley admits she didn\u0026#39t understand region\u0026#39s politicsBritain\u0026#39s Brexit trade deal with Beijing put at risk by South China Sea \u0026#39provocation\u0026#39, state media warnsHedgehogs disappear from British countryside as badgers are devouring themBodyguard\u0026#39s Richard Madden: being known as a \u0026#39hunky thing\u0026#39 undermines my acting GPs should prescribe gardening, dancing and cookery, Matt Hancock saysSmacking ban legislation tabled at Holyrood allowing prosecution of parentsJet hand dryers \u0026#39aerosolise\u0026#39 E. coli and other harmful bugs, scientists warnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/02/15/chicken-farm.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/02/15/chicken-farm.jpg","title":"brexit no deal uk likely northern ireland border eu latest updates","story":"Created with Sketch.EU has asked for a plan and said there can be no deal without a workable fixClick to followThe IndependentBrexit: No-deal grows more likely as UK refuses to table new plan for Northern Ireland border backstopThe UK is refusing to table a new plan for a Northern Ireland border backstop in Brexit talks – raising the prospect of disastrous no-deal as the negotiating deadline looms.Frustrated EU officials are complaining that the UK is even making it harder for them to come up with their own new plan to break the deadlock, by dragging its feet on releasing data relating to existing checks on the border.The Northern Ireland backstop is the biggest issue preventing withdrawal agreement from being signed – a state of affairs that would see the UK crash out of the block potentially causing chaos.\u0026nbspBrussels and Ireland have both said they would not accept a withdrawal agreement without a backstop\u0026nbspin it to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland under any circumstances.Theresa May flat-out rejected the EU proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory months ago, warning that “no British prime minister” could agree to it – but there has since been little progress on coming up with an alternative.British officials in Brussels confirmed to The Independent again on Thursday that there were no immediate plans to publish a new white paper or other plan for a backstop, despite the EU request for a new proposal.The British position is to\u0026nbspoffer a “temporary customs arrangement” from early June coupled with the Chequers proposals – meaning there is no need for a backstop. But EU has said this plan would not prevent a hard border and that other proposals are needed.Michel Barnier urges Theresa May to reconsider Irish border planTheresa May\u0027s Brexit plan \u0027would lead to hard border\u0027 with IrelandEU Brexit chief says NI backstop cannot apply to whole UKBritish officials say they want to prevent a hard border by negotiating a future relationship that removes the need for checks – but the prime minister’s Chequers plan has been all-but rejected by the European Commission.For months there have been reports around Brussels that the commission is working on tweaking its own backstop proposal to “de-dramatise” it and make it more palatable to the UK, but new plans have yet to materialise.The British government sees keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union as a thread to British sovereignty, and the Democratic Unionist Party which props up Theresa May’s minority government has said it will not accept different treatment for Northern Ireland.But Brussels officials familiar with negotiations say that the commission’s plans to come up with an alternative backstop have been slow because the UK has not yet provided data about checks which already take place on the border, which the commission believes might help it come up with a new proposal.\u0026nbspBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

However this only occurs in the bowel so would be unlikely to affect the lungs or airways except in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, where the digestive system is also involved, Dr Balfour-Lynn said.It is more likely the phenomenon is so persistent because of the way milk feels.“This could well affect the sensory perception of milk mixed with saliva, both in terms of its thickness coating the mouth and the after feel–when small amounts of emulsion remain in the mouth after swallowing,” he writes.“This may explain why so many people think there is more mucus produced, when, in fact, it is the aggregates of milk emulsion that they are aware of lingering in the mouth after swallowing.”Dr Balfour-Lynn adds that that fractures are more common in children who don’t drink milk, and there could actually be health risks.This is particularly important in conditions like cystic fibrosis or asthma when sometimes repeated large doses of steroids, which sap bone strength, are part of the treatment.“While certainly the texture of milk can make some people feel their mucus and saliva is thicker and harder to swallow, there is no evidence (and indeed evidence to the contrary) that milk leads to excessive mucus secretion,” he concludes. “The milk-mucus myth needs to be rebutted firmly by healthcare workers.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/06/10/rts1x5zl.jpg","title":"indian rupee dollar exchange rate all time low investors emerging markets","story":"Created with Sketch.The prospect of US interest rate hikes and global trade tensions are hurting emerging marketsClick to followThe IndependentThe Indian currency was rocked last month by the Turkish crisisThe Indian rupee has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar, in a tough week for emerging market currencies amid investor concerns about a potential trade war.

Some even faced bills for changing their blinds (£527) and installing a new front door (£411).While the freehold on a block of flats is commonly owned separately, with each unit being leasehold, the practice is increasingly being used by developers selling houses, where purchasers may not be alert to the fact they face extra charges.More than three-quarters (78 per cent) of leasehold house owners surveyed had bought their home directly from developers and 57 per cent did not realise what being a leaseholder meant until they had bought the property.Almost two thirds used the solicitor recommended by the developer and 15 per cent said they were never told that they wouldn’t own the freehold.Leaseholders are currently paying an average of £319 a year for ground rent, with most having been in their properties for three or four years, the report found.A third of those surveyed who were trying to sell the said they were struggling to find a buyer because they do not own the freehold and a quarter said house hunters who were interested were put off when they found out it was a leasehold home.Mark Hayward, chief executive at NAEA Propertymark said: “Most buyers have no idea about the trappings of a leasehold contract until it\u0027s too late.”Government bans leaseholds on newbuild housesGovernment unveils plan to ban sale of \u0027unjust\u0027 leasehold housesLeasehold homeowners are ‘overpaying to extend’ leasesCalls for change to new homes leasehold nightmareBuying a leasehold property is not as easy as a freeholdIn July, communities secretary James Brokenshire, announcing housing measures for England, said it was not fair that homeowners were facing unexpected costs that rise every year and bear no relation to services.“So from now on any new Government funding scheme will contain the condition that the money cannot support the unjustified use of leasehold for new homes,” he said.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “It\u0027s unacceptable for home buyers to be exploited through unfair and abusive practices within the leasehold system, and the findings in the Propertymark report underline our position that real action is needed.“This is why we have already announced measures that include a ban on leaseholds for almost all new-build houses and restricting ground rents to a peppercorn.“We are also working with the Law Commission to support existing leaseholders to make buying a freehold or extending a lease faster, fairer and cheaper.”A spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation (HBF) said it was sometimes necessary to sell new houses with leases.“This includes where the developer itself does not own the freehold. Leases for houses, like flats, commonly include proportionate ground rents that do not impinge on the mortgageability or saleability of a property and, as such, leasehold is a well-established and secure tenure with which to own a home.“In all transactions, builders strive to provide prospective purchasers, their solicitors and their mortgage lenders with all relevant information.“Purchasers are always advised to engage their own legal advice during the purchase of a home.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia.

They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesFormer Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown speaks during the \u0027Jewish Labour Movement Conference\u0027 An inflatable caricature balloon of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan floats, near Parliament Square in London.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/17/hawa-son1.jpg  width= 750  height= 586  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/17/hawa-son1.jpg","title":"mohamed bangoura british boy refused entry uk emergency passport latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Home Office bows to pressure after six-year-old\u0027s plight revealed by The IndependentClick to followThe Independent Sajid Javid opposes \u0027hostile environment\u0027 approach to UK immigration opting instead for a \u0027compliant environment\u0027British-born boy refused entry to UK on return from summer holidays granted emergency passportA British-born boy who was blocked from returning to the UK\u0026nbspafter a holiday\u0026nbsphas been granted an emergency passport after being stranded in Brussels for four days.Six-year-old Mohamed\u0026nbspBangoura\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspunable to reunite with\u0026nbsphis mother\u0026nbspafter he was\u0026nbspprevented from boarding a flight from\u0026nbspZaventem\u0026nbspairport to Manchester under Home Office orders on Sunday.After The Independent revealed his plight on Tuesday, a number of politicians wrote to the department demanding to know why the child had\u0026nbspnot yet been flown home four days later.British boy refused entry to UK on return from holidayMother of British boy refused entry to UK says she is ‘dead inside’ Passports for UK-born children of EU nationals rejected ‘in error’Following\u0026nbspintervention by the child’s MP, Labour’s Paul Blomfield,\u0026nbspon Thursday, immigration\u0026nbspminister Caroline Nokes\u0026nbspsaid she would authorise\u0026nbspthe issue of emergency travel documents.​The Home\u0026nbspOffice said it\u0026nbspwould be in contact with the family in the next 24 hours to make arrangements for reuniting the mother and son.\u0026nbspThe Foreign Office is\u0026nbspspeaking to his family in Belgium to assist with the arrangements there.Hawa\u0026nbspKeita, Mohamed’s mother, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspshe was thrilled at the news that she would finally be reunited with her son.Hawa\u0026nbspKeita)“I am so happy.

The fact of knowing that I will see my son again gives me the joy of living.I\u0026nbsphope that no mother will have to\u0026nbsplive through\u0026nbspthis kind of situation.Critics\u0026nbspbranded the case “truly shocking” and said the act of blocking a UK-born child from returning home was “shameful” and “exactly one of the effects” of the government’s hostile environment policy.Immigration lawyers meanwhile said the case highlighted a problem within UK nationality law: namely that being born in the UK does not automatically make a child British, and that a child’s father is defined as the husband of the mother at the time of birth.After being blocked from boarding his flight, Mohamed had to stay with family friends\u0026nbspin Brussels. His mother was unable to travel to see him\u0026nbspbecause she doesn’t currently hold a passport.Ms Keita, who is of Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, said the situation had made her feel\u0026nbsp“dead inside”.\u0026nbspShe denied Home Office claims that she received a letter in March stating her son’s passport had been revoked.The Home Office letter, which Ms Keita said she received for the first time by\u0026nbspemail on Sunday, states that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man she was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain.But Ms Keita said that this man was her Guinea-based ex-husband whom she was in the process of orcing. She explained that she had moved to the UK and was living with another partner a British man and the father of Mohamed.Speaking three days after her son was prevented from returning home, she said: “When my friend told me what had happened from the airport, I\u0026nbspcouldn’t believe it. I was very... dead inside. I can’t explain the feeling. It was very difficult.\u0026nbspMEPs (Hawa Keita)I never received a letter.

But counter-intuitively, the UK is arguing that this would not be the case.UK officials familiar with the British negotiating position say there is already huge flexibility within the EU on service regulations and that the UK will not get an unfair advantage compared to European firms.\u0026nbspThis is an admission of what those of us who are against Chequers already know – it’s a bad deal for the UK.They are also arguing that because UK businesses selling services into the EU will have to follow the regulations of that country anyway there would be no way to undercut European businesses trading there.\u0026nbspOfficials have also admitted that where services are covered by single market rules, firms actually tend to gain an advantage from being part of those rules because it allows them to sell into other countries – meaning the UK might actually lose out from not being in the single market.Remainers and Brexiteers alike said the news showed Chequers would be a failure – though they suggested different resolutions.Eurosceptic Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “This is an admission of what those of us who are against Chequers already know – it’s a bad deal for the UK.“It shackles us to the EU as a captive market, a vassal state.“It serves a key purpose for the EU – other countries will look at this and say well if the UK, with the size of its economy, can’t get any sort of advantage from leaving the EU then no one can.”Labour MP Owen Smith, a supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “If the Chequers Deal offers no advantages for Britain, what on Earth is the point of pursuing it?\u0026nbsp“This is just the latest revelation that even those negotiating the Brexit deal know that a soft Brexit offers no upsides, while a hard Brexit is a pure disaster.”Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab travelled to Brussels on Thursday to meet with his counterpart Mr Barnier, though the pair made no public appearances or statements.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU. I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission. Europe needs a new beginning and more democracy.”AFPGetty)In recent months Mr Weber has taken a tough rhetorical line on immigration and migration, in an apparent bid to position himself for the role. In January he was forced to apologise for a comment in which he called for a “final solution to the refugee question”.

Recently we saw 20 factories shut down over night, due to poor practices.“Crashing out of the EU without a deal, means we would lose much of the EU external infrastructure that allows us to monitor and inspect the food we eat and how it is prepared.”Meanwhile, the “disruption” from a no-deal Brexit would force farmers to pass on significantly higher production costs to shoppers, the report warned.“Lower-income consumers may be left unable to afford fresh British chicken, instead having to rely on cheaper, lower standard meat imports from countries outside the EU,” it said.“This could create a two-tier food system, where only the wealthy can afford to eat fresh home-reared chicken.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union It comes after Dominic Raab admitted in July the government must ensure there is adequate food supply in the event Britain and the EU fail to agree a deal.\u0026nbspThe Brexit secretary confirmed the\u0026nbspgovernment was making extraordinary plans to stockpile food in case the negotiations fail.\u0026nbspHe told MPs the task would be overseen by industry, rather than Whitehall.\u0026nbspThe government’s own figures show that 30 per cent of food imports came from the EU in 2016.\u0026nbspThe next highest figure is 5 per cent – from Africa – with 49 per cent produced domestically, in the UK.The ResPublica report pointed out that, although the UK is the fourth-largest poultry meat producer in the EU, being 60 per cent self-sufficient, that statistic hid the looming problem.British meat-eaters prefer chicken breasts, which meant UK producers sought to export the 75 per cent of the bird that is left over, including dark cuts like wings, legs and thighs.“Approximately 70 per cent of our dark meat exports are to the EU and the majority of the poultry meat that is imported into the UK comes from the European Union,” it said.The warning over meat prices came\u0026nbspthe same day the health secretary admitted taxpayers will have to foot the bill for stockpiling NHS medicines in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspMatt Hancock revealed he was “talking to the pharmaceutical industry about what extra costs the government should cover” for the task of building up supplies.He also said he was planning to “switch supply from land to air” for short-life medicines – although that would appear to depend on a scrambled aviation agreement with the EU.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6406121  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg","title":"operation yellowhammer brexit photo eu rail access nodeal secret paper latest document","story":"Created with Sketch.Government departments will have to make cuts to prepare for crashing out of the EU -

You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it’s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?“This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back?

I’m kind of hoping they’re not right.”Lord Blunkett, a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair’s administration, said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.Asked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer said: “It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn’t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.”antisemitism seriouslyBut Mr Blair’s intervention sparked a backlash from Mr Corbyn’s supporters, with Chris Williamson MP saying he did not understand Mr Blair’s argument, given the huge support Mr Corbyn enjoyed in the party membership.He said: “The Labour Party has never been more united.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/06/21/gettyimages-630428306.jpg","title":"philadelphia airport passengers sick emirates flight jfk france germany flu","story":"Created with Sketch.The scare comes just a day after passengers reported similar symptoms at a New York airportClick to followThe Independent USAt least 12 passgengers on an two American Airlines flights arriving from Germany and France in Philadelphia International Airport have reported flu-like symptoms Several sick passengers at the Philadelphia airport prompted the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to hold 250 people for medical examination.

The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/03/15/ap-18246372421934.jpg","title":"netanyahu duterte israel philippines visit obama","story":"Created with Sketch.The Philippine president, who likened his country\u0027s war on drugs to the Holocaust,\u0026nbspeyes arms deal with Israel during a\u0026nbspfour-day tour\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Jerusalem on MondayBenjamin Netanyahu has warmly welcomed\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcontroversial Philippine president, who once\u0026nbspcompared himself to Hitler, adding to mounting criticism of the Israeli prime minister’s close ties with authoritarian world leaders.Rodrigo Duterte, who is in Israel for a four-day tour, is the first Philippine leader to visit the country since the two nations established diplomatic relations 60 years ago. \u0026nbspThe firebrand president is expected to sign a major oil deal with Israel and to purchase Israeli arms, during the short tour in which he has been accompanied by an entourage of security forces.\u0026nbspMr Duterte has faced widespread criticism for his deadly crackdown on drugs back home which has left thousands dead and for several foul-mouthed comments, including comparing his war on drugs to the Holocaust, and most recently\u0026nbspjoking about rape.Despite the many controversies, on Monday Mr Netanyahu highlighted the two country’s historical\u0026nbspfriendship, including the Philippines’\u0026nbspdecision to vote in favour of Israel’s establishment in 1947, becoming the only Asian country to do so.“We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years,” Mr Netanyahu said, after signing three agreements on trade, science and care-giving.Mr Duterte, who later visited the country’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and met top officials including President Reuven Rivlin, said they “share the same passion for peace”.“Israel can expect any help that the Philippines can extend,” he added.We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years\u0026nbspThe Philippines has enjoyed\u0026nbspincreasingly strong ties with Israel over the years. In December it abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly rebuking the US for moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Washington’s controversial decision recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite the fact it is contested city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Philippine president is also seeking new sources of military hardware and emerged as a significant new customer in 2017 for Israel, with sales of radar and anti-tank equipment worth $21m.Mr Netanyahu has been praised for forging ties with new allies abroad, where Israel has often lost support for its occupation of the Palestinian territories.However, in recent months the Israeli leader has come under fire for the choice of those partners.Why Netanyahu sees Poland as Israel’s most important ally in EuropeIsrael’s Netanyahu criticised for wooing Hungary’s far-right PMWhy has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?Benjamin Netanyahu questioned by police in corruption investigation Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Europe to lobby May on Iran dealMr Duterte’s visit comes just weeks after Netanyahu welcomed Viktor Orban, Hungary’s four-time prime minister who was criticised last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s World War II-era ruler and a Nazi collaborator.Mr Orban was also accused of employing anti-Semitic tropes against George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, during his re-election campaign. During Mr Orban’s visit to Israel in July, Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu praised him for combatting anti-semitism.Mr Netanyahu was also criticised for striking a deal with Polish President Andrzej Duda over his country’s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalised blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.Mr\u0026nbspDuterte, who assumed power 2016, did little to assuage fears on Sunday when he kicked off his four-day tour of Israel with a rambling expletive-ladened speech to members of the Filipino community in Jerusalem.During the hour-long talk he justified comments made on Thursday that the high rape rate in a Philippine city was due to the number of “beautiful women”. And he apologised for calling former US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore”.Duterte defended by spokespersonIn 2016, Mr Duterte drew worldwide anger when he said he would kill as many drug addicts as Hitler did Jews, adding “I’d be happy to slaughter them”. \u0026nbspIn the same speech he had also claimed three million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, half the number agreed by historians. The president later apologised, saying he had been misunderstood.But his comments were not forgotten in Israel. Left-leaning daily Haaretz\u0026nbspon Monday published an editorial headlined “A Hitler admirer at Yad Vashem,” while The Times of Israel asked why Israel was “opening its doors” to Mr Duterte in a piece entitled “this man has no place in our country”. Left-wing politicians, meanwhile, questioned why Mr Netanyahu wanted to “whitewash an illegitimate leader”.He “took pride in massacring his citizens and violating human rights… so why?” Tamar Zandberg, head of the leftist Meretz party, wrote on Facebook.“Because Duterte is willing to support the occupation (of the West Bank),” she said.The most controversial quotes from Rodrigo Duterte“These sons of whores are destroying our children.

Christianity CRACKDOWN: Violent mob ransacks and loots home church\u0026ldquoThe photography team in Bursa City Hall have been capturing the aerial photos of the Lake since 2013, but hadn\u0026rsquot thought of contacting any expert, said Dr Şahin.\u0026ldquoSo when they started capturing aerial pictures of the lake again, team member Saffet Yilmaz contacted me and asked if the remains of the structure might have meant something.\u0026ldquoWhen I first saw the images of the lake, I was quite surprised to see a church structure that clearly.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod been doing field surveys in Iznik since 2006 and hadn\u0026rsquot yet discovered a magnificent structure like that.Lake Iznik is where the church was discovered (Image: PENNEWS)The church was found thanks to some aerial photos (Image: PENNEWS)Dr Şahin believes the church marks the place where Saint Neophytos was martyred in 303AD and that it was built in his honour.It may also mark the site of the former Senate Palace where the first First Council of Nicaea took place nearly 1700 years ago.There is even evidence of an earlier temple there dedicated to Apollo, a Greek and Roman god sometimes associated with Jesus in the early Christian period.The church itself was destroyed by an earthquake in 740 AD and later sank beneath the lake.\u0026ldquoThe ruins remain two to three metres deep in the lake and 50 metres from the shore, said Dr Şahin.\u0026ldquoThe hardest part of the underwater excavation is that visibility sometimes drops under 10cm because of intense algae and plankton activity.\u0026ldquoAnother special difficulty is slime being spreading throughout the water from the top of the lake\u0026rsquos base during the excavation.\u0026ldquoHaving the remains on a shallow surface also means the waves hitting archaeologists during their work, which affects work negatively.Lake Iznik is in Turkey (Image: PEN NEWS)To surmount the problems, the team takes soil from the site to the shore, and sifts through it there.Now Mustafa, who is head of archaeology at Bursa Uludağ University, wants the site to become Turkey\u0026rsquos first underwater museum.\u0026ldquoIt is suitable to become an underwater museum for three reasons, he said.\u0026ldquoIt might be the basilica of Saint Neophytos, the Senate Palace where the First Council of Nicaea met might have been there, and lastly the Temple of Apollo might be underneath.The museum would include a 20-metre tower to allow the ruins to be seen from the shore, a walkway over the lake itself, and a submerged glass room at the nave where visitors can pray.There would also be a ing club, allowing visitors to see the structure up close.Construction could begin as early as this year, ready to open in 2019.\u0026ldquoThere is actually no need to wait for the end of excavation to built a museum, said Mustafa.\u0026ldquoWith our excavation methodology, the visitors aren\u0026rsquot a distraction for the work in progress.As well as agreeing the nature of the relationship between God and Jesus, the First Council of Nicaea set a date for Easter, and created the Nicene Creed, which is still used in Catholic Mass.It was held to decide whether Jesus had been \u0027begotten\u0027 by God from his own being, and therefore had no beginning, or was created out of nothing, and therefore had a beginning.The council decided overwhelmingly in favour of the former.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today. My winnings, £60 in today’s money, allegedly went to a charity. I never saw any evidence of that either.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When Jacob Rees-Mogg met Michel Barnier yesterday, both reportedly agreed it was a dud.Its chances of approval anywhere look negligible. If Mrs May softens it further for the EU she’s toast. If she hardens it for Brexiteers, it’s even less likely to fly.Whatever Downing Street says, it’s not a plan if it has no possibility of proceeding. And if it’s a non-starter, isn’t it time to accept it and focus on a more basic free trade deal? Even if it means a small amount of disruption at the Irish border?There’s no guarantee that will get through the Commons either. But it would fulfil the wishes of Leave voters and Brexit-backing MPs — and is far more likely to get the nod in Brussels.Brexit is just six months away. It would be insane to waste time on a proposal with apparently zero chance of success.WE have had some harsh words for Bank of England boss Mark Carney.He was ceaselessly gloomy about Brexit and often appeared to act as spokesman for George Osborne’s Project Fear brigade.But we never doubted his skills.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required. Some publishers, it seems, have more freedom than others.Facebook’s two-faced bosses should be brought to book for their double standards on privacy and their blatant disregard for the public good.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party? Or are you just waiting for someone to come and rescue you?You’ve got a long wait. You have to do it yourselves.I WAS feeling a bit sorry for Roxanne Pallett.She made a mistake, only a kid really – and now she’s lost everything.And then I saw an interview with her.Dense as a slab of tungsten – although I suppose that’s not her fault.I mean, if you were born with only a five-watt bulb flickering away inside your skull it’s not something that can be changed very easily, is it?But more than that, it was her absolute self-absorption.Everything was about me, me, me.Not the hurt she had caused to others, but the misery she’d inflicted on HERSELF.It’s a common condition these days, I suppose.But Pallett is a pretty extreme example.SEEN what’s been happening in Germany?Huge demonstrations against immigration in Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx Stadt.The BBC and others say it’s all the “far right”. Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed? Men won’t want to give one to someone who is totally toothless.

But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls.

So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves. A Tasmanian devil, say, or a king cobra.WHY has Jose Mourinho not been sacked by Manchester United?I don’t mean because his team are not terribly good. Or about as pleasing to watch as John Prescott eating a curry.But he’s just been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and hit with whopping fines – for tax evasion running into the millions of pounds.Does Manchester United not have any principles?I’LL be glued to the box watching The Mighty Redcar on BBC2 tonight. Seeing that the town is only a stone’s throw from my gaff in Saltburn.I was worried at first that it was just another poverty-porn film.You know, when the BBC turns up somewhere north of Watford so everyone can have a good old snigger at the people who live there.But having spoken to some of the people who took part, it isn’t like that at all.Redcar’s had it rough and wages are low. Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Krasue fears sharp objects, because they can destroy the organs hanging from the neck.Fearful villagers will often hunt for the body of the Krasue at night, hoping to destroy it, and therefore kill the demon.The Krasue led many Thais to compulsively collect their laundry before nightfall.Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Malaysia have similar legends. These black creatures lurk in the shadows of homes, under carpets or within wardrobes.They have long, lean arms, wrinkly fingers and red eyes.A misbehaving child may be warned: The Baubas will come and get you.The creature is thought to tare out victims hairs or suffocate them.Some believe the demon resembles a man in a black coat who wears a heavy hood to obscure his face, and carries a large sack in which he carries naughty children away.A popular lullaby says that he would keep a child with him for a whole year, not harming the child, just frightening him constantly.Some parents will even tap the underside of a table if the child refuses to eat, claiming the sack man is coming. This lanky spectre is proof that folklore doesnt have to mean ancient, and may be among the first pieces of digital folklore.The supernatural humanoid, with no discernible facial features, unnervingly long arms and always dressed in an impeccable suit, is a modern creation of the internet.He first appeared in 2009 after a competition to create paranormal images, and from there the legend of this child-snatching spectre grew into many online stories, games, and even a recent film.Slender Mans legend grew rapidly, in part due to the literature being linked to several violent crimes, including the near-fatal stabbing of a twelve-year-old girl in Wisconsin.The two culprits - classmates of the victim - claimed they wanted to commit murder as the first step towards becoming proxies for Slender Man.They said they feared the spectre would murder their families if they didnt kill.Slender man was also implicated as a driving force for a spate of suicide attempted by young people in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in South Dakota.These dwarf-sized creatures are believed to be summoned by the evil to make trouble for others.They are said to snare children, and murder their victims while they sleep.Many in South Africa keep their beds raised on bricks for fear of the demons stealing their breath, or even their soul.The legend apparently stems from the many deaths of healthy people at night, as they sheltered in primitive shelters.Today, it is reasoned that fires used to keep warm at night actually depleted oxygen, and caused the deaths.But in the early years, when it was noticed those who slept higher up survived, the deaths were blamed on the Tikoloshe. This Buddhist legend is known as the hungry ghost.The name translates as the departed, and these cursed souls are believed to be invisible to the human eye. If we could see them, they would appear mummified, with narrow limbs and enormous distended bellies.They are effectively the greatest victims of karma, and are believed to have been corrupt, deceitful and jealous people in previous lives, and reincarnated with insatiable hunger and thirst.Often they are obsessed with possessing a certain substance or object.They can be a simple nuisance, but can turn dangerous, if they turn their hunger to blood.Many Buddhists pity the Preta however, and will even leave small offerings for them. No one likes a ghost visiting when youre indisposed, but thats exactly where the Phi Kee haunts.Far from being a vicious spectre however, the Phi Kee is a ghoul to consult with before you go to the bathroom.Doing so, Thais believe, will see your bad luck removed along with your excrement.This helpful ghoul can be handy in a country where food hygiene isnt quite up to western standards. These women of the fairy mound are believed to herald the death of family members, usually with characteristic wailing and shrieking.They can appear as beautiful virgins who died young and are now tasked with warning the family, or as withered old hangs dressed in grey cloaks, whose eyes are red from constant crying.Not necessarily evil, these keeners are sometimes believed to be deceased people with close ties to a family or community, who still wish to look over their old friends.In some parts it is said her wailing can be so piercing it shatters glass.In Scottish folklore, a similar creature is known as the bean nighe, or little washerwoman, and is known to be seen washing the bloodstained clothes or armour of those who are about to die. These troubled spirits rise from the grave, and drain victims of blood.The legend is thought to be the inspiration behind the vampire.The living strigoi, which roughly translates to the scream, are sorcerers that plague the countryside with disease and death.The dead strigoi are corpses that rise again from the grave in search of victims.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is an addiction that warrants medical treatment.“Everyone who smokes must be offered the support they need to quit.”He said the move would save thousands of lives and free up almost £900million a year — cash the NHS spends treating illnesses caused by tobacco.But critics blasted it as bullying. Simon Clark, of smokers’ lobby group Forest, said: “It’s laughable to think England will be smoke-free within 12 years.“Some people will always want to smoke.“It’s their choice and if you’re an adult you have every right to do so.“Some smokers would like to quit but many smoke because they enjoy it and no amount of state-sponsored bullying will force them to stop.”But Mr Selbie said the smoking crackdown must be part of a “ruthless” new NHS plan to boost health — including preventing heart disease and obesity.About 17 per cent of Brits smoke. That is expected to fall to 8½ per cent by 2030.But PHE wants to see it well below five per cent, if not zero.Mr Selbie said: “With the right long-term plan in place, we can remove smoking from England.

And guys are going in bottles.Whoever was on the ground, they overflowed.So when people started using the bathroom, it was so full anyways that it just shut up. And the water - everything goes in the same tank.The woman filming replied: Thats outrageous.

The stitch-up reeked.When MEPs found out, even the European parliament was appalled.The improper manoeuvre will keep Selmayr, a devout federalist, at the centre of power for years to come and long after his patron Jean-Claude Juncker has retired to spend more time with his wine cellar.How did they pull it off?The outgoing secretary-general had told Juncker, privately, he would retire this year.Armed with Juncker’s inside knowledge, Selmayr successfully applied to be deputy.Then, at a meeting of commissioners, Juncker revealed the secretary-general post was suddenly vacant and that, as luck would have it, Selmayr was ready to fill it.The ombudsman’s conclusions on what the pair did are scathing. Four serious breaches of protocol and maladministration are listed.Selmayr did not take appropriate measures to avoid conflict of interest. The rules of procedure were broken.“A situation of urgency to fill the post of secretary-general was created artificially,” O’Reilly says, and: “The commissioners  responsible for the maladministration in this case. It is extraordinary that no commissioner seemed to question the secretary-general appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Extraordinary is putting it mildly.The report makes for shocking, if not surprising, reading. The rules-based Brussels order and its highly paid apparat behave like a gangster racket.Just to be helpful, I’m going to send a copy of O’Reilly’s report to every EU flag-waving “People’s Vote” campaigner and to Gary Lineker, the crisp- toting TV football host, who has emerged as a leading voice in the campaign for a second referendum.Needless to say, Selmayr and Juncker face no sanctions or punishment.Instead, O’Reilly recommends that the commission should develop a new procedure — I’m sure that will help — for appointing the next secretary-general.My first thought on reading her report was that the commission is an even more appalling and arrogant organisation than it looks, sitting at the heart of an imperious EU wedded to ever-closer integration.Thank goodness we’re leaving. But are we?To listen to the hysterical wailing of the People’s Vote crowd in recent weeks, you would think that Brexit is about to be stopped and a grateful public will beg to be bossed around by Selmayr and his goons for years to come.There isn’t the parliamentary time for another referendum before we leave on March 29 and it’s an exceptionally duff idea regardless.If there can be two referendums, why leave it at that? Why not make it best of three or five? The decision to leave has been taken. Britain is quitting the EU.Thank goodness, in my view a shame, in the view of others — what matters now are the terms.Here, the Tory party is engaged in a row with itself over the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal, which envisages Britain sticking with the EU’s rule book on goods.It is astonishing to see how purist this has made some of my fellow-Brexiteers who spent years before the referendum acknowledging in private that there would have to be compromises.Not long ago, Boris Johnson was so torn by the nuanced arguments on either side that he plumped for Leave by the narrowest of margins. Now he plays the zealot.But contrary to the prophets of doom, the Chequers proposal isn’t dead yet.No10 is adamant that it has “unlocked the talks” and that, beneath the rhetoric of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, progress is being made that may become apparent at the Salzburg meeting of EU leaders on September 20.In a weird way it might work. With Theresa May’s internal critics split and producing almost as many alternative Brexit plans as there are Tory MPs, Labour divided, and other EU member states anxious that we don’t leave without a deal, something like the Chequers plan remains the best one on offer.It would satisfy non-obsessives like me to just agree a deal, improve it as we go along, and get on with life beyond Brexit. Life is full of compromises.This is sacrilege to my purist friends. But soon, hardline Conservative MPs must decide whether they care so much about ideology that they are prepared to vote down an imperfect deal.If they do that, they risk losing the lot.And by opening the way to emergency extensions of our membership until we come up with another plan, they could condemn Britain to staying in the awful organisation that elevated Martin Selmayr to power.Times/News SyndicationOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He and Corbyn wanted IRA victory, achieved through ­murder. McDonnell wanted Provos “honoured”. He praised them for bombing their way to the negotiating table.As for the anti-Semite Corbyn, how chuffed he must be that 40 per cent of Jews could flee Britain if he wins power.

McClure, in return, created a GoFundMe campaign with her boyfriend Mark DAmico to raise money for Bobbitt to thank him.This week, we revealed all £310,000 in his fund was gone, with McClure and her boyfriend Mark D’Amico accused of plundering the donations.Police confirmed last night they searched their house in New Jersey, as they investigate what happened to the cash. Cops were seen towing away the couples BMW.The couple is now accused of paying Bobbitt only a portion of the funds while using the rest on gambling and holidays.GoFundMe made an announcement in a joint statement with a Philadelphia law firm representing Bobbitt, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.The statement said: “GoFundMes goal has always been to ensure Johnny gets [the] support he deserves. Well continue to assist with the ongoing law enforcement investigation.”Company policy states that donors have until 30 days of making their contribution to submit claims asking for a refund.Images showed cops inspecting the couples black saloon BMW before it was put on the back of a low-loader and taken away.A police spokesman said: “Due to the enormous public interest in this matter, I am confirming that a search warrant was executed early this morning at the residence of Mark D’Amico and Katelyn McClure in connection with a criminal investigation into the Johnny Bobbitt matter.“As of this time, there have been no charges filed.His lawyer Christopher C. Fallon Jr. told nj: There is no money left. Where the money went, I have no idea.He added that his client was completely devastated.It comes a week after Bobbitt revealed there was only £105,000 left with the couple admitting to spending half the cash.Since the incident McClure and DAmico have been on holidays Las Vegas and Los Angeles.Bobbitt also revealed he is back on drugs.In an interview with the Inquirer last week, DAmico said he controls the money and will start dispensing it when Bobbitt gets a job and stops using drugs.Giving him all that money, its never going to happen. Ill burn it in front of him, he said, adding that giving an addict the money would be like giving him a loaded gun.Instead of the house they promised to buy him the couple bought him a camper van and put it on land owned by a relative.They have since told him to leave saying he stole from them and blew the cash handouts they gave him on drugs.The couple say they spent £155,000 on the camper, the hotel Bobbitt stayed in beforehand, an SUV, TV, laptop, two cell phones, £19,000 in cash which they claim he blew through and a £23,000 fee taken by GoFundMe.Bobbitt questions the couples motives and fears they may have squandered the money.I think it might have been good intentions in the beginning, but with that amount of money, I think it became greed.

My husband and parents had to go through that – every day was touch and go.“When I talk to my doctors and ask ‘where are your other clostridium septicum patients because I want to see where they are in a year’ they say they’re all dead.“People really don’t survive this so I’m considered very, very lucky.”The bacteria that caused Julie’s necrotising fasciitis is believed to have a mortality rate of up to 97 per cent.The keen gardener believes having a routine blood test the week before, which showed she had a very low white blood cell count, saved her life.“Normally people who are healthy can fight it. We’re all exposed to it because we all go outside. It’s very rare that it enters the body and attacks,” Julie said.“On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving Id had a routine blood test. I’d been run down and working a lot.“The nurse called me the next day and said my white blood cells were very low.“She said ‘if you get sick you need to go to the emergency room because you don’t have many white blood cells.’ That’s what saved me really.”On the Saturday – two days after Thanksgiving – Julie was taken to A\u0026ampE by her husband, Herbert Rosenfeld, 53, screaming in excruciating pain.After five hours on extremely high doses of painkillers, Julie said doctors were at a loss but when Julie’s right leg suddenly turned purple and she was rushed to surgery.“I should have been passed out by then from all the pain medication theyd given me, yet I was still screaming in agony,” Julie said.“After five hours the doctors figured out what was wrong. They were standing over me and my leg suddenly turned a deep purple.“They did a CAT scan which showed a gas bubble from my hip down to my ankles.“When the bacteria eats the flesh it leaves behind a gas bubble due to the toxins it releases.“They told my husband that night the chances were I wasn’t going to make it.”Julie spent three weeks in Yale New Haven Hospital where she had surgeries to cut away the dead tissue from her right leg and was given high doses of antibiotics.“I also became septic because it got into my blood. I was in an induced coma for over a week when my organs started to fail,” she said.“The only way to cure necrotising fasciitis is to find out what bacteria caused it and put you on crazy doses of antibiotics.“The main loss was in my hip and my buttock so there wasn’t going to be enough structure left to support it. They wheeled me away to amputate but then, by some miracle, they didn’t have to.“They had to keep the wounds open until the bug stopped eating and left that black tissue behind.“Once all the brown dead stuff was gone they could sew me up, but that left the giant wound which was grafted. I was there another month and a half while the wounds healed.“My right buttock is pretty much gone so I’m going to have more surgery to try and fix that but that’s more cosmetic now.”By the end of December 2017, Julie was stable enough to be transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she was reunited with her children, Camryn, nine, and Ethan, 11.There she was given skin grafts to help patch up the holes left by surgery.After almost losing her right leg and being bed-bound for more than three months, Julie had to learn to walk again and nine months later she has just stopped using a walking stick.“When I came home I had to learn to walk again. That was the hardest part – coming home and recovering,” Julie said.“I went into a deep depression. It’s been the hardest thing in my life. I’m taking high doses of Oxycodone every day and anti-depressants.“I could only shower every third day and that would tire me out completely.”Now, almost ten months later, Julie has been able to return to work and is lucky enough to have survived with just the scars as a memory of her ordeal.“At the beginning of this summer I slowly started to feel better and go to physical therapy,” she said.“I thought I might never walk again but gradually I was walking with a walker, then a cane and now nothing.“I’m back at work and walking around with a slight limp that most people don’t notice.“Everything is now healed and medically okay.“In that same time period, over the past 18 months, my husband had a brain tumour and two heart attacks.“When this happened to me, he’d already had a heart attack and a benign brain tumour so my poor kids have been through a lot, but at the same time they’ve seen us survive it all.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429324150.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"elon musk smokes a joint live on youtube during podcast interview with joe rogan","story":"The Tesla CEO, 47, puffed on a joint during his chat on the Joe Rogan Experienc amid a pending law suit from Vern Unsworth who Musk publicly branded a paedophile.Towards the end of the interview, which lasted for more than two hours, Rogan sparked the cannabis-filled roll-up and offered it to Musk.Assuming that the South African-born businessman would not accept, the podcast host said: “You probably cant do this because of stockholders, right?”But to Rogan’s surprise, Musk reached over and took a drag from the joint saying that the drug was legal in the state of California.The pair also enjoyed whiskey while chatting about the tycoon’s many business interests including his flamethrower product which Musk admitted was inspired by the 1987 movie Spaceballs.Musk has made headline in recent weeks after he accused Unsworth, who helped rescue 12 schoolboys from a cave in Thailand, of being a paedophile.Despite repeating the unsubtrainated allegation in public, Musk spoke about the importance of being kind with Rogan.He said: “Be nicer to each other. Dont assume someone is mean. Its easy to demonise people.”Unsworth is a British expat who lives near the Tham Luang cave network in Thailand where 12 boys and their football coach were trapped from June 23 until July 10.He was scathing of Musks offer to send a mini-submarine to help in the rescue efforts, which he dismissed as just a PR stunt.Musk hit back at Vern in a bizarre series of tweets, some of which he later deleted.He claimed it was suspicious the expat lived in Thailand before explicitly branding him a paedo.After apologising for the slur, he took to Twitter again on August 28, this time to question why diver Vern hasnt sued him in wake of the remarks.The billionaire this week labelled the cave diver a child rapist in a rambling email to reporters - prompting the Brit to reveal he is planning to sue Musk in three different countries."},{"url":null,"title":"apology flowers sent wrong door mistake","story":"Chris Knott, 26, from Hove found the misplaced flowers and note addressed to Soraya after they were pushed through his letter box late last night.The note read: I know I have been an idiot!

The London area could even see a high of 26C on Tuesday.“At the moment it is looking very promising for the middle to the end of the week and there will be bright conditions on the horizon.“Certainly to see in mid 20s in September is always welcome for those longing for summer to make a return.”The British summer this year was the joint-warmest since records began more than a century ago.Nationwide temperatures topped the league table dating back to 1910 — joining the sweltering summers of 2006, 2003 and 1976.Summer 2018 was notably dry and sunny too as the arid conditions witnessed in June and July offset the more average August.And forecasters say the sweltering summer weather looks set to last right through to November.Above-average temperatures are being predicted as weather experts say high-pressure systems will hold off much of the cold and wet weather.The Met Office said in its three-month outlook covering August, September and October that there is an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth fifth child car kids watch","story":"In the video the woman can be heard screaming as she faces the rear window with her knees on the passenger seat.Her husband, who is driving the motor, is filming the entire thing as they speed down the road.As the video begins he can be heard asking: “Can you wait like two minutes?”It is unclear exactly what his wife replies but it becomes apparent that the baby is well on its way out.He adds: “Hold on, wait, wait, wait,” but his wife keeps screaming and says “I don’t know what’s happening.”Seconds later crying can be heard and she is holding her new born daughter in her arms.After all the drama unfolds in the front of the car he pans the camera round to the back seat to show their other kids looking on in utter amazement.The astonishing footage, thought to have been filmed in Dallas, Texas was up loaded to social media and has already drawn thousands of hits.Posted on the Instagram page @theswinneyseven the video was captioned by : “There was something beyond special, about getting to deliver my own baby.“No doctors or nurses, no lights, or busy people, no one interrupting a moment that should be the most special moments for families as they bring life into the world.“The pain was there, but the joy and peace that followed in those minutes we got to spend alone with our sweet girl was more rewarding then anything I could have asked for.“I witnessed my body take over and a baby be born into my hands.

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary.

Food safety standards should not be used as a bargaining chip as Britain strikes trade deals after we leave the European Union, the paper by the Food Research Collaboration says. In Hormone-Treated Beef: Should Britain accept it after Brexit? Professors Erik Millstone and Tim Lang also called on farmers, supermarkets and butchers to make explicit commitments to consumers never to produce or sell hormone-treated beef. The report, published on Friday, warns that unlabelled hormone-boosted meat could enter the food chain while still illegal in the EU, risking a boycott of British exports. Countries including the US and Canada allow the use of hormones to boost muscle growth in cattle, but the meat from these animals is banned in the EU.  Dr Lang, professor of food policy at City, University of London, said: The UK Government should ensure either that food standards remain fully aligned with EU standards, or that we adopt higher standards. There is a triple risk here: to health, to British beef farmers\u0027 livelihoods, and to the UK\u0027s ability to determine its own food safety standards. Hormone use is a test case for whether the UK seeks a more sustainable food supply. Hormone use would be a stupid step towards intensive beef feeding lots. Fears over food standards post-Brexit have already been voiced as the Government seeks trade deals with countries around the world.  In June Compassion in World Farming said the UK will come under intense pressure to accept lower standards once its food production industry is removed from EU structures which currently guarantee high welfare for animals. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has already made clear the UK will have to adopt American standards in order to secure a post-Brexit trade deal, the charity said. It is also one of the many sticking points involving the Irish border, with British acceptance of the hormone-infused cattle seen as incompatible with a soft line between the Republic and Northern Ireland.

The Twickenham MP said: “I’m determined to lead the Liberal Democrats through this. “Once Brexit is resolved or stopped and the new rules are agreed that will be the time to hold a leadership election”. In a speech setting out his vision for his party, Sir Vince warned liberal democracy was facing a threat which was “the greatest since the 1930s” and said that he wanted to bring “values back into our politics”.  The veteran politician spoke of how he had failed to boost the size of the party at the pace he had wished to. He said the Lib Dems should “engage more actively with millions of voters who share our values” but have been turned off electorally. Sir Vince acknowledged the party had been severely damaged by going into coalition with the Tories. “We have made impressive strides to restore our position in local government where we had the best results for 15 years.” But he said he hoped to see a more dramatic change looking for inspiration to “that of the Canadian liberals who rose from being a distant third party to being the party of government.” He spoke of being influenced by the “broadly-based movement” they created in Canada. And he called for a new class of supporters who pay nothing but who sign up to the party’s values. They would have the right to vote in leadership and to shape the party’s policy online.  He said the supporters’ scheme would open at the party’s conference in Brighton next weekend. Referencing the supporters scheme introduced by Labour which led to a huge influx of new members to the party, he acknowledged the way in which the “revolutionary left” had taken over Labour was a “salutary warning”. But he said: “We can’t be afraid of opening a window in case a few flies get in”. He insisted the Liberal Democratic movement was different. And he spoke of removing the time delay for new members who wanted to be candidates. He said the party should open up its leadership to those who are not MPs. He praised his colleagues in the parliamentary party and said: “Any one of them have the ability to lead the party in the future.” But he said they had nothing to fear from a wider field. Deputy leader Jo Swinson and education spokeswoman Layla Moran are tipped as the frontrunners to take over the party reins.

The former prime minister said Labour under Corbyn is now a different party and he hopes it is not lost. His comments come after another leading figure of the Blair era, Lord Blunkett, warned that the party is facing irrelevance unless there is a rethink of the Corbyn project.  Mr Blair told the BBC: I\u0027ve been a member of the Labour Party for over 40 years. You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it\u0027s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?  This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don\u0027t know.  Mr Blair\u0027s comments follow Frank Field\u0027s resignation of the party whip over the anti-Semitism row and allegations of bullying among members.  The veteran MP, who served as welfare minister in Mr Blair\u0027s cabinet, cited a culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation among his concerns. Mr Blair said: There\u0027s lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party\u0027s lost, that the game\u0027s over. I\u0027m kind of hoping they\u0027re not right. The former PM said the row over anti-Semitism that has engulfed the party is ghastly and a matter of great sadness. He said he could not have imagined the row taking place in the way it did in the Labour Party I joined, all the way through to this moment. I can\u0027t imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country, he said. Speaking on Nick Robinson\u0027s Political Thinking Podcast, Mr Blair said: I don\u0027t think the British people will tolerate a situation where, for example, the choice at the next election is Boris Johnson versus Jeremy Corbyn. I don\u0027t know what will happen and I don\u0027t know how it will happen. But I just don\u0027t believe people will find that, in the country as a whole, an acceptable choice. Something will fill that vacuum.  Brexit news: Allowing \u0027hormone\u0027 beef imports after UK leaves EU would create public health risk, report warns  Speaking after Mr Field\u0027s resignation, Mr Corbyn said he did not see why he had to resign the Labour whip. I invite all MPs to take part in the discussion and the debate, he said. Obviously bullying and intimidation have no place whatsoever in any political party, particularly the Labour Party, but there has to be democratic debate within the party.

So imagine you are Nicolas Aujula who reckons he has lived at least a thousand previous lives and been reincarnated time and time again. But it\u0027s not all been kings, queens and emperors for Nicolas. He said: “I\u0027ve remembered living the life of a hard working Chinese seamstress, a privileged life of royal Egyptian queen and a monk living a life of solitude reflection.  Nicolas says he discovered his ious reincarnations at age 17 after falling into a trance which stimulated past-life recall. I\u0027ve been an embalmer of dead bodies and a closeted transgender soldier in Saxon England. I\u0027ve lived animal lives of a deer, lion, falcon to name a few, an anti-establishment French school teacher, a sailor that travelled the seven seas and a Middle Eastern nomad in the desert. I\u0027ve been an African witch doctor, an Ottoman spy sent to gather information, a persecuted pagan, a tribesmen that died through substance overdose and grey skinned being  on another planet”. Recalling the first time he knew about his past lives he said: “It was a surreal moment where I felt like I had left my body and started seeing vivid flashbacks in my mind. It was an inner knowing that what I was seeing was me but in another time and place - that I had past-lives. I don\u0027t fear death personally as a result I just see it a doorway into another experience.”  It dawned on me that there is no death that I have this physical body that dies but my consciousness, soul, continues on taking with it\u0027s life experiences, personality and life impressions. This changed my entire outlook as I realised I\u0027ve lived as a male, female, transgender, animal and even beings  in other parts of the universe. At the time Nicolas discovered his \u0027past\u0027 he was studying for his A-levels, planning to go to university.  However his unexpected experience inspired him to leave his education behind to pursue an alternative path as a researcher in Reincarnation and practitioner of \u0027Past Life Regression\u0027.  With over half the world\u0027s population believing in Reincarnation and Sir Paul McCartney told an interview this week he thought his dead wife Linda McCartney had been reborn as a white squirrel during a drug trip.    Nicolas who has previously appeared on Channel 4 documentary \u0027Man Vs Weird\u0027 and Biography Channels TV-series \u0027Our Psychic Family\u0027 thinks that we can also come back as an animal, that this is just another form to experience life.  Commenting on Sir Paul\u0027s vision Nicolas said: This is all possible. Just as we can be reborn to take a human form in the same manner we can be born as an animal, they too have a soul consciousness. Linda was a strict vegetarian and an animal rights campaigner, it makes sense that if it was her soul\u0027s will to experience life as an animal then that is possible. She had a great love and affinity for them, maybe she felt more at peace and home with animals than humans with the kind of work she was involved in.”     Nicolas is based between London and Los Angeles and works as a Street Hypnotist, Past Life Regressionist and Astrologer.  Nicolas said “Problems, behaviours and health issues often stem from past lives as we unconsciously carry forward experiences, attitudes and old dynamics into this life, these can surface in many ways”. Revealing further “I used to suffer from chronic sore throats throughout my childhood and would be so afraid to speak out that I was a quiet observer. However what I realised in some of my past-lives is that I was hung for speaking out against injustice of slavery in Rome, beheaded for my position as a Landowner and persecuted for my pagan views by Christians in another life. It made so much sense as to why I felt like this and having to keep quiet, it helped me immensely that my throat problems have completely cleared. I\u0027ve since felt secure to be open and communicate with ease.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit holidaymaker stunned saw boat","story":"NewsBrit holidaymaker stunned when she saw boat full of 12 migrants pull up while she sunbathedBritish holidaymaker annoyed her week in Spain was ruined by migrants running up the beach to a better lifeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRob AndrewsKelly-Ann Mills12:15, 7 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/i-sunbathing-beach-12-migrants-13205886,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British holidaymaker has spoken of her shock when her week-long trip to Spain was rudely interrupted by 12 migrants arriving on the beach by boat.

Next week, to mark the anniversary, some ‘Lehman Brothers and Sisters’ are having a reunion cocktail and canapes party. Which is a funny way of remembering the moment they brought down a decade of vicious austerity onto the heads of those who did nothing to cause the crash and could least afford to pay for it. As the campaign 10 Years On puts it – “the banks got bailed out to the tune of \u0026pound130 billion of our money, while we got sold out by austerity”. So, next week, we’re marking the 10-year anniversary with our own events – celebrating not bankers’ greed but the extraordinary spirit of the people who have spent a decade fighting back.  The ‘ordinary’ people who have run food banks and soup kitchens, supported family and friends, and resisted welfare cuts, insecure jobs and stagnant wages. Our events – on Sunday at Sunshine House Community Centre in Wigan and on Tuesday at the People’s History Museum in Manchester – will tell the stories of the people who were the collateral damage, through our Wigan Pier Project. Cleaners, nurses, lollipop ladies. Disabled and elderly people. Warehouse workers, fast food servers. Everyday people. Our Wigan Pier journey – inspired by George Orwell’s expedition eight decades ago through the Depression-hit Midlands and North – began in January 2017 when we set off from a cold Birmingham back street where a homeless man had died overnight. The last 20 months have been an extraordinary experience for me and colleagues Claire Donnelly and Andy Stenning – recorded at wiganpierproject.  We have spent months chatting to people in doorways, homeless shelters, food banks, community centres, bus stops and in their freezing, damp homes. I’ll never forget the man sobbing with bandaged arms  in the Portakabin food bank in  Staffordshire.  Or Rita Culshaw, the former ‘pit brow lass’, whose job it was as a young girl to sort coal from dirt. Or taking veteran campaigner Harry Leslie Smith back to the slum in Barnsley where he lived after his dad lost his job down the pit.  The people we’ve met are literally my Real Britain. Generous, kind, warm-hearted people who share what little they have. People who volunteer with kids, support newly arrived refugees, spend hours sorting food bank shelves or drive elderly people to the doctors. People like the wonderful staff and volunteers at Wigan’s Sunshine House. We started out with a copy of Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier, now held together with Sellotape, determined to try to live up to that great writer’s capacity for empathy and insight. But also to do some things he wasn’t able to in 1936. To let people speak directly through video and first-person stories in their own voice. And, also, to try to forge a relationship with Wigan itself, a town that has felt itself in the shadow of that book all these years. After we set out, my dad told me that his granddad – another George – had apparently come from Wigan, but almost nothing was known about his life before he ended up in North Wales where his daughter, my nainie, was born.

Beau managed to revive Beatrice as she was about to be put down due to equine colic after rescuers had failed to save her after six hours. He received an Animal Hero Award at last night\u0027s star-studded ceremony for his efforts, reports Shropshire Live.  The awards celebrate the best examples of bravery, dedication and resilience in the animal world. The Mirror joined forces with the innovative pet food, treats and toys brand, Webbox and the UK’s leading animal welfare charity, the RSPCA, to pick the most inspiring animals along with the individuals and teams who have shown outstanding commitment to improving their lives.  Farmers Donald MacIntyre and his wife Jane Lipington, from Bath, feared the worst when they found mare Beatrice prostrate in her stable in Bath, with severe abdominal pain due to equine colic. Her one tonne weight had made her legs go dead, meaning she was unable to get up and was at risk of fatal organ failure if she stayed on the ground. The desperate owners - who have 23 of the rare breed horses - and four farm hands spent six hours trying to turn and lift the 17-year-old mare with the help of a tractor and straps, to no avail. As Beatrice’s temperature rose to dangerous levels and her heart rate dropped, they spoke to the vet and sadly agreed a deadline to have her put down. But 20 minutes before the allocated time, they decided to let her 12-year-old mate Beau say his goodbyes. He had been watching events quietly from the next stall all day and refusing to eat.  The stallion leaned over the stable door and started nipping at Beatrice, getting hold of her halter with his teeth and shaking it. He then lifted her head up and helped the shaky horse into a more upright position, with the rescuers assisting. Jane, 61, said: “It is absolutely astonishing. We were prepared to lose her but Beau knew what to do. They have a close relationship, they are always together and don’t really mix with the other horses. “As we walked Beatrice round, we called the vet and he was astounded. We are used to seeing extraordinary interactions between the horses but we have never witnessed one save another’s life before. “Beau achieved what six hours of human endeavour with straps and machinery had failed to. He managed to lift Beatrice up off the floor which has allowed her to live on.  Beatrice has since made a full recovery from her illness in January 2018, thanks to the help of her ‘husband’ of ten years. The happy couple have since had a second foal together. The winners were honored at a glittering ceremony hosted by Amanda Holden, with a host of famous faces in attendance including Ferne McCann, Vicky Pattison, Laura Whitmore, Candice Brown, Ashley Roberts, Amber Davies and many more. Host Amanda Holden said “All of our winners are truly amazing, and when you hear their stories it fills you with hope.

The former footballer, accused of driving a Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone in London, will try to have the case thrown out on a technicality, arguing that the notice didn\u0027t arrive within the statutory 14-day window. There are practically no defences in court for driving over the speed limit, a legal expert has told the Liverpool Echo. But a driver can have the charge dismissed if they can prove that the notice arrived too late, like Beckham is attempting to do, said Phoebe Callender, legal adviser at DAS Law.  Here, Ms Callender explains the rules surrounding a notice of intended prosecution and what happens if one is delivered too late to a vehicle\u0027s registered keeper. What are the rules surrounding the notification of a fine? When you receive a speeding fine, the first notification you will receive is called a notice of intended prosecution  which is where you need to inform the police who was driving at the time under Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1998. This notice should be sent to the registered keeper within 14 days of when the speeding offence took place. If you don’t send the police the driver’s details within the time they state, then you can face up to six penalty points and a fine which is usually \u0026pound100. After this you will be sent notification of whether they will be offering you points and a fine a speed awareness course or if it will progress to a court summons. Can I have a fine dismissed if it was delivered ‘late’?  Under the Road Traffic Act 1998, the NIP has to be sent to the registered keeper within 14 days of the speeding offence. If when you receive the NIP it is dated more than 14 days after the offence took place, then you should send it back to the process office and reject it as it is out of time. If you are not the registered keeper of the car and you receive the NIP past 14 days, you have to check to see if they sent it to the registered keeper within the time period. If it has been, then it won’t be classed as late. If you fail to receive a NIP and only receive a court summons, then you can have a defence to the speeding offence and any subsequent prosecution that takes place. How do I challenge a speeding fine? It is very difficult to challenge a speeding fine as there are practically no defences to why a person was driving over the speed limit, even if you believe it’s not fair. You may be able to challenge it if the notice was incorrect e.g. the date, time, location of the speeding offence. However, spelling mistakes or minor mistakes like the colour of a vehicle etc. will not be accepted. Challenging the evidence of the camera itself can be also tricky as unless you have evidence that the camera is faulty then it is unlikely that you will be able to challenge your speeding fine successfully. Should I use a lawyer/barrister to handle my case or can I do it myself?

The law on lights is simple enough: you must use car headlights from half an hour after sunset until half an hour before sunrise. But there is a surprising exception to this rule. If you\u0027re travelling under 30mph in a brightly-lit area, you don\u0027t legally have to have them on - though you do still need your sidelights. It\u0027s an odd quirk of the law, but is it recommended? It\u0027s generally agreed that using dipped headlights at night is always the best option - making you more visible to other road users as well as improving your view of the road ahead. But if you do choose to use just your sidelights, make sure you don\u0027t fall foul of the rules - or you risk a \u0026pound50 fine. Not a bright idea. Make sure you know the rules  It\u0027s absolutely crucial that, at all times of the year, your car has a full set of working lights.  As well as an MOT failure, driving with a faulty or damaged light could mean a fixed penalty notice, or three points on the driving licence plus a bigger fine if it goes to court .   Since 2011, it\u0027s also been a legal requirement for all new cars sold in the EU to have daytime running lights . The new UK MOT rules mean that cars registered after March 2018 will need to have these working to pass the test.  Research has shown that DRLs are likely to reduce multiple vehicle daytime accidents and fatalities by up to 6% once all vehicles are equipped.   If you don\u0027t have DRLs on your car, then it\u0027s acceptable to leave your sidelights on all the time. Many cars will automatically turn sidelights on if they have an auto mode for lights, they will also switch to dipped lights when its sensor feels it\u0027s dark enough. The law states that you need your dipped headlights on between sunset and sunrise - but there\u0027s no harm turning them on early to improve your visibility to other road users. Check your lights regularly  The best way to do this is with a friend who can confirm that the reverse and brake lights are all working. Alternatively, you can use a reflective surface like a garage door. You can check hazard/indicator lights yourself as well as the running lights and dipped/main beam settings. If you notice a bulb isn\u0027t working, then pop to Halfords - they will select and fit replacement bulbs to your car for a small fee, and there\u0027s no need to book beforehand.  For a more comprehensive check that everything is working as it should, make an appointment online or in-store for a Free Car Check . As well as a bulb check, they\u0027ll also check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up!  Don\u0027t be dazzled  As nights get earlier we all have to contend with headlights dazzling us. Remember that most rearview mirrors these days offer protection from bright lights from behind. On newer cars you\u0027ll often have an auto-dimming mirror - which means you just let it protect you from being distracted by overly-bright lights. If you find yourself struggling to see, you\u0027ll notice an off switch to disable the feature. On older cars it\u0027s common that your rear view mirror will have a small mechanical switch underneath it. Flip that and the mirror will change angle, without adjusting the view you see. This is used to stop you from being dazzled in the same way a modern electric system works.  If your car has an old manual mirror then why not upgrade to an EchoMaster Dynamic Mirror and Reversing Camera Kit  for \u0026pound149. A reversing camera is fitted behind your number plate by a bracket. This rearview mirror also auto-dims, perfect for autumn driving! Halfords will also fit the whole system for \u0026pound75.  Keep your car clean  A dirty car looks bad, but it might also get you in to trouble. The law states that your number plate needs to be clean and visible at all times. You also need to make sure that brake lights are clean and clearly visible.  As well as using a good car cleaner you should also make sure your windscreen and lights are clean. Use a specialist glass cleaning product like Autoglym Car Glass Polish , \u0026pound8. You can pair that with the Demon Car Valet Pack  - priced \u0026pound24.50  to get every part of your car shiny as new.

At least two children are reported to have been hurt in the drama at the playground in Greggs Wood Road in High Brooms, an area of Tunbridge Wells, Kent. A set of swings and a climbing frame have been dismantled and removed to stop other children playing there as an urgent investigation began. Local resident Shaun Veness was with his three-year-old daughter Poppy at the playground when she received a shock. Shaun, who also had the family dog with him, said I put Poppy on the swings, gave her a push and felt a bit of static.  I pushed her again and she started crying saying it hurt. When I took her off the swing, I felt the chain - it wasn\u0027t static, it was a running current. It felt like an electric cattle fence. My hair was on end all day. He said local people had talked about at least one other child also getting a shock from the equipment. Shaun made a complaint and three pieces of equipment were removed from the play area the same day. Shaun added Poppy is okay and we\u0027ve gone back since but it has fascinated me how this could happen. Mum-of-two Rachel Betts, who lives near the park, said children regularly use the play equipment. She added: This is horrific - me and my husband couldn\u0027t believe it.  The play area is on a housing estate developed by Town and Country Planning, and many young families live there. Town and Country Planning confirmed the play area\u0027s proximity to high-voltage equipment is forming part of its investigation. A spokesman said: As there had not been any reports of issues previously, it seems to be as a result of the unique weather conditions. We will work with UK Power Networks to re-design the equipment to mitigate against potential risk in the future. We are continuing to investigate the cause and are unable to speculate further until these investigations are complete. A spokesman from Electrical Safety First, a charity which works to prevent death and injuries caused by electrical accidents, said: This is not simply a case of static but of a possible live current running through the chains of these children\u0027s swings.

Either the date and the exact time were overlaid on the image, or the staff of the Russian GRU learned to walk simultaneously - but their images are captured in two different photographs, said Russia\u0027s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zhakarova.

But the images suggest Petrov and Boshirov split up to and each go down a different thin corridor at the same time. Arrivals at Gatwick Airport must go down a number of thin gate corridors after leaving customs. So the time is exactly the same because the suspects will have gone through different segments alone.  Yet Russian social media users mocked Britain. One wrote: Yes, the corridors  are different. These are corridors at border control. But what an amazing synchronization of the GRU\u0027s staff.

Pupils at Penyrheol Comprehensive in Swansea are required to wear trousers, skirts and shorts with the school badge on them.  But when around 70 came back from the summer holidays wearing incorrect uniforms, it is claimed they were denied education, Wales Online reports.  But the school denies the allegation, saying pupils were spoken to about their uniform but none were punished. The uniform code for the school dictates that from this term all school trousers, skirts and shorts have to incorporate the school logo, and follows a review of the school uniform over the last academic year.  The demand for uniforms, which are only available from two outlets, has meant that some families have been late to source the required items, leading to some pupils returning to the school after the summer holidays wearing trousers without the required school logo. Following their initial induction into the school, those without the correct trousers were gathered for a meeting to remind of the school’s dress code, and to establish if theirs had been ordered. But some parents say their children felt as though they had been punished, something the school has denied. One parent said: “Children at Penyrheol Comprehensive School are now being denied an education for not having a badge on their school trousers. “It was absolutely disgusting behaviour, with 70-odd children being kept in a hall all day and told they wouldn’t be welcome in the school or made to sit in the hall for the next year. “It completely ruined the year 7’s very first day at comprehensive school.”  Another said: “I agree with the school badge being on blazers or jumpers, but trousers? “Some parents simply can’t afford the uniform, despite the grants available, and it would cost too much to buy just one, and then wash it day in day out. “Surely there has to be some leeway? One mum of two pupils at the school has said that she has been unable to get the new uniform for her children in their correct sizes meaning that her daughter has had to wear plain trousers and skirts. Aimee Phillips, aged 34, said: It\u0027s really expensive and the quality isn\u0027t great. It\u0027s between \u0026pound15 to \u0026pound17 and they need at least two sets each. I can\u0027t get the correct size to fit my children.  One is in year 10 and the other is in year 8 and they are petite so I\u0027ve got to have them taken in. Parents have to pay to have them altered. They look horrendous. My daughter is wearing a plain skirt or trousers as I can\u0027t get anything to fit her. Mrs Phillips, from Gorseinon, believes that parents should be allowed to buy normal skirts and trousers for their children and have the badge put on them instead. She added: Children come in all shapes and sizes and they don\u0027t fit the children at all. The majority of them have been isolated as they haven\u0027t got the correct uniform. It\u0027s not allowing them an education. The children are really not happy. I think they should scrap the whole new uniform. If a child is wearing leggings then the parents should be called in but I don\u0027t see why they need another uniform. We should be able to get normal trousers and put the logo on.  Only two businesses, Picton Sports in Dafen, Llanelli , and Sew and Sew in Gorseinon have been licensed to use the school’s trademark.  Boys size children’s trousers are listed on the school website at a price of \u0026pound13.99 and adults \u0026pound14.99, while for girls it is \u0026pound14.99 and \u0026pound15.99.

Since its founding in Manchester in 1868, it has battled for workers and today represents five million people.   The Mirror looks back at milestones in its remarkable history.   Toiling for 14 hours a day, the pale, malnourished “white slaves” of Bryant and May’s match factory had precious  little light in their own lives.  Girls as young as 13 earned just five shillings  a week tipping sticks with deadly white phosphorous while the company’s wealthy shareholders \u0026shycelebrated massive dividends. The Victorian matchgirls of Bow, East London, had to buy their equipment, risked losing fingers in machinery, went bald from carrying boxes on their heads and were often hit by the foremen. They also landed hefty fines for talking, laughing, having dirty feet or going to the toilet without permission. But, far, far worse, they were being killed by “phossy jaw” – a foul-smelling cancer caused by swallowing phosphorous as they hurriedly ate their bread- and-butter lunches in the workroom. It was a miserable life for women like Sarah Chapman from Mile End. But in the summer of 1888 she and 1,400 brave colleagues snapped. The matchgirls went on strike and their stunning victory two weeks later energised a new union movement around the world.                 Years later, union leader and politician Henry Snell called their strike “one of the most important events in the history of labour organisation in any country.” And John Charlton, author of the book It Just Went Like Tinder: The Mass Movement and New Unionism in Britain, says: “The courage, fighting spirit and resolution of the matchgirls deserves the recognition accorded to the suffragettes of the following decades.” This July, on the 130th anniversary of the strike, a descendant of suffragette leader Sylvia Pankhurst acknowledged that link. Helen Pankhurst, 54, joined a march, in the footsteps of the matchgirls, organised by striker Sarah Chapman’s great-granddaughter, Samantha Johnson. Remarkably, Sam only discovered her ancestor’s role in the historic action by chance two years ago. The mum-of-two, 51, from Southampton, says: “I saw a post on a family history forum from \u0026shysome\u0026shyone trying to trace Sarah’s family.  “I found historian Anna Robinson had written a thesis about Sarah – and it was the start of a journey that has taken over my life. “The matchgirls’ strike really was a turning point in history. “It was the first time a strike by women and girls was successful – and still shows us what can be achieved with a little courage and determination. “But I had no idea how much the matchgirls still mean to people. The Bryant and May factory is now flats but every now and then someone chalks the names of the women and girls on the walls to ensure their names live on.” Sam is now battling to ensure her great-gran is properly remembered. For she discovered Sarah – who went on to marry, have six children and survive two world wars – is buried in a paupers’ grave threatened with being mounded over.  It seems the woman who changed British labour history ended her days in the poverty she helped others escape. It was in June 1888 that the matchgirls’ plight was revealed to the world. Socialist journalist Annie Besant decided to investigate conditions at the factory and spoke to workers. On June 23 she published a shocking expose in her paper, The Link, headlined White Slavery in London. It stormed: “Born in slums, driven to work while still children, under\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shy\u0026shysized because underfed, oppressed because helpless, flung aside as soon as worked out, who cares if they die or go on the streets, provided only that the Bryant and May shareholders get their 23%…?” Outraged bosses threatened to sue then tried to bully workers into denying her claims.  But on July 5, when Bryant and May fired three “troublemakers”, the 1,400 matchgirls walked out and 200 marched to Annie’s Fleet Street office to ask for her help. “We’d ’ave come before only we wasn’t agreed,” they said. “You stood up for us and we wasn’t going back on you.” Sarah Chapman and two colleagues, Mrs Cummings and Mrs Naulls, were invited in and a strike committee was formed. On July 8 the strikers had a first meeting and two newspapers backed their cause. And the London Trades Council, formed in 1860 to represent skilled tradesmen, gave \u0026pound20 to their fund. The strength and determination of the women stunned the middle classes who had viewed unskilled East End factory workers as worthless, tragic, or both. One woman noted: “Few could fail to be touched by the way in which the girls were determined to stand together.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast odds slashed","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Odds slashed on wettest September ever as Britain braced for downpours and thunderstormsThe country is set to be battered by torrential rain and gale-force winds as a fierce storm brews in the North SeaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNatalie Evans06:04, 7 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/whats-weather-going-like-you-13205553,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParts of the UK have been warned to brace for intense deluges and major thunderstorms with a wet and windy weekend in store. Britain is set to be battered by torrential rain and gale-force winds as a fierce storm brews in the North Sea. Forecasters are even warning of the risk of TORNADOES from today. The weather is expected to be so unsettled, bookies have slashed the odds on September being the wettest on record from 4/1 to 2/1.

It’s left us with no choice but to cut our odds on the wettest September on record, something which we can’t rule out at this early stage of the month.” But temperatures are set to soar again after the weekend with the promise of an Indian summer still on the cards.  Met Office Richard Miles said: “From Friday it will be cloudy and showery with some prolonged outbreaks of rain as a low-pressure system moves into the UK from the North Sea. “There will also be some strong winds particularly around western coasts and across northern Britain.  “It is a similar picture for Saturday and Sunday with the heaviest rain expected over high ground in the west although these showers will move eastwards. “Monday is looking like bringing more of the same as frontal systems push across central and southern areas. “However the southeast is likely to stay drier and and warmer as warm air moves in from the west driven by quite a strong jet from the Atlantic.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman whose baby decapitated womb","story":"NewsWoman whose baby was decapitated in womb felt \"loud pop\" as doctor pulled on infant\u0027s legsLaura Gallazzi claims the medic \"butchered\" her son and hid the truth from her when she gave her the devastating news that her baby boy Steven was deadShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByChris kitching08:01, 7 SEP 2018Updated08:33, 7 SEP 2018NewsDr Vaishnavy Laxman arrives for a tribunal hearing in May \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A mother whose baby was accidentally decapitated by a doctor as she gave birth says she felt a loud pop before chaos and panic swept through the delivery room.

The 34-year-old\u0027s premature son, Steven, was trapped in the breech position and, instead of performing an emergency Caesarean section, Dr Vaishnavy Laxman tugged on his legs in a bid to get him out.

Ms Gallazzi, who keeps her son\u0027s ashes in a teddy bear and has outlines of his hands and feet tattooed on her arm, said: She butchered my son. How could this happen in this day and age? She had been rushed straight into theatre after arriving at the hospital, where medics discovered that she had a prolapsed umbilical cord, which happens when the cord drops through the open cervix into the vagina ahead of the baby.  The cord can become trapped against the baby\u0027s body during delivery. Ms Gallazzi said she was told to push and, even though it felt completely wrong and she thought she would have a C-section, she did as Dr Laxman asked. She was only two to three centimetres dilated - less than the NHS guidelines of 10cm for a natural birth - and the doctor had twice cut her cervix. Dr Laxman, who was nearing the end of a 24-hour shift, tried a natural delivery instead of a C-section as the baby arrived on March 16, 2014. Ms Gallazzi said she felt the doctor pull on Steven\u0027s legs as other medics pushed down on her stomach. She said she begged Dr Laxman to stop because she was in so much pain, and tried to crawl away from her.  She said: “I could feel something between my legs and then all of a sudden I felt a massive, loud pop. I thought I’d done it. I thought he was out. “But then I felt a sense of chaos and panic throughout the room and I was being told to push again. Then I was told I was being put to sleep and the lights went out.” After her son died during birth, she woke up as she recovered in a room for mothers who have suffered loss in pregnancy. Her sister Louise was in tears and Dr Laxman soon came in and delivered the devastating news that Steven had died. Ms Gallazzi assumed the baby died because he was premature and claims she didn\u0027t know that his he had been decapitated. She said Dr Laxman sat down next to her on the hospital bed and told her that Steven had died.

The 47-year-old Tesla CEO was speaking about his electric car company on the Joe Rogan Experience when the host Joe Rogan, offered him a joint to smoke .  Musk puffed away on the marijuana-filled cigar after he confessed that running Tesla keeps him up at night. He said: It\u0027s very difficult to keep a car company alive, and admitted to relying on sleeping-drug Ambien. Stock prices at Tesla are plunging and Musk is expected to face a lawsuit after falsely announcing he was taking the company private and accusing a British hero diver of being a paedophile.  The billionaire has not substantiated his claims at all. Towards the end of the podcast, Rogan lit a \u0027cigar\u0027 which had been rolled with both tobacco and marijuana - a legal drug in the state of California - and offered it to Musk. Rogan asked Musk: You probably can\u0027t do this because of stockholders, right? Musk reminded Rogan of the drugs legality before taking a draw on the cigar and handing it back. He confessed: I\u0027m not a regular smoker of weed. Almost never.  I don\u0027t actually notice any effect. I know a lot of people like weed, and that\u0027s fine, however I don\u0027t find it\u0027s very good for pro-activity. The two and a half hour long podcast began with the pair discussing his dream of solving traffic problems in Los Angeles by building a tunnel underneath the city. Musk also discussed his fear of AI as they drank whiskey together. Musk also spoke about kindness, the week he escalated his baseless attacks on the British caver who helped free a group of Thai boys trapped in a cave and called him a “child rapist”. The 47-year-old faced a widespread backlash when he first called the diver Vern Unsworth a “pedo” on Twitter.  Now Musk, 47, has tripled down on his claims launching an extraordinary attack on the British hero. In an email to a journalist, the billionaire called Unsworth a “single white guy from England who’s been travelling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years”. Musk wrote: “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what\u0027s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you f****** a**hole. “He\u0027s an old, single white guy from England who\u0027s been travelling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man terrifies fellow ryanair passengers","story":"NewsMan terrifies Ryanair passengers calling Christians \"infidels\" and \"sharia the fairest rule of law\"The incident took place about 40 minutes before the flight from Barcelona was scheduled to land in SevilleShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAna Lacasa11:09, 7 SEP 2018Updated11:45, 7 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/world-news/video/man-shouting-allah-terrifies-passengers-13206246,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man left Ryanair passengers terrified after calling Christians infidels and saying that sharia is the fairest rule of law.

We have always said if the people of Lochee want to get a clock then we’d be happy to see that happen.”Myles McCallum, who sits on the Lochee Community Regeneration forum, said: “In my opinion, it shows you a lot of people in Lochee are quite passionate about the clock.“I think it is good the council is doing this consultation and the more the council and people work together the better that things will be.“Asking the community what they think is brilliant. I would love to see more of that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b910814d9b13-517x564.jpg ","title":"being with glen can help bens finnish chances","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s latest Finnish recruit Benjamin Kallman believes the presence of fellow-countryman Glen Kamara in the ranks at Dens Park can only improve his own international prospects.Although he’s had to withdraw from the Finnish squad for the Uefa Nations League clashes with Hungary and Estonia tomorrow and Tuesday because of injury, Kamara is regarded as one of his nation’s rising stars.And that means it’s likely national coach Markku Kanerva will be heading for Scotland at some stage in the coming months to check on the progress of both.“Having Glen Kamara here could help in the way that if the manager is checking how things are going for the team and there are two players here,” Kallman said.“It would be easier for the manager to look at a game if there’s two players who could possibly be in the squad. I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b910641f25e7.jpg ","title":"dundee folk nearly twice as likely to take bus compared with others in scotland","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new survey of Scots’ travel habits has revealed Dundonians are nearly twice as likely to take the bus compared with others in Scotland.The figures, published by Transport Scotland, show the bus is the main mode of transport to work for 16.4% of the city’s population, compared with 9.8% of typical Scots.While health chiefs aim to encourage people to avoid using the car, Dundee’s high volume of public transport use is likely due to necessity.Nearly half of Dundee residents – 44.8% – don’t have access to a car.And despite lower levels of car ownership Dundonians still report similar levels of congestion driving in the city compared with other parts of the country.Transport secretary Michael Matheson said: “The figures highlight the work we must continue in order to develop a greener and more sustainable transport network here in Scotland.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee have a real gem in young striker cedwyn scott says berwick boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee striker Cedwyn Scott has earned high praise after a brace on his debut for Berwick.Boss Robbie Horn was highly impressed by the teenager.His double came in a 5-3 win at Albion Rovers when he grabbed the third and fifth goals in a dramatic tie.Horn said: “My research had shown that Cedwyn was a good player but he is better than I had hoped for.

They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not

consider proposals for the new development at Ethiebeaton Park in Monifieth.If the application by Whitbread Group is approved, the coffee shop is expected to create up to 18 full-time and part-time jobs.The proposed development will take up some of the space of an existing car park used in association with the Premier Inn Hotel and Brewers Fayre Restaurant.Walsingham Planning said in a planning statement: “The proposed coffee shop and drive-thru will be open to the public 24 hours a day.“This is considered to be entirely acceptable given that the adjacent McDonald’s drive-thru restaurant is open or trading 24 hours a day.“Despite being a town-centre use, drive-thru facilities are, by virtue of their format, generally not suitable for town-centre environments.“The siting of a modern drive-thru building in Monfieith town centre would be highly unlikely to generate the required level of traffic flow to remain viable.“The proposed drive-thru is also completely different in format to traditional ‘dine in’ cafes that one may find in Monifieth town centre.”Four car parking spaces are expected to be lost because the new development will require the existing car park to be changed.Two disabled bays will be provided for use by Costa customers and there are plans to include a pedestrian crossing across from one of the parking aisles.Monifeith Community Council’s planning application contact Robin Crossland said any new business which helps the local economy is “very valuable”.He said: “People who are local are more likely to get the jobs too.“I think it’s a better idea than the

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary.

It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline.

And McInnes hailed Shinnie for retaining his spot in McLeish’s squad.He said: “Hopefully Graeme can continue to establish himself with Scotland not only through training with them but out on the pitch with game time.“With the squad Graeme was involved in at the end of last season there were a lot of the Celtic players and established players left out.“It was an opportunity for Graeme to go and show Alex his capability through his training and through games.“He has obviously done that and has also started the season well for us, especially in the two games against Burnley in the Europa League.“He was very influential in those games against Burnley.“Graeme has got the recognition for that by remaining in the squad and I am delighted for him.”Shinnie is the only Aberdeen player in McLeish’s Scotland squad that will face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium tonight.That friendly is a warm-up for the UEFA Nations League opener against Albania on Monday.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna would have been named in the squad if fit.However, the 21-year-old missed out with a hamstring tear that has ruled him out of Aberdeen’s last four games.McInnes anticipates McKenna, who captained Scotland in the 2-0 loss to Mexico, to return immediately after the international break.The subject of a rejected £7 million transfer deadline day bid from Aston Villa, centre-back McKenna is set to return for the trip to St Johnstone on Saturday September 15.McInnes hopes club captain Shinnie can face a Belgium side packed with world class talents such as Eden Hazard , Romelu Lukaku , Marouane Fellaini  and Vincent Kompany .He reckons facing opponents of that calibre can only help Shinnie’s own game improve.McInnes said: “Any time you go away to be involved with your country is a brilliant experience.“Graeme will be involved with some of the countries’ top players.“Then he will also hopefully get the games on top of that.“Ideally he can get game time against Belgium and Albania.“Belgium have some top class players involved and all of that is great for any player’s development.”McInnes and Aberdeen aim to tie up skipper Shinnie on an extended contract.The midfielder’s current deal expires at the end of this season and Shinnie would be free to speak with any interested club from the start of the winter transfer window on January 1.McInnes recently confirmed he would sit down with Shinnie and his agent to try to thrash out a new extended contract.The Aberdeen gaffer also confirmed he has been in regular contact with McLeish regarding Scotland internationalists.He said: “I spoke to Alex after the two Scotland games in the summer and a few times since.“Graeme has made a good impression and it is great to see him in the squad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"two dons games in november to be shown live1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo Aberdeen games have been chosen for live TV coverage after the selections for October and November were announced.The Dons\u0026#8217 trip to Kilmarnock has been moved to Sunday, November 4 with a 12.15pm kick-off.Aberdeen\u0026#8217s next fixture after Killie has also been selected.

A report released in May revealed contractor Robertson admitted it “incorrectly fitted” flooring and a sub-contracted joinery crew was to blame.But the former tenants dismissed its findings as “nonsense”, claiming it was not caused by a flooring problem.The flats, built on the site of the former Marchburn School in 2012, were some of the first council homes built for families in the city for 30 years.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “Residents made a deputation to Aberdeen City Council’s operational delivery committee.

the festivities at Milltimber Bridge the community of Culter are required to make a 10-mile round road trip.“It is not yet too late for Transport Scotland to change its mind and work with me and the Culter Community Council to ensure residents who have suffered through the building of the new AWPR are not further disrupted by having to go into Aberdeen in order to participate in something that is less than 400 yards from where they live.”Guus Glass, the chairman of adjoining Cults, Bieldside and Milltimber Community Council, has also written to Transport Scotland about the issue.The letter states: “It appears that residents within easy walking or cycling distance of the venue are expected to travel into the centre of Aberdeen or to take their car to Kingswells Park and Ride in order to access the shuttle bus service which we understand is the only means of entering the venue.“Yet these are the same people who over the last few years have had to accept frequent traffic dislocation, noise and dirt during the construction period.“We urge you to ask the event organisers to review the proposed arrangements to ensure that those communities nearest to the AWPR are able to take part easily in the event without suffering further inconvenience.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “We have asked our event organisers to get in contact with the community council so that we can work

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition-urge-sbcs-fragile-ruling-group-to-focus","story":"THE leader of the opposition has hit out at SBC\u0026rsquos administration \u0026ndash claiming they are more preoccupied with infighting than managing the council\u0026rsquos affairs.\nTweeddale East Councillor Stuart Bell  launched the attack after two elected members, Watson McAteer and Stuart Marshall, were \u0026ldquokicked out of the ruling group last Tuesday.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoI am deeply worried at the fragile state of the current Scottish Borders Council administration, and they are hardly 18 months old.\n\u0026ldquoThe executive committee was in turmoil last Tuesday as a result of a clumsy decision to expel one of their own councillors [Watson McAteer] and remove him from that committee.\n\u0026ldquoThe administration\u0026rsquos executive had on their agenda a number of significant and quite worrying financial reports.\n\u0026ldquoBut because this council\u0026rsquos collapsing administration seem to be more pre-occupied with in-fighting than with managing the council\u0026rsquos affairs, these important reports were given scant attention.\nAnd Cllr Bell, who chairs the scrutiny committee, says he will support an initiative of Councillor Clair Ramage  to \u0026lsquocall-in\u0026rsquo the report on the quarterly monitoring of the council\u0026rsquos revenue budget which was discussed on Tuesday.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoLast Tuesday\u0026rsquos executive had before them a report stating that just four months into the financial year officers are projecting \u0026lsquopressures in excess of budget\u0026rsquo of \u0026pound1.36m and that report added that less than a quarter of the savings being identified can be delivered on a permanent basis in line with the council\u0026rsquos financial plan.\n\u0026ldquoThe council executive has a responsibility, on behalf of the public, to scrutinise officers\u0026rsquo reports and actions, but they were too busy infighting to do this on Tuesday.\nBut leader Shona Haslam  hit back at the claims.

Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion

indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as

dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

Enterprise, Trade and Investment  had that information and did not share it with him.\nMr Bell was minister at the DETI, which oversaw the Renewable Heat Incentive  scheme.\nIt was intended to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to green alternatives such as biomass.\nBy the summer of 2015 the cost to the taxpayer was beginning to spiral as firms realised how lucrative the incentives on offer were.\nA public inquiry set up to examine what went wrong with the RHI scheme heard on Friday that there was a spike in applications in September and October before cost controls were applied in November.\nThe inquiry heard that applications increased by 100% in six weeks.\nMr Bell signed an order to introduce cost controls on September 3, but these did not come into effect until November.\nHe insisted he would have tried other mechanisms if he had known about the spike in applications.\n\u0026ldquoNobody informed me through the agreed processes of the department, so I wasn\u0026rsquot aware at all of the spikes in applications, nobody was even informally briefing me, he said.\n\u0026ldquoWhat causes me grave concern is why I wasn\u0026rsquot told after the first week, the second week, the third week, running right up to the sixth week.\n\u0026ldquoWhy if my department had the information, and why when my department had a mechanism to get urgent messages to the minister, why was none of this done.\n\u0026ldquoIf it is the case that Ofgem and others were telling my department about a surge in applications, had they told me after week one there had been such a surge, we can\u0026rsquot deal with it, then I would have looked at urgent procedure, I would have looked at other legislative mechanisms that were in our arsenal to address legislatively that sort of concern.\n\u0026ldquoBut nobody told me and that causes me grave concern that I was a minister in the department which seems now to have had that information but for whatever reason was not following the agreed process to bring that to the attention of the minister.\nThe inquiry also heard that at that time, the DUP had an \u0026ldquoin-and-out policy in terms of its ministers.\nIt was a protest move following the murder of Kevin McGuigan in Belfast in August 2015 and subsequent\u0026nbspstatement by PSNI Detective Superintendent Kevin Geddes that members of the supposedly decommissioned Provisional IRA had been responsible.\nDUP ministers resigned in opposition to sharing government with Sinn Fein, a party with historic links to the Provisional IRA.\nMinisters resigned for a number of days before returning to office for a number of hours and then resigning again.\nThis pattern was repeated to stage a protest without losing ministerial positions.\nMr Bell told the inquiry that this in-and-out policy did not have an impact on his work as a minister.\n\u0026ldquoDETI functions continued as normal, I returned on  weekly basis to deal with urgent business, and only resigned when all urgent business  dealt with, he said.\nAt the start of Friday\u0026rsquos hearing,\u0026nbspSir Patrick Coghlin warned that the inquiry is not a \u0026ldquomedia sensational

differences if they want to advance towards EU membership.\nOfficials from both nations have suggested a land swap could be a good idea, but there is opposition inside both countries and internationally.\nThere are concerns that changes to the borders could trigger similar demands in Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro, nations which were also formed after the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.\nGermany and some of its EU partners also have voiced fears this could open up old wounds in the Balkans rather than resolving their long-standing differences.\nFederica

losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere.

It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance.

And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.  The event is being held ahead of the submission of a series of applications, enacting the existing planning permission for the mixed-use development.  The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.  The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.  Fraser Lynes, land and development director for Cruden Homes , said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have the opportunity to take forward the great work carried out by Socially Conscious Capital and Taylor Architecture.  \u0026ldquoOur involvement in this development confirms our commitment to the county and complements our other developments in North Berwick, Aberlady and Dirleton.  \u0026ldquoWe fully believe in the design principles which are embedded in the existing consent and look forward to delivering a truly bespoke product in one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos best locations.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The site is a popular gathering place for youths in the area and, although covered by CCTV, it has not acted as a deterrent.  There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.  An external inspection in May 2011 found \u0026ldquoa fine former infant school which externally is in generally sound condition but vacant and in need of a new use.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.

Mr Bell was minister at the DETI, which oversaw the Renewable Heat Incentive  scheme.  It was intended to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to green alternatives such as biomass.  By the summer of 2015 the cost to the taxpayer was beginning to spiral as firms realised how lucrative the incentives on offer were.  A public inquiry set up to examine what went wrong with the RHI scheme heard on Friday that there was a spike in applications in September and October before cost controls were applied in November.  The inquiry heard that applications increased by 100% in six weeks.  Mr Bell signed an order to introduce cost controls on September 3, but these did not come into effect until November.  He insisted he would have tried other mechanisms if he had known about the spike in applications.  \u0026ldquoNobody informed me through the agreed processes of the department, so I wasn\u0026rsquot aware at all of the spikes in applications, nobody was even informally briefing me, he said.  \u0026ldquoWhat causes me grave concern is why I wasn\u0026rsquot told after the first week, the second week, the third week, running right up to the sixth week.  \u0026ldquoWhy if my department had the information, and why when my department had a mechanism to get urgent messages to the minister, why was none of this done.  \u0026ldquoIf it is the case that Ofgem and others were telling my department about a surge in applications, had they told me after week one there had been such a surge, we can\u0026rsquot deal with it, then I would have looked at urgent procedure, I would have looked at other legislative mechanisms that were in our arsenal to address legislatively that sort of concern.  \u0026ldquoBut nobody told me and that causes me grave concern that I was a minister in the department which seems now to have had that information but for whatever reason was not following the agreed process to bring that to the attention of the minister.  The inquiry also heard that at that time, the DUP had an \u0026ldquoin-and-out policy in terms of its ministers.  It was a protest move following the murder of Kevin McGuigan in Belfast in August 2015 and subsequent\u0026nbspstatement by PSNI Detective Superintendent Kevin Geddes that members of the supposedly decommissioned Provisional IRA had been responsible.  DUP ministers resigned in opposition to sharing government with Sinn Fein, a party with historic links to the Provisional IRA.  Ministers resigned for a number of days before returning to office for a number of hours and then resigning again.  This pattern was repeated to stage a protest without losing ministerial positions.  Mr Bell told the inquiry that this in-and-out policy did not have an impact on his work as a minister.  \u0026ldquoDETI functions continued as normal, I returned on  weekly basis to deal with urgent business, and only resigned when all urgent business  dealt with, he said.  At the start of Friday\u0026rsquos hearing,\u0026nbspSir Patrick Coghlin warned that the inquiry is not a \u0026ldquomedia sensational platform.  \u0026ldquoThere is no open invitation to witnesses to come along and use the hearings for the purpose of publishing material to which they object or take offence for reasons which are irrelevant to the inquiry, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not a media sensational platform.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and is recognised as a nation by more than 100 countries, but Serbia does not recognise it, and neither do five EU countries: Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain.  Serbia and Kosovo have been told they must sort out their differences if they want to advance towards EU membership.  Officials from both nations have suggested a land swap could be a good idea, but there is opposition inside both countries and internationally.  There are concerns that changes to the borders could trigger similar demands in Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro, nations which were also formed after the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.  Germany and some of its EU partners also have voiced fears this could open up old wounds in the Balkans rather than resolving their long-standing differences.  Although there are no fixed proposals on the table, the most commonly mentioned ideas always involve the so-called Presevo Valley area of Serbia, to be swapped for Kosovo\u0026rsquos Serb-populated north.  Zoran Ostojic, an analyst from Belgrade, believes the meeting in Brussels will not result in an immediate breakthrough.  Mr Vucic and Mr Thaci are \u0026ldquotesting the ground, primarily with the international community by floating the idea, he said.  \u0026ldquoWho knows where that could end? Mr Ostojic warned, echoing fears of a chain reaction throughout the Balkans.  The 1998-99 war erupted when Kosovo separatists launched a rebellion to split from Serbia after Belgrade had stripped the region of its self-rule.  More than 10,000 people died in the conflict before Nato forced Serbia to pull out of the territory."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8559973.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"binturong-cubs-take-first-steps-outside","story":"  The binturong cubs were recorded as they ventured into their large outdoor habitat at Edinburgh Zoo, under the watchful eye of their mother Poppy.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils-being-double-tested-in-quarter-of-councils","story":"  A survey by a teaching union found eight local authorities are continuing with their own standardised assessments despite the introduction of new Scottish Government tests.  When ministers announced the literacy and numeracy assessments for pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3 they said the should replace existing tests.  However, teachers who responded to a survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland  said at least eight of Scotland 32 local authorities were continuing with previous standardised assessments - although it is unclear how long this will remain the case.  The EIS warned the practice of \"double-testing\" increases teacher workload and puts too much pressure on pupils.  The survey also suggested at least 25 councils had introduced \"blanket testing\" - where all pupils sit the assessments at the same time.  The Scottish Government has previously said teachers should have the freedom to decide when pupils sit the assessments.  An EIS spokeswoman said: \"For these children, assessment was not an integral part of everyday learning and teaching and was not timed to support their individual learning. This was out of the hands of teachers.\"  The latest concerns over testing came on the day John Swinney, the Education Secretary, gave a statement to Scottish Parliament on the purpose of the assessments and whether parents had the right to opt out, which has caused confusion.  Mr Swinney used the statement to apologise to parliament for a \"misleading\" letter on controversial primary school tests sent by a senior civil servant.  The minister said that while he did not personally sign off on the letter from Graeme Logan, a deputy director at the Scottish Government\u0027s learning directorate, he took full responsibility for it.  However, Mr Swinney said he remained committed to the assessments at all levels, despite cross-party opposition and calls to \"cut his losses\" on the issue.  Mr Swinney said: \"I did not sign off the letter that was issued by the deputy director to directors of education, but I take full responsibility for it because I\u0027m a minister in the Scottish Government and it\u0027s right that I take full responsibility for it.  \"I can only apologise to parliament ... for the events that took place in that respect, but I take responsibility for it because I should take responsibility for it.\"  He stressed that the substance of the letter was consistent with the Scottish Government\u0027s position - that while there is no statutory right for parents to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling other than some parts of religious education, the tests were not compulsory.  Ross Greer, education spokesman for the Scottish Green Party, urged Mr Swinney to \"cut his losses\".  He said: \"In the case of P1 tests it\u0027s quite clear that a majority of this parliament want to see them go and sooner or later that is what we\u0027re going to vote for.\"  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, added: \"Faced with the evidence of stress on four and five-year-olds caused by these tests, testimony from teachers that they are time-consuming and of little educational worth, and a campaign by parents to boycott them, he is carrying on regardless.  \"In P1, at least, they should be suspended. I believe that\u0027s the view of this parliament and I hope we will have the chance to demonstrate that as soon as possible.\"  Mr Swinney said the assessments in P1 provided an early view of areas of weakness in literacy and numeracy that was vital in closing the attainment gap.  The assessments were introduced as a response to concerns over falling standards and a lack of consistent data."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8552179.jpg?type=article-full","title":"time-for-the-sniffy-men-to-take-notice-its-the-women-leading-the-way-in-scottish-football","story":"  Scotland featuring players from Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, topping a group which contained Switzerland and Poland to get to the World Cup.  But it is the jubilant women, not the men, that have been doing the country proud - as they clinched first place in their group and automatic qualification for France 2019 with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Albania.  While the women have qualified for their first ever\u0026nbspWorld Cup, it has been 20 years of hurt for Scotland\u0027s men who last reached a\u0026nbspWorld Cup proper in 1998, and even then only managed one draw before exiting after three group stage games.    No wonder people have been falling over themselves to acclaim the Scotland Women - including the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is a patron of the team.

And there will be a few of us planning to go to France next year.  \"I am of a certain vintage that says if the women qualify, then I am going.\"  He said that he felt the women appeared to show more pride in playing for their country than their male counterparts.    \"There are a few sceptics that are not convinced that many of the men take as much pride as the women do,\" he said.  \"Watch them singing the National Anthem, every single one of them does it. They show such commitment. That\u0027s what the fans demand of the men and I am not convinced that we get it.\"  Scottish Football Supporters Association director Paul Goodwin said interest in football amongst women had grown in the past ten years and there can only be an upward trajectory in the wake of the Scotland Women\u0027s success.  READ MORE:\u0026nbsp  He said that in the 60s he would be amazed to see a woman in the crowd at a football match in Scotland. At the last count, 2400 of their 30000 members were women.  When Scotland\u0027s Women beat their Swiss counterparts 2-1 at St Mirren Park last week, 4,098 attended, a record for one of their international matches.    Four years ago when Scotland won 2-0 against Poland at Fir Park, Motherwell in another vital World Cup qualifier, it attracted a crowd of 1551.  Just before the critical Albania game BBC Alba announced a set of new deals that would see the channel become the home of Scottish women\u0026rsquos football in a move that signalled a huge boost for the game\u0027s profile.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe deals include the live broadcast of any Scotland squad World Cup games in 2019.  \"We believe support for women\u0027s football will grow with this fantastic achievement and we have to build on that momentum,\" added Mr Goodwin.  \"More creative marketing should be put in to actually get more people to support the local women\u0027s teams \"There are people who will say that the standards are not the same as with the men\u0027s but it\u0027s like any sport it has to be seen in its own merits.  \"Nobody turns their nose up at [Scots middle-distance runner Laura Muir]. They don\u0027t say that the time she is running now is not as good as what Steve Cram managed in the 80s.\"    He said the fact the Scots team are playing in better teams in some of the biggest women\u0027s football leagues is having an impact.  \"If you look at where the men\u0027s game is, there are very few players in the English Premier League, they are mostly playing in the Championship [the second tier of English football]. But if you look at the women in European terms, they have players at Manchester United and Manchester City and it is playing at that higher level that is no doubt what is propelling them to the World Cup.\"  Alana Watson, who is also an SFSA director said that Shelley Kerr\u0027s Scots team will become role models for the young girls who are increasingly taking up the sport.  \"What they have done is a massive achievement at a time when the men\u0027s team has not qualified for an international tournament in the last 20 years. It shows that the standard of women\u0027s football in this country is going from strength to strength,\" said Ms Watson, who is a former coach.  \"Predominantly football is seen as a man\u0027s game so women are always going to be challenged to be recognised for their accomplishments in that field and with qualifying for the World Cup, that will hopefully change some people\u0027s views about it.  \"The numbers of, especially younger girls, who are involved in playing football and going along to a club and having that structured league that boys grow up with, that has definitely grown massively in the past decade, so for them to have role models who are women, who they can actually watch play football, that is going to inspire them even more.\"  She felt women\u0027s football was attracting those who prefer a more family friendly atmosphere - something they often do not get when attending a Scottish Premiership game.  \"There is less stigma surrounding the women\u0027s game,\" she said. \"That\u0027s why there are a lot of kids that like to go and watch women\u0027s football.\"  Chris Rawlings, Scottish FA\u0027s commercial director said in announcing the BBC Alba deal: \u0026ldquoThis is a partnership we are extremely excited about as the women\u0026rsquos and girls\u0026rsquo game in Scotland continues to develop.  \u0026ldquoHaving a guaranteed broadcast partner allows us to show all the women\u0026rsquos national team home matches which have proven to be an exciting entity.  \u0026ldquoThe record crowd of 4,098 at The Simple Digital Arena in Paisley proves the appetite is there to watch the women\u0026rsquos national team and this deal enables the nation to watch our games, when they can\u0026rsquot make it along to the stadium.\""},{"url":null,"title":"moscow-accuses-uk-of-manipulating-information-after-salisbury-suspects-named-as-russian-spies","story":"  Police and prosecutors said they now had enough evidence to charge Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.  In a hushed Commons chamber, the Prime Minister told MPs investigations had concluded the two men suspected of the \u0026ldquobarbaric attack in March were members of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence service.  \"It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state,\" she declared.  While Mrs May did not explicitly blame the Kremlin for authorising the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal, 67, a former GRU agent, and his daughter Yulia, Tory backbencher Tom Tugendhat said there was \"no doubt it was state ordered and President Putin bears responsibility for a war-like act\".  His Conservative colleague, Dominic Grieve, the former Attorney General, said Britain had become the \u0026ldquovictim of state terrorism by a state, that is run as a gangster organisation.  But Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for Russia\u0026rsquos Foreign Ministry, hit back, claiming the names and photographs of the two suspects \u0026ldquorevealed nothing.  She added: \u0026ldquoOnce again, we ask the British to move from public accusations and manipulating information to practical co-operation via the law enforcement agencies.  In her Commons statement, the PM went through the itinerary of Petrov and Boshirov in the run-up to and in the aftermath of the Salisbury attack, all of which was caught on CCTV cameras.  There was a clear intake of breath in the chamber when she mentioned that traces of the nerve agent Novichok were found in the London hotel room used by the two suspects.  Mrs May told MPs that prosecutors deemed it futile to apply to Moscow for the extradition of the two men as Russia did not allow its citizens to be tried abroad.  But she noted: \u0026ldquoShould either of these individuals ever again travel outside Russia, we will take every possible step to detain them, to extradite them and to bring them to face justice here in the United Kingdom.  A European Arrest Warrant has been obtained and the UK authorities are also seeking the assistance of Interpol.

It comes as independent forecasters revealed income tax raised \u0026pound550 million less than expected last year, with opposition figures urging the SNP to rethink its \u0026ldquohigh-tax agenda.  Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay announced a consultation on plans to create a Scottish National Investment Bank to boost the economy by investing in businesses that would otherwise struggle.  A new report by the David Hume Institute said there had been \"no progress\" towards a target set by ministers in 2007 to improve Scotland\u0027s productivity rankings to take it into the top-performing 25% of nations in the OECD.  It raised concerns over a lack of employment growth in Scotland\u0026rsquos most productive industries, as well as low business investment and a shrinking working-age population.  Arguing there has been little productivity growth over the last 15 years, it also pointed to slipping standards in schools and underlined the importance of \"first-rate education and training\".  It warned there are \"no quick policy fixes to Scotland\u0027s productivity challenge\".  Researchers said nations which had successfully boosted this key part of economic performance had done so only after a \"concerted effort to get their act together\".  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the findings laid bare \u0026ldquothe scale of the SNP\u0026rsquos mismanagement of our economy.  The Wealth of the Nation report \u0026ndash produced with support from the Scottish Policy Foundation, which counts former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson among its advisers \u0026ndash said Scotland is being outperformed by at least half of the OECD.  It also said that while the UK as a whole was \"at the centre of a so-called \u0027productivity puzzle\u0027\" which had seen growth slump to \"virtually zero\", the slowdown had started earlier in Scotland.  It said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos productivity over the past fifteen years has remained broadly stagnant and has underperformed compared with many other European countries.  \u0026ldquoWhile Scotland is more productive than most other regions of the UK, this comparison is limited as the UK as a whole has lower productivity than many other advanced economies.  Among UK regions, Scotland is behind only London and the South East for productivity.  Jane-Frances Kelly, director of the David Hume Institute, insisted \u0026ldquopoliticians and policymakers need to get their act together and make choices guided by evidence.  She added: \u0026ldquoFailing to do this will put the Scottish economy at risk.  It comes as the independent Scottish Fiscal Commission said income tax receipts in Scotland were \u0026pound550 million lower than forecast in 2016/17.  The shortfall was largely down to officials overestimating how many people would pay the highest tax rates, it said.  More than a million Scots pay higher income tax than those earning the same elsewhere in the UK under changes ushered through earlier this year.  Scottish Tory shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the analysis shows \u0026ldquothere are considerably fewer earners on higher and additional rates than the SNP government thought when it was plotting its tax hike.  He added: \u0026ldquoThat means future tax receipts could be badly out, and that will have an impact on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos ability to pay for hospitals schools and infrastructure.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman stressed the shortfall would have \u0026ldquoabsolutely no impact on the Scottish budget or planned spending.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Fiscal Commission forecast the 2016-17 figure based on HMRC survey evidence of the number of Scottish taxpayers.  \u0026ldquoIt was always to be expected that this forecast would differ from outturn data and is why the Scottish budget is protected from any such change.  SNP public finance minister Kate Forbes argued Scotland\u0026rsquos economy is \u0026ldquofundamentally strong, but said the Government will consider the points raised in the David Hume report.  She said: \u0026ldquoOver the last decade, productivity in Scotland has grown at more than three times the rate it has across the UK as a whole, and our productivity growth has been higher than any other country or region of the UK, including London, with productivity increasing by 1.7% in the first quarter of this year.\"  Outlining her legislative programme earlier this week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Scottish National Investment Bank would be established by 2020.  The Government has committed to providing \u0026pound2 billion over 10 years to fund the publicly-owned bank, which will operate on a commercial basis.  It is thought it will require between 100 and 150 staff, with its annual operation costs pegged at between \u0026pound20 million and \u0026pound30 million."},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-says-self-interested-alex-salmond-must-end-appalling-rt-deal","story":"  It was clear the former First Minister\u0026rsquos one guide principle was \u0026ldquoself, he said.  The Scottish Secretary also criticised the former First Minister\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoextraordinary crowdfunded legal action against the Scottish Government over two sexual misconduct complaints.  Mr Salmond raised \u0026pound100,000 in an online appeal within three days to pay for a judicial review at the Court of Session, to challenge the government\u0026rsquos handling of the process.

Speaking to the media at Holyrood between evidence sessions at two committees, Mr Mundell was asked about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos work for the pro-Putin channel RT.  In the days after the Novichok nerve agent attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March, Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos RT show gave a platform to speakers deflecting blame from the Russian state.  On Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs the poisoning had been carried out by two members of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU  Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoI think Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos approach to Russian television has been appalling from the start. It was ill-advised.  \u0026ldquoIt certainly didn\u0026rsquot put the interests of Scotland or the United Kingdom to the fore.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos become increasingly clear that Mr Salmond has one guiding principle in his actions, and that\u0026rsquos self.  \u0026ldquoI think he would do Scotland, himself and the whole country a great service if he were to end his programme on Russian TV.  Asked about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos crowdfunded legal action, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoEvery member of the public that I\u0026rsquove spoken to about that issue found it extraordinary that he would take that decision to seek funding from others for a matter that related primarily to himself.  He echoed the recent comments of Rape Crisis Scotland and Zero Tolerance that Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos \u0026pound100,000 appeal could have a wider chilling effect on women being abused.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe problem is that we want people to come forward to challenge figures in authority, figures of power and wealth, and it\u0026rsquos not helpful for them to create a backdrop where people think that those people can bring huge resources to bear to make their case, whilst an ordinary person is not able to do the same.  Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos comments add the pressure on Mr Salmond to quit RT, which he joined last November for a reported \u0026pound250,000 a year.  The Scottish LibDems also urged Mr salmond to quit this week, however he has so far refused to comment on the matter.  His weekly Alex Salmond Show did not address the Salisbury case this morning.

He went on: \"We did it successfully for rather a long time before our friends on the continent got round to the idea [of establishing the EU].  \"We have constantly over the centuries had to come to their rescue against dictatorships which have sprung up on the continent. This is another case of a dictatorship springing up on the continent from which we have to break free,\" declared the former Conservative Chairman.  Lord Callanan, the Brexit Minister, noted: \"I\u0027m delighted to see that in your advancing age, you have lost none of your robustness. I\u0027m not sure I quite share your sentiments exactly. But of course we are committed to Brexit.  \"We want to be a nation that\u0027s, in future, in charge of our own laws, our own borders and our own money. That\u0027s what Brexit is all about. That\u0027s what people voted for and we will deliver,\" he added.  In a separate development, Matt Hancock, the UK Health and Social Care Secretary, said the flow of medicines to UK patients would be \"unhindered\" by a no-deal Brexit with plans to stockpile drugs and fly in supplies of treatments with short shelf lives.  Mr Hancock insisted he was \"confident\" that supplies would continue and said he was working with the pharmaceutical industry to cover the extra costs that the emergency measures could bring.  Failure to reach agreement with the EU on medical regulation and trade could cause disruption to supply chains but Mr Hancock said preparations were being made to cope.  He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that he was \"increasingly confident\" a deal with Brussels would be agreed.  But the Secretary of State stressed: \"It is important, as a responsible Government, to make sure we prepare for all eventualities and therefore we have got to be ready for exiting without a deal. Therefore, we have proposed that there is stockpiling of medicines by the pharmaceutical companies, not by the NHS.\"  He described the firms\u0026rsquo response so far had been \"very good\" and added: \"I am confident that if everybody does what they need to do, then we can have an unhindered flow of medicines even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\"  But the Liberal Democrats\u0026rsquo Tom Brake, a supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign, said: \"In just two years, ministers have gone from promising \u0027sunlit uplands\u0027 to admitting that taxpayers may have to foot the bill for stockpiling vital medical supplies. And we haven\u0027t even left yet what nasties are there that they haven\u0027t even spotted yet?  He added: \"This dystopian Brexit Britain is not what anyone voted for in 2016. People wanted a stronger NHS, not a health service on its knees, at risk of running out of medicine, equipment and staff.  \"With the Brexit being delivered now unrecognisable from the one that was promised it\u0027s no wonder that calls are growing for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal.\"  Elsewhere, Andrea Leadsom, the Commons Leader, said UK ministers had \"no plan\" to cancel holiday time for MPs to cope with the Brexit workload.  She sought to play down talk of scrapping recesses despite the need to deal with several pieces of law connected to the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019.  Mrs Leadsom also refused to be drawn on suggestions that the Budget could be delayed until December.  Next week, MPs will debate legislating for the withdrawal agreement, proxy voting and the Salisbury nerve agent attack.  Labour\u0026rsquos Valerie Vaz described the business in the chamber as \"light\" and bemoaned a lack of details on what would be debated next month after the party conference recess.  The Shadow Commons Leader told Mrs Leadsom: \"I don\u0027t know if she heard [Solicitor General Robert Buckland] on August 5 on Westminster Hour he said there\u0027s a fair amount of legislation to get through that we\u0027d have to look at recesses.\"  Ms Vaz asked: \"Could the Leader indicate whether the Government is looking at the possible cancellation of recesses and, if so, which ones because we do need to plan.\"  The Labour frontbencher also warned there was \"chaos\" in the Government, and the whole country is \"dissatisfied\" over its handling of Brexit.  She added: \"Chaos, because we\u0027re now told the Budget may be at a different time. Could the leader confirm reports whether the Budget will be in October or whether, as some Treasury sources have indicated, it will be in December?\"  Mrs Leadsom replied: \"There is no plan to cancel recesses.  \"The business managers are looking carefully at recesses and we are very much on the front foot in organising, for example, the secondary legislation as well as the passage of primary legislation to make sure that we enable all members to have the right amount of scrutiny time in this place, and at the same time have the opportunity to carry out their constituency work and to have a bit of a break from time to time.\"  The Commons Leader said the European Commission needed to \"take very seriously\" Mrs May\u0027s offer on the future UK-EU trading arrangement, adding: \"What the Chequers proposal also does is to meet the red lines of the European Commission.  She also defended the business schedule in the Commons before saying on the Budget: \"That date will be announced by the Treasury in the usual manner, as it always is.\"  The Commons returned from a near-six-week summer recess on September 4, will rise on September 13 until October 9 for party conferences, and will rise again on November 6 until November 12. The Christmas break begins on December 20 and runs until January 7."},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-rejects-sturgeons-plan-to-devolve-immigration","story":"  CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the time was \u0026ldquonot right, and firms wanted an integrated system for the whole of the UK, not a regional one.  Ms Fairbairn delivered the message ahead of the CBI Annual Dinner in Glasgow on Thursday, which the First Minister is also due to attend as a top table guest.  However Ms Fairbairn did agree with Ms Sturgeon on a No Deal Brexit being a \u0026ldquocatastrophe, and urged businesses leaders to take a stand against it.  She said it would be so damaging it should be \u0026ldquosimply not an option.  However Theresa May and her ministers insist it remains on the table if the Chequers proposal for a soft Brexit is rejected out-of-hand by the other 27 EU nations.  Ms Fairbairn said the CBI, which speaks on behalf of 190,000 businesses employing nearly 7m people, would speak out clearly on the \u0026ldquothe catastrophic risks of a no-deal exit.  She is expected to say in her speech: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos what it would be for Scotland. A catastrophe. \u0026ldquoDelays to just-in-time delivery meaning that Scotland\u0026rsquos food exports would not reach markets in peak condition. Barriers to talent stifling Scotland\u0026rsquos professional services firms.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos status as fintech power put at risk by new regulations on data. No-deal is just not an option. Not for the UK, not for Scotland, and not for the EU.  Ms Sturgeon has previously said if Scotland is taken out the EU single market and customs union by Brexit, immigration should be devolved to help cope with the impact on EU citizens and workforce shortfalls.  But on immigration, Ms Fairbairn said: \u0026ldquoScotland has a brilliant and talented workforce. But look at the stats, and it\u0026rsquos also a shrinking workforce. Demographics are not in Scotland\u0026rsquos favour.  \u0026ldquoAdd Brexit uncertainty and a brain-drain to the South East and overseas. And you have a potent mix of problems. The skills shortages are biting. Not in the future, not soon. Right now. So last month the CBI called for a new immigration system. A system that earns public trust while allowing business to attract the people they need.  \u0026ldquoA system that\u0026rsquos open but controlled, too. And we are clear it must work for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoSome have asked - do we need a devolved solution for Scotland? It\u0026rsquos a fair question.  \u0026ldquoBut the businesses I\u0026rsquove spoken to say \u0026ldquonot right now. Let\u0026rsquos get it right for the whole UK.  \u0026ldquoThe better the outcome we get, the less need for iation across the UK.  And the less companies need worry about doubled up systems and extra red tape.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who will also be attending the dinner, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom absolutely clear there are no plans to devolve immigration.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot part of the Smith Commission [on more powers], and indeed polling in Scotland suggests the public don\u0026rsquot support the devolving of administration.  He said the UK government\u0026rsquos announcement today of a pilot scheme for 2500 extra visas for seasonal agricultural workers showed iation was possible within the UK.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos official spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are clear that there is a weight of evidence that Scotland should be in control of its own immigration policy.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen today a fairly timid move by the UK Government in terms of seasonal workers for the fruit picking sector.  \u0026ldquoI think 2,500 visas for people UK wide doesn\u0027t even begin to address the issue facing the UK as whole far less properly address the issues facing Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-ministers-refuse-to-publish-their-no-deal-brexit-plans","story":"  Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell told MSPs he didn\u0026rsquot want to add to public \u0026ldquouncertainty and panic despite routinely saying no deal would be a disaster.

It also shows the numbers that say they are Roman Catholic has dipped slightly from 13%, 15 years ago to 12% last year.  But those who say they have no religion has shot up from 43% in 2003 to 56% in 2017.  Ian Montagu, senior researcher at the Scottish Centre for Social Research, said: \"This year\u0026rsquos figures reinforce a gradual picture of overall decline in religious identity in Scotland \u0026ndash a decline most keenly felt by the Kirk.\"  He said the four per cent of people aged 18-34 identifying with the Church of Scotland is \"particularly low\". In 2002 it was 14%.  Mr Montagu added: \u0026ldquoAs attitudes in Scotland become more socially liberal on issues like same sex relationships and abortion, church leaders will no doubt be considering how to better connect to a changing society.  \"It will be interesting to see what impact liberalising measures, such as the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos efforts to allow ministers to conduct same-sex marriages, have upon these numbers in the future.  In June, the largest Protestant church in Northern Ireland voted to sever ties with the Church of Scotland due to what it felt was the Kirk\u0027s more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.    The unprecedented move by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland means the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will no longer be invited to the annual meeting of the church\u0027s General Assembly in Belfast. And the PCI will no longer accept invitations.  Survey data also reveals that in 2009, over one in three said they had attended a Church of Scotland at least once a month, but in 2017 it had dropped to one in four, according to the survey. Those who went to a Catholic church at least once a month dipped from 60% nine years ago to 52% last year.

She added: Our view is that we endeavour to be a Christian presence in communities and a force for good and we will continue to focus on that.  \u0026ldquoJesus called every Christian to be faithful to God and to make a positive difference in the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is why throughout history you have found Christians fighting injustice and inequality, being a voice for the poor and standing up for those who otherwise were alone.  \u0026ldquoJesus called this being a light in the darkness.  \u0026ldquoThe Church of Scotland is there to celebrate with individuals and families in the happy times but also to provide support during the difficult and sad times.  \u0026ldquoIrrespective of the Church\u0026rsquos popularity, that calling remains the same and is why today you still find Christians active at all levels of society.  \u0026ldquoWhether we are many or we are few, the church will always seek to be a force for good in society.\"  The Church of Scotland backed a report in May which could lead to same-sex marriages in church.

Party sources have told The Herald that there is a growing expectation that the deputy leader Jo Swinson, 38, will take Sir Vince\u0026rsquos place within 12 months, barring a snap poll in the wake of Brexit.  Already talk of introducing a Canadian-style plan to open up the leadership to a non-MP appears to have rapidly quietened. One senior party figure branded the proposal \u0026ldquobonkers.  In the speech, at the National Liberal Club in London, Sir Vince will propose the supporters\u0026rsquo scheme to get what were described as \u0026ldquomoderate, liberal-minded voters involved in campaigns such as opposing Brexit.  He will explain that the proposal would mean the new class of supporters would pay nothing to sign up to the party\u0026rsquos values yet enjoy a range of entitlements, including the right to vote for the leadership and to shape the party\u0026rsquos campaigning online.  \u0026ldquoThe Liberal Democrats already have an army of voluntary helpers and deliverers, as well as 200,000 online supporters, who loosely identify with us and campaign with us but, currently, have no say in the direction of the party.  \u0026ldquoWhatever rights our new supporters gain, we as a party aim to be in constant conversation with them, engaging them in campaigns and urging them to begin campaigns of their own. I want these not to be just about stopping things but about growing support for the things that matter to Liberal Democrat voters and to the vast swathe of voters in the centre ground whom we are yet to persuade, Sir Vince is due to say.  He will note that groups like More United, 38 Degrees, Avaaz and Change.org have shown how such regular conversations can happen and help engage hundreds of thousands of people online.  \u0026ldquoI want our party to do that and to offer our movement a political arm within Parliament. So it is not just a protest group banging at the door but a movement with a voice on the inside our parliamentary party.  The party leader will add: \u0026ldquoThe Liberal Democrats are not a socialist party concerned with extreme-left entryism or a right-wing party trying to keep out extreme right-wingers.

But would Press pass muster with those in the trade? More importantly, would it interest those viewers who left papers for the internet years ago? The short answers are no, not really, and maybe, if Bartlett turns the gas up on the drama and eases off on the pondering.  Press is about as true to real newspapers as the sex and revenge drama Doctor Foster was to the life of an average GP.  Among the Acorn Antiques-level bloopers were journalists who typed like YouTube cats, slapping away on their keyboards, unnaturally tidy kitchens, and staffing levels last seen in 1952. At one point an exasperated hack told a contact: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom one of only three investigative reporters left at my paper.  That noise battering the window was a nation\u0026rsquos journalists guffawing as one. Three investigative reporters? Lucky you. Most glaringly of all, there was hardly any ******* swearing.  Bartlett didn\u0026rsquot show much imagination in the stories covered, which were the usual rag bag of Cabinet minister being caught out doing things they should not, MI5 skullduggery, etc, and he reached for the broad brush when it came to the characters: the cocky tabloid editor, the maverick reporter.  The show was saved by the quality of the cast, and the trail of appetising breadcrumbs Bartlett left behind after the first of six episodes. Ben Chaplin, last seen being a very naughty boy in Apple Tree Yard, is terrifically watchable as ego-on-legs editor Duncan Allen, while Charlotte Riley  convinces as the dour deputy news editor who looks like she\u0026rsquos carrying the weight of the world in her backpack.  The possibility of these opposites attracting is promising. Paapa Essiedu is worth keeping an eye on as the office new start who is not too sure if he is in the right business. Then there is the not inconsiderable matter of Duncan\u0026rsquos tangled private life, which included a tall blonde turning up at his door in the middle of the night who did not look like she was there to deliver pizza or give his kitchen the once over with the Mr Muscle. Which, of course, would never happen. The turning up, that is, not the cleaning.  But drama requires a little oomph the way papers need stories, and if the formula worked for Bartlett in Doctor Foster it could do the same here.  Bring on the first blood on the walls dinner party.  After the BBC\u0026rsquos majestic Planet Earth and the Blue Planet, here is your guide to some of the inhabitants of Planet Press and their real-life counterparts in today\u0026rsquos newspaper jungle.  EDITOR  Fiction: Editor of The Herald is the cool, cerebral Amina Chaudhury , while the Post is helmed by lad-about-town Duncan Allen .  Fact: Editors are the silver-backed gorillas of newspapers, much given to beating chests and swinging through newsrooms looking for someone to pummel. There is rarely a female of the species. Will not work for peanuts but expect staff to do so. Often get together with other silverbacks to compare circulation size.  PROPRIETOR  Fiction: The mysterious George Emmerson, given to having quiet chats with editors in the back of his limo, is played by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame.  Fact: The real kings of the jungle and the powers behind any newspaper throne. Over the years their ranks have included more than a few rogues who made Charles Foster Kane look like Charles Hawtrey. Today, newspapers are more likely to be owned by a multinational firm with shareholders rather than a sole proprietor. Far less fun, but safer for pensions.  NEWS PUP  Fiction: Going on his first \u0026ldquodeath knock, calling at the door of the recently bereaved, is boy reporter Ed Washburn .  Fact: As in fiction, newcomers to the trade should be possessed of the requisite mix of charm and rat-like cunning. In reality, if working on a London paper, Ed would be an ex-public schoolboy whose uncle, the business editor, owns half of Wiltshire.  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER  Fiction: Clark Kent lookalike Al Weaver is James Edwards, investigative reporter.  Fact: A rare and fast disappearing breed. Eccentric sorts who grew up with posters of All The President\u0026rsquos Men on their bedroom walls instead of Kylie in gold shorts, they are the true romantics of the profession, the keepers of the flame, and the only hope for humanity. More importantly, they have the filthiest gossip.  NEWS EDITOR  Fiction: The Post\u0026rsquos news ed is played by Shane Zaza and The Herald\u0026rsquos by Charlotte Riley.  Fact: News editors are the meerkats of the trade, much given to popping up from their desk every five seconds to find a reporter they can dragoon into carrying out the editor\u0026rsquos latest insane idea. Highly excitable. On no account feed after midnight or get wet. See Gremlins for handling instructions. Riley also typifies the kind of hard-working woman in newspapers who is twice as good as the men but paid half as much. Not that she is bitter about it. Goes to boxercise in evenings.  EDITOR\u0026rsquoS SECRETARY  Fiction: So far in Press, viewers have only met Lucy , the long-suffering PA to Duncan Allen.  Fact: Outside of the proprietor, the editor\u0026rsquos secretary is the most powerful person in any newspaper and a real tigress. She, and it is always a she, knows where all the bodies are buried. More importantly, she is usually the only grown-up in the building, spending her days dabbing skint knees with Germolene, drying tears before bedtime and sorting toilet accidents.  COMING SOON  The quietly heroic, working all hours production editor who last saw their family six years ago the features editor, usually female but sometimes the odd metrosexual chap sneaks in, which comes in handy when there is mansplaining to be done and the sports editor, possessor of a mind for stats and a six-pack like Winnie  The Pooh."},{"url":null,"title":"tony-blair-says-moderate-labour-may-have-lost-party-to-jeremy-corbyns-left-for-good","story":"  The former prime minister said Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is now a \"different party\" and he hopes it is not \"lost\".  His comments come after another leading figure of the Blair era, Lord Blunkett, warned that the party is facing \"irrelevance\" unless there is a rethink of the \"Corbyn project\".  Mr Blair told the BBC: \"I\u0027ve been a member of the Labour Party for over 40 years. You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it\u0027s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?\"  \"This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don\u0027t know.\"  The former PM\u0027s comments come after Labour activists in Enfield North passed a vote of no confidence in Joan Ryan, a minister in the Blair administration who now chairs Labour Friends of Israel.  Ms Ryan, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn\u0027s handling of anti-Semitism, blamed the 94-92 defeat on \"Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left\".  Writing on Twitter following the vote, she said: \"So lost 92 to 94 votes hardly decisive victory and it never occurred to me that Trots Stalinists Communists and assorted hard left would gave confidence in me. I have none in them.  \"I will be out tomorrow morning working hard for the people of Enfield. Just to be clear I will not be resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.\"  Another former minister in Mr Blair\u0027s government, Frank Field, resigned the party whip after losing a vote of no confidence in his constituency, blaming the anti-Semitism row and allegations of bullying among members.  Another Corbyn critic, Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, also lost a no confidence vote of local activists on Thursday evening.  In a message to constituents, he said: \"It\u0027s not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South.  \"I\u0027m really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today\u0027s Labour Party.  \"I\u0027ve not changed, but the Labour Party has.\"  Mr Blair said: \"There\u0027s lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party\u0027s lost, that the game\u0027s over. I\u0027m kind of hoping they\u0027re not right.\"  The former PM said the row over anti-Semitism that has engulfed the party is \"ghastly\" and a \"matter of great sadness\".  He said he could not have imagined the row taking place in the way it did \"in the Labour Party I joined, all the way through to this moment\".  \"I can\u0027t imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,\" he said.  A Labour Party spokesman said: \"Labour is giving a voice and hope to communities that have been held back and ignored for years.  \"Our policies to end austerity and bring water, energy and rail into public ownership are popular and reflect the mainstream of public opinion.  \"At last year\u0027s election, when all the pundits and critics had written us off, Labour had our biggest increase in vote share since 1945 and deprived Theresa May\u0027s Tories of their majority.\"  Lord Blunkett - a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair\u0027s administration - said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.  Asked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn\u0027t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-defies-westminster-leader-over-kremlin-tv","story":"  Angus Brendan MacNeil, a member of Westminster\u0026rsquos joint committee on national security strategy, also appeared to question if Russia was behind the Novichok attack in Salisbury.  Theresa May told MPs on Wednesday that two members of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, used the rare nerve agent to poison Sergei and Julia Skripal in March.  The new evidence led to calls for Mr Salmond to end his weekly show on RT, which is forced to register in the United States as an arm of the Putin regime.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said this week that RT was a \u0026ldquovehicle of the Russian state and advised people not to lend it credibility by appearing on it.  He said: \"I certainly wouldn\u0027t encourage people to be seen on RT. I\u0027ve made it clear that I don\u0027t believe that people should broadcast on RT.  \u0026ldquoI think RT is a vehicle of the Russian state. People need to know exactly what the Russian state are doing, and by extension, RT are part of that.\"  Mr MacNeil, who has appeared on RT several times, including on Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos show, made it clear he would not be heeding his group leader\u0026rsquos warning.  Asked if he was reconsidering his appearances on RT, he told BBC Radio Scotland: \u0026ldquoNo. I think I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media. Many people have issues with the BBC. I\u0026rsquom talking to the BBC just now. And I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media at all if it\u0026rsquos possible.  He was asked if he would appear even if there was clear evidence RT was a tool of the Russian state, as Mr Blackford said, and Russian authorities had poisoned people in the UK.

The event will bring together business leaders, social enterprises and housing and environmental experts to take a fresh look at how companies can make a difference.  It will also see the launch of a tool to help firmsmeasure their value to society \u0026ndash whether that is through inclusion and equality, employment and training, or sustainable growth.  Participants include Josh Littlejohn, the founder and chief executive of Social Bite, a company built on the goal of improving society, firstly by providing homeless people with jobs and now through the Social Bite Village, ensuring they have homes as well.  The event will also hear from Naila Akram, Community Investment Manager at sponsor Balfour Beatty, which is looking at the impact the construction firm makes on local communities, not only through supporting employability and skills but increasingly trying to support small businesses and charities. \u0026ldquoThe area that we could do more in is wider economic growth, supporting SMEs and the 3rd sector as well as the environmental side of social value, such as habitats and biodiversity, she said.  The first such event of its kind in Scotland, the Social Value Portal, which is supported by the Herald, aims to ensure social benefit becomes \u0026ldquobusiness as usual for Scottish firms.  Guy Battle, chief executive of Social Value Portal says advances have been made, with laws in England and Scotland which encourage government to factor in social value when planning public spending.  \u0026ldquoWith the public sector struggling with the financial burden they are facing businesses really need to step up to the plate, he said. \u0026ldquoSocial value encourages businesses to get involved in delivering services in that space : whether it be community wellbeing, environmental benefit, community businesses or local spend. It encourages businesses to do more than just deliver the contract.  The event at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Dynamic Earth on Friday September 21st will culminate in a social value marketplace where businesses and communities can come together to find matches between what companies can offer and what their communities need."},{"url":null,"title":"children s panel seeks new members","story":"        Young people in Aberdeenshire are being urged to volunteer for the Children\u0026#8217s Panel and help change the lives of thousands of children and young people in Scotland.                Launched across Scotland, the “Force for Good” campaign by Children’s Hearings Scotland , which is responsible for recruiting volunteers to join Scotland’s unique Children’s Panel, aims to encourage more women, men and particularly those aged between 18 and 25 to become Panel Members.                                                    Scotland’s Children’s Panel is made up of 2,500 volunteer Panel Members who give their time to ensure the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable children and young people who may be at risk.                                                    Completely dependent on the time and commitment of these volunteers, CHS is looking to recruit over 500 new Panel Members from all ages, backgrounds and locations across Scotland with a particular focus on attracting more men and young people.        CHS will host an information event at the SCRA offices in Fraserburgh on Tuesday, September 11, at 7pm. The offices can be found at 10 Commerce Street.A second event will be held on Thursday, September 13 at 6pm in Woodhill House, Aberdeen.Boyd McAdam, National Convener of Children’s Hearings Scotland, said: “Children and young people attending hearings have told us that they want to see more diversity among Panel Members. In particular, they’re keen to see more young people to whom they can potentially relate when decisions are being made about their lives.“To ensure we are doing the very best for those who experience the hearings system, we feel it is important to recruit as many young people as possible to volunteer as Panel Members. In addition, this year we are also looking to recruit more men to the Panel and have a national target of around 200.”                                                                                                        Between April 2017 and March 2018, 32,553 children’s hearings took place supporting 14,076 vulnerable children and young people across Scotland at risk of neglect, abuse or who may be involved in the care system.Whilst children and young people can be referred to the Children’s Reporter for a range of different reasons, recently released statistics show that between April 2017 and March 2018, 85% of the cases referred were on the grounds of care and protection. This is the most common ground for referral for children under the age of one.Boyd added: “Panel Members are required to deal with a range of different cases in children’s hearings. These can often be very complex. We are looking for a diverse range of people who can engage with children and young people, make important and difficult decisions and importantly who can ensure that the rights of the child or young person in each hearing are respected.”The new CHS campaign will run for five weeks until the end of September.

They are a force for good and their role is vital.”The Children’s Panel is a system unique to Scotland and last year saw around 1,500 people apply to become members. There are currently 3,000 volunteers across Scotland dedicating around 360,000 hours each year to the Children’s Hearings system.

Aberdeenshire Council will carry out work to form a community park and install play equipment, after the initial developer of the site, Avant Homes, failed to install the facilities as required.                                                     The work had been a condition of the planning permission agreed for the site and late last year the council served planning enforcement notices to try to get the work moving.                                                     Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council’s Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: “Although some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment. As such the Council has appointed contractors to complete the works. “The site owners, Kingseat Community Association, Newmachar Community Council and immediate neighbours to the development area have been formally notified of the start date.                                                                                                        “This is the first element of an attempt to facilitate completion of the wider development at Kingseat and deliver some much-needed community facilities for the residents.”The work is expected to take up to 60 days to complete, depending on weather conditions.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

55-year-old, who lives in north London but originally hails from Indonesia, is on a walk from Lands End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats accompanied by his three shih tzus  and chihuahua .Donkers, who is also an animal healer and massage therapist, is doing the walk to raise awareness and funds to help end \u0026ldquothe barbaric dog-meat trade in south-east Asia.Festivals such as Yulin, celebrate the torture and consumption of dogs.It is thought that inflicting pain such as blow torching, bludgeoning and skinning and boiling them alive, makes their flesh taste more tender, and helps those who eat it cope with hot weather.However, dog-eating festivals represent less than 0.01 per cent of the dog-meat trade as a whole. In China, more than 10 million dogs are killed and eaten every year.Robert, who will have reached Inverness by the time you have picked up your copy of the Groat, said: \u0026ldquoI started campaigning against the dog-meat trade in the far east after seeing a YouTube clip showing the terrible cruelty inflicted on the dogs destined to be eaten.\u0026ldquoAs a child in Indonesia, I would hear about family pets being sold or stolen for meat.\u0026ldquoNow I aim to do all that I can to save dogs from that horrible fate. My organisation, Walking to Save Dogs, raises funds to support carefully selected local shelters and projects that rescue dogs from these Festivals and the meat trade.\u0026ldquoThe ultimate goal is to put an end to the dog-meat trade through education that dogs are sentient beings, changing legislation, and providing dog-meat traders with alternative means to support their families.Robert aims to reach John O\u0026rsquoGroats by September 18, although he has already lost one of his canine companions.He added: \u0026ldquoSadly, Madeleine recently developed an eye problem so has gracefully pawed out.\u0026ldquoShe continues to support the rest of the pack from a comfy armchair at home.\u0026ldquoMy pets are the voice of millions of less fortunate dogs.\u0026ldquoThey have been well-prepared for this task and they love the outdoors.\u0026ldquoWe have been walking 12 miles a day on average and hope to finish our walk within a couple of weeks.\u0026ldquoI am touched beyond words at the kindness and generosity of the Scottish people I have met along the trail and look forward to meeting lots more on the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats.To follow Robert\u0026rsquos progress and to donate, go to: www.walkingtosavedogs or www.justgiving/crowdfunding/walkingtosavedogsFriday 7 Sep 2018 1:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"High success rate for Wick school leavers","story":"WICK High has been praised for how they prepare their pupils for the adult world once they leave school.A report from the director of education, presented by Alison Donald, education quality improvement manager for the north, showed that leavers from the school had made considerable progress with a large number going onto positive destinations.These include universities, higher education colleges and full-time employment.The breakdown of positive destinations showed that54.4 per cent of pupils going on to higher and further Edu-cation in 2014/15 had now increased over two years to 60.6 per cent.On top of that, nearly10 per cent of pupils becoming unemployed either seeking or not seeking employment in 2014/15 had fallen to less than one per cent in 2016/17.Local councillors have welcomed the report\u0026rsquos findings and have praised the school for helping pupils embark on a positive course when they leave.Councillor Raymond Bremner said: \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely fantastic to see that in two years of performance analysis in respect of pupils going on to positive destinations from Wick High School.\u0026ldquoThis surely has to be one of the best improvement increases in the Highlands, if not the country and you cannot help but be extremely proud of this on behalf of the school.\u0026ldquoThe figures detailing the types of destination our pupils from Wick High School are going to are also hugely encouraging.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 7 Sep 2018 1:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Friday 7 Sep 2018 1:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This allows our robust and oily new make spirit to gently mature over an extended period of time, delivering a full-on aromatic peat flavour with a surprisingly sweet finish.In Malt Advocate, John Hansell commented “Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place” and we know exactly what he means. There’s that fudgy sweetness that characterises the more mature Highland Park, but here it’s combined with complex aromatic spices as well as dark chocolate orange and floral peat notes.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartFriday 7 Sep 2018 1:02 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This year, four of his colleagues will saddle up: partner John Smart and personal assistant Adele MacIver from the Inverness office, along with partner David Scott and senior associate Veli-Matti Raikkonen from Aberdeen.Mr Cormack said: \u0026ldquoEven in the midst of planning last year\u0026rsquos cycle, we knew we wanted to bring it back again.\u0026ldquoAnd while this is a social ride \u0026mdash starting and finishing in Avoch and looping round the Black Isle coast \u0026mdash it\u0026rsquos not necessarily an easy one.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

As it meets again in Manchester for its sesquicentennial congress, it is a something of a paradox for the singular peak organisation of organised labour that it now again faces many of the very same challenges it faced 150 years ago.                Now, in short, work is often poorly paid, employment is increasingly insecure, for many there is not enough of it, and employers usually have the whip hand. This means there is the manifest need for union representation but not the corresponding power of unions to right these wrongs in the labour market and wider society.            Signified by the founding meeting being held in the city’s Mechanics’ Institute, when the TUC was established it was largely for union members who were skilled male workers – those that had trades. But not long after, unskilled workers joined unions which became affiliated to the TUC. And, after them, women workers and public sector workers then also joined the union fold in large numbers.            Such were the numbers in the union movement come the 1960s and 1970s that not only were the TUC’s general secretaries household names but prime ministers, Labour and Conservative, feared and respected them in equal measure. This was the era of “beer and sandwiches” where governments, unions and employers sat down together to discuss economic matters. In this era, the TUC was portrayed as a powerful, if slow and plodding, “old cart horse”.The entry of the Conservatives into Downing Street in May 1979 turned out to be a long and painful period for the TUC and its union affiliates. Membership fell by around a half and doors were closed in their faces by government and employers alike. So, the TUC has struggled to regain and maintain its influence. There was no great fillip during the period of Labour governments from 1997 to 2010. Unions were regarded as unwelcome relatives at a family party even though they sought3 to engage in partnership with employers and widen their bargaining agenda to include skills and training. Despite the age of austerity since the 2007-2008 financial crash and a new younger and woman leader since 2013, the TUC has struggled to play the role in aggregating and mobilising the patent discontent that exists amongst workers and their families as income inequality has continued to grow. Food banks have replaced alms houses while zero-hour contracts are like a modern form of day labouring. The TUC missed the opportunity to forge an alliance between the providers of public services – at least those who are public sector union members – with the users of those services.READ MORE: Brian Monteith: Venezuela offers brutal warning over Corbyn’s LabourThe problems that the TUC and unions today face are three-fold in terms of their renewal and revitalisation. First, unions are still wrongly portrayed by the media and many politicians as generators of conflict so there is hostility. Second, many workers do not know what a union stands for and does, so there is ignorance. And third, many workers think unions are now too weak to help them so there is a perception of powerlessness.There are obvious solutions to these issues in terms of education, media work and becoming more assertive. Each solution has implications for resources – with more resources, the TUC could do more on each of these fronts but currently it is restricted in what it can do.            There is one possible way it could help square the circle though. This is through specifically targeting recruitment of younger workers. In the late 1990s, the TUC led the way by getting its affiliates to spend more resources on recruitment, retention and organising. It set up an Academy to do so. Today, it is aiming to do something similar with younger workers but with less of a physical approach and more of a virtual one.READ MORE: Richard Leonard makes call for stronger workers’ rightsUnionisation rates for younger workers are pitifully low – at less than 10 per cent for 16 to 24-year-olds. Amongst older workers, density is the highest at 30 per cent for those 50 and over. This presents the TUC with an existential crisis – in a generation of two, unions could face literal extinction. The TUC is leading the campaign to convince its affiliates to talk to young workers in a medium and a language that is suited to younger workers, rather than the union themselves. So issues will also include rent, mental health, careers and the like and through the array of new social media platforms.            Targeting younger workers using new technology to communicate new issues is not just a case of “motherhood and apple pie”. Momentum within Labour has shown how purposeful activism can be ignited while Labour itself has demonstrated that having the correct message can lead to widespread connection.But alongside this, the TUC and its unions must also do something else. They must be able to show a hundred-fold more that the cases of successful strikes and other collective actions at McDonald’s, Deliveroo, TGI Friday and Uber – involving predominantly younger workers in low-paid, insecure jobs – are not aberrations. So they must win disputes and be seen to win them. Here, some very small unions  and some very large ones  have shown on occasion what can be achieved. If they can do that, the prospect of an upward virtuous spiral of growing membership and power can come into view. The old carthorse could be transformed into an agile young filly. This would mean the TUC is not just the collective voice for workers’ rights but also the collective enforcer for these rights. It would mean helping lead disputes and organising solidarity for those in dispute so that the sense of the time-honoured slogans of “unity is strength” and “an injury to one is an injury to all” would again be meaningful and manifest. Yet none of this will be easy to achieve without a change in government so much depends upon a Corbyn entering 10 Downing Street to help change the external legal and political environments to enable this to happen.Professor Gregor Gall is an affiliate research associate at Glasgow University"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796263.1536262195!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy how to change your life in 40 minutes","story":"        The simple things in life we can take for granted. We can even miss them in an age where technology occupies so much of our time.                 The simple things in life we can take for granted. We can even miss them in an age where technology occupies so much of our time. So, recently I have been getting back to basics. Heck, I even built a small dry stone wall after watching a few ‘how to’ videos. But, bringing it back even further to a pastime that requires no tools, videos or manuals, I want you to re-experience the emotions and thoughts that can fizzle around your mind when you take a walk. Yes, a simple walk. It is truly amazing what you can see when you take the time from your day to put one foot in front of the other and gaze with purpose.            Firstly you need to make a conscious decision to walk on your own. It can be nice and empowering to walk with someone, but you can miss so much as you natter. Being alone with your thoughts as you stride out brings powerful focus on so many things. This is key to a successful, thought-provoking and enjoyable walk.            Next think about how much time you have and want to dedicate to your walk. I would suggest about 40 minutes is a good time, considering how long you can focus for and how beneficial the walk is for your health. Then just head off and walk. No need to jump in a car if you don’t need to. Urban trekking or the bucolic idyll is fine either way.Now that you’re out and about on your walk, it is time to really enjoy it as you stare, scrutinise, interrogate and gaze.READ MORE: New coastal walking trail to open up in scenic southern tip of ScotlandFor ious reasons, we have lost the ability and capacity to focus on the world around us. It is all part and parcel of how technology is killing off human nature. Simply looking at the landscape wherever you are livens up the signals to between your eyes and your brain. From architecture to woodland, there is so much to fathom out. Why did the farmer build a well there? Why did the city fathers use one type of block over another? And so it starts. And you build layer upon layer of questioning and analysis on what is around you. No mobile phones. No listening to music through earbuds. Just utilising and honing your senses.Our sense of sight is a true gift. But, we fail to appreciate what is in front of us a great deal of the time. We see what we need to see. For example, as we navigate around a town or city, we look for the cues that give us pointers like street signs, traffic lights, lane markings, pedestrian crossings. Stop. Go. Turn Left. Wait. And while all this is taking place as we are on autopilot to get to work, to park, to eat, to go home, we have pulled up a metaphysical drawbridge to everything else that exists around us.            Simply by looking up, we can delve into so much more context and history on our walk. Looking up in a city throws up an incredible amount of detail. The complexity of roofing. How the guttering works and drops down on the outside of buildings via pipes deep into the sewer systems. The types of slate that have been laid – everything from Scottish to Spanish – tell a story. Satellite dishes hanging off walls where the phones lines are attached. A whole city exists above the city pavements if you take time to look.READ MORE: Five of the best beach walks in ScotlandConversely on your walk, you can choose to look down instead of straight ahead. Looking down offers an insight into special places that ordinarily one would walk past and miss. In places like Edinburgh there are voluminous garden flats secreted at the side of the pavements. These dwellings run beneath whole tenemented buildings with a dual aspect at the front and back. And as you walk, you can see the stairs leading down to them. It is so easy to miss them. Then you will notice that the pavement you are walking on is above the cavernous store rooms that accompany these garden flats. What a clever use of space by our Victorian city planners. And so it goes on ...Whether you walk straight out and straight back or take a loop, there is always a new sight to pick up on, a new smell to notice.            But, it takes some effort on your behalf. If you have ever tried yoga, then you will understand the energy needed to unthink your current thoughts and focus on your heart beat and get in the moment and in tune with your body.This is exactly what it is like as you forget the rest of what is taking place in your life and focus on your walk. Instead of reflecting on the issues and problems you are facing back home or at work, you are reflecting on the environment around you. And it will throw back observations to you as you question why things are as they are.And then your 40 minutes is up. You arrive back at the house or office with a whole new perspective on life around you. Selfishly, you have re-energised parts of your brain that have been dulled down over time, while benefiting from the exercise you have undertaken with minimal stress and strains on your joints.  You can come back to reality and I guarantee you will feel better in your mind and spirit.

First, do no harm. This advice for those aspiring to become doctors has stood the test of thousands of years for a reason.            Patients must have confidence that when they go to see a doctor they are in safe hands.            And so the grim revelation reported by The Scotsman that a surgical mesh implant had, for the first time, been formally recorded as an underlying cause of a death – that of 75-year-old Eileen Baxter from Loanhead – prompted questions at the highest level yesterday, with calls for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to set up an urgent review.More than 100,000 of women across the UK have been given the implants over the past two decades, but complaints have been growing from patients who have found themselves in permanent pain – sometimes so bad that they are unable to work or even walk.READ MORE: Mesh implant listed as ‘cause of death’ for first timeUse of the implants, designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence, is currently suspended by NHS Scotland, although they can still be used in some cases. Sturgeon told Holyrood that in the six months to March the procedure had been carried out 33 times, compared to more than 11,000 times in the same period of 2013/14. She also pledged to give calls for a review “careful consideration”.            The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is responsible for deciding which medical devices can be used by the NHS, so it may be the appropriate body to re-examine the safety of the implants.But if the Scottish Government does not hold its own review, it needs to press the MHRA to do so for the sake of future patients and the thousands who already have mesh implants, who will understandably be extremely worried.There are experts who have argued against a complete ban on mesh implants – such as Scotland’s Chief Medical Office, Dr Catherine Calderwood – on the grounds that there is little or no alternative for some patients.And such views need to be taken seriously. It may be that a problem can occur in specific cases for reasons that are not well enough understood.             If the implants can be used safely to help patients, then they should be.But, given someone has died and there have been numerous accounts of serious, life-changing problems, the medical world needs to establish the facts – and quickly."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796335.1536307099!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon hints at defying parliament on p1 tests","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon has signalled that the Scottish Government would push ahead with controversial testing for primary one pupils even if Holyrood votes against it.

Scottish Secretary David Mundell has warned that a \u0026#8220chaotic Brexit\u0026#8221 could boost support for Scottish independence.                The UK cabinet minister urged the SNP and other opposition parties to get behind Theresa May’s Chequers Deal as the best alternative to a No Deal scenario as he appeared before MSPs at Holyrood.            But he came under fire from Nationalist MSPs who told him Mrs May’s plan for the UK’s departure fro the EU, which would include a “common rulebook” for all goods with the EU and a “combined customs territory” at borders, was a “dead duck.”.            An poll at the weekend suggested that Brexit would lead to a majority of Scots voting for independence and Mr Mundell accepted this was a concern.“I think we always have to alive to the fact that it’s the driving purpose of the SNP to take forward an independence argument and they’re going to look to do that in any circumstance,” he told ITV’s Representing Border.READ MORE: Business leader to reject Nicola Sturgeon’s call for separate Scottish immigration “A chaotic Brexit in my view might assist them to do that, so therefore we should not aspire to achieve that  – for a whole host of other reasons – there’s economic reasons – but chaos and turbulence is exactly the sorts of environment in which the Nationalists would see that they could take advantage of.” Mr Mundell’s defence of the Chequers deal came in response to reports that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has dismissed the deal as  “dead.”             It has also  deepened Conservative splits  on the issue with Eurosceptics like Jacob Rees Mogg concerned that it gives away too much.Nationalist MSP Willie Coffey criticised Mr Mundell’s position during an appearance before Holyrood’s Constitution committee yesterday.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: Support for Scottish independence is increasing“Mr Mundell, are you seriously asking us to believe that the Chequers proposal isn’t a dead duck – you can’t get it past your own party,” Mr Coffey said            But the Scottish Secretary insisted the Chequers deal is “still live and still on the table”, adding that a “no deal” scenario would not be good for Scotland.“That’s why I don’t want to be in that position of a no deal and if we get to the point that Parliament gets the opportunity to vote for the Chequers deal or a no deal I will be absolutely in the column of those voting for Chequers and I would hope that the labour party and the SNP, if they genuinely don’t want a no deal, will be doing likewise.”    "},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

The insulation and boiler scrappage schemes that local partners have lobbied for, and secured, have also had a positive impact.\nFuel poverty is measured as a percentage of household income so increasing wages can also help.

Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nFriday 7 Sep 2018 1:02 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8626082.1536224983!/image/image.jpg","title":"family ask for prayers after young cameron truesdale passes away","story":"\nBrave Cameron Truesdale , who was battling a highly aggressive brain tumour, has sadly passed away.\n\n                \nA family statement said this morning: “Wednesday evening a piece of our heart was taken and carried to heaven.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Cameron passed away surrounded by his family.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“He fought with all his might for 20 months after we where given nine months.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

as well as using the Shankill Leisure Centre as the filming schedule continues.\nSchool Principal John Martin said he was very impressed with the attention to detail the film crew put in to recreating the particular period of history.\n“The crew work so quickly to recreate the time and place,” he said. “We have had some of the corridors repainted, signage put up and some of our music rooms have been transformed to look like the Olympic Village were the skaters stayed – complete with itineraries on the walls and training timetables.\n“We are delighted that St Mary’s was chosen for the film project and look forward to seeing the school on the big screen.”\nFilming is continuing on the film with a release date expected in the autumn.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37291780.ece/f56b4/AUTOCROP/w620/primark_exclusion_zone_map.jpg","title":"belfast city centre may lose 20m in the runup","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It definitely can be done economically. \n\n\"There is concern about the cost of the project, but you know what they say you can have three economists you’d have four conclusions.  \n\n\"There are opinions either way about whether it can stack up or not.\"\n\nAt the conference Professor Dunlop also released the first artist impression of what the bridge might look like. \n\n\n\n\nWhy £15bn bridge to Scotland could be the answer to Brexit conundrum\n\n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\n\n\n\nThe catalyst for the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland came from a speech made by Boris Johnson in January 2018 while he was the Foreign Secretary, in which he floated the idea of a 22-mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit. \n\nProfessor Dunlop said the proposal wasn\u0027t feasible as the stretch between the United Kingdom and France is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, but was asked shortly afterwards by Scottish newspaper The National if a similar project between Scotland and Northern Ireland was a possibility. \n\nHe laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrick  or a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .\n\n\"One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was £600 each time. So when you take personalised stories like this you can see how the financial benefit would add up,\" Professor Dunlop said. \n\nThe proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would \"initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity\" between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important \"that all options are fully considered\" \n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project.  \n\nThe idea was also supported by former Foreign Secretary, who has called for it to be considered \"seriously\".  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan bell i was not told about spike in applications for rhi scheme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37291780.ece/f56b4/AUTOCROP/w620/primark_exclusion_zone_map.jpg","title":"small firms feeling pinch after blaze call for facade of primark to be torn down","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It was part of InShops, where Lidl now operates on High Street, for 12 years.\n\nIt was revealed yesterday that around 1,000 people were employed by businesses that are currently unable to trade.\n\nMs McGovern said action needed to be taken as soon as possible.\n\n\"We\u0027ve had a substantial loss that a small independent retailer cannot cushion,\" she added.\n\nThe store has been in its current location beside Primark for 15 years.\n\nAsked if efforts should be made to save the remaining structure, Ms McGovern said: \"If it means that the junction is closed for four months, bring it down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exclusion zone around Primark\u0027s Bank Buildings. Graphic Raymond Esteban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I love the building and I always have, but it\u0027s a building, at the end of the day. This is about people\u0027s livelihoods.\n\n\"I have a 27-year-old business that could be put under because of a building, not to mention all the other businesses in the area.\"\n\nMs McGovern said businesses were told by Belfast City Council on Wednesday that footfall in the city centre was down by 45%.\n\n\"It\u0027s not just us inside the cordon and it\u0027s not just the guys on the edge of the cordon who are in a virtual cul-de-sac, it\u0027s the whole city, and the council don\u0027t seem to have grasped the urgency,\" she said.\n\nThe owner of Argento, another of the 14 businesses closed, said Bank Buildings should be demolished. Peter Boyle claimed a decision regarding keeping the facade should be made within the next three weeks.\n\n\"We\u0027ve lost a week of turnover and December represents 30% of our income,\" Mr Boyle added.\n\n\"If it can\u0027t be saved before the end of September, it should be demolished. For 10 days, not a thing has been done.\n\n\"We were told at a meeting that people were working 24/7 to try and save that building.\"\n\nCity Picnic owner Arthur McAnerney said he objected to knocking Bank Buildings down and was looking at the possibility of relocating.

tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/freederrycorner.jpg","title":"trust apologises after pink free derry wall for organ donor

It would be hilarious but for the money involved and the questions it raises about competence, cronyism and ethical behaviour at the highest levels of government. \n\nWe had allegations that former minister Jonathan Bell had tried to break his spad\u0027s finger and swung a punch at him. We heard that his former spad Timothy Cairns told him \"Listen to me, big b***s\" during a row witnessed by senior civil servants. \n\nThere were lurid suggestions of sexual misconduct made about two of Mr Bell\u0027s ministerial colleagues. \n\nThere was evidence that Mr Bell was unable to adequately discharge his duties the morning after a late night in New York. \n\nThere were claims that Mr Cairns answered to other spads rather than his ministerial boss and that some of them had families who stood to gain from RHI. \n\nAll this, before we even consider Mr Bell alleging that the Executive\u0027s spin doctor David Gordon characterised him as a \"monster\" who needed to be put to sleep and that a senior journalist was advising the DUP about how to attack him. \n\nThe former permanent secretary of his department stated that colleagues at Invest NI had complained of Minister Bell\u0027s \"limited contribution to Northern Ireland\u0027s interests regarding foreign direct investment and trade\" and the risk of him \"making inappropriate or unhelpful comments\".\n\nAfter a trade delegation he was due to lead to the US on St Patrick\u0027s Day was dropped, it was further stated that he delayed providing routine information to OfM/DfM and travel authorisation for Invest NI staff out of pique. \n\nMost of those settling in to watch the live feed were expecting to hear a Northern Irish version of Yes Minister. What they got sounded more like a particularly fractious episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show with the DUP family at war. \n\nDuring the hearing it appeared that Mr Bell\u0027s memory of key events and grasp of detail is far from perfect, that he made secret recordings of conversations with civil servants and party colleagues, and that spads rather than he made key decisions. \n\nRegardless of the veracity of any of the claims, the rest of us are left wondering about the ethics and integrity of those who govern us. \n\nSadly, the civil service does not emerge well either. \n\nThe people running the RHI scheme appeared not to be able to spot basic flaws. The unit was under-resourced, no staff had specialist knowledge of a complex field and personnel changes meant that there was no continuity as the crisis unfolded. \n\nMost people will be shocked and bewildered by all of this. Of course, the media can distort and sensationalise stories. But this one gets worse if you follow the live coverage and read all the documents. \n\nWe have no government. But if and when we do, there is no case for dancing in the streets. \n\nCivil servants and ministers will have much to prove. We need to trust that civil servants have the competence to manage large budgets, ministers the ability to lead them, and that unelected party officials are controlled by ministers, not the other way around. Until that confidence is restored, providing Stormont with yet more power would be unthinkable. \n\nNick Garbutt runs Nick Garbutt PR\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37291527.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_QUB_46-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"arlene foster status quo for investigating past is totally unacceptable","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There is a clear distinction in law between a terrorist perpetrator and their innocent victim, and to equate the two is morally untenable. A perpetrator of an unlawful act cannot at the same time be a victim of the act they have perpetrated.\n\nExtremely powerful testimony at our meetings and discussions further reinforced the depth and rawness of hurt and insult victims\u0027 families feel at their loved one being placed in the same category as terrorist perpetrators.\n\nThe DUP has previously tabled legislative proposals to change the definition of a victim. \n\nThe Government should bring forward plans now for a new UK-wide definition of a victim with a clear distinction between perpetrator and victim. We believe this could improve the existing climate and context and offer the best prospect of new legacy bodies proving successful.\n\nIt is important we tackle the ever-growing promotion of a state vs non-state tale of the \u0027Troubles\u0027 which ignores that the overwhelming view of all sections of the community, including governments, politics, civil society and churches, was that the violence was morally unacceptable.\n\nSetting the terrorist campaigns in proper context is essential. One way to assist in this could be through the Government taking forward the development of an authoritative, evidence-based account of the period. This is an area in which my DUP colleagues and I have been carrying out some work over recent months, and will consult more widely on shortly.\n\nThe current definition of a victim and past government actions are overshadowing progress made in the Stormont House talks, such as establishing in law a credible definition of collusion and unburdening the Police Ombudsman\u0027s Office of its legacy role, as well as the DUP\u0027s key objective of securing full criminal investigations for all outstanding cases.\n\nThe status quo for investigating the past is totally unacceptable. There is a disproportionate focus on the activities of the armed forces and police. This includes the work of the Legacy Investigation Branch of the PSNI, the ious ongoing inquiries, the Police Ombudsman, the Public Prosecution Service and the so-called legacy inquests.\n\nWhile little progress has been made in bringing to justice the terrorist organisations responsible for 90% of the deaths, hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u0027 money and innumerable hours of police time have been devoted to pursuing investigations against veterans of our armed forces and retired police officers.\n\nThe PSNI Legacy Investigation Branch devotes a wholly disproportionate level of its resources to investigating the small number of killings linked to the security forces and an inadequate amount to the thousands of unsolved terrorist murders.\n\nThe status quo is not an option. As things currently stand, innocent victims are the only group not seeing some level of progress on investigations.\n\nArlene Foster is a former First Minister and leader of the DUP\n"},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley admits she couldnt fathom northern ireland voters","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

now Secretary of State for Communities - stepped aside for medical reasons.\n\nShe continued: \"That\u0027s a very different world from the world I came from, where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative.\n\n\"That is so incredibly different and it\u0027s when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.\"\n\nShe was speaking in an interview with the weekly magazine for the Houses of Parliament.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"secretary of states announcement of civil servant decisions is of greater significance","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They\u0027ll soon be receiving a mere 25% more than the average UK salary for not turning up for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nKaren Bradley\u0027s belated adoption of the Reaney proposals for salary reduction offered an overdue response to farce.\n\nIt was also a minimal response - and one which simply ignored legislation which requires her to call an Assembly election. Such a contest would of course be pointless and possibly counter-productive - but it is the correct legal position, one usurped at ministerial whim. Of much greater significance than the cash crowd-pleaser was the Secretary of State\u0027s announcement of legislation to allow civil servants to take the decisions MLAs ought to be making.\n\nIndirect rule.\n\nIf I was a civil servant I\u0027d be asking for a cut of the £13,000 being taken from one of those poor MLAs. Civil servants will soon be effectively moonlighting as Executive ministers. And we all thought double-jobbing had ended.\n\nBradley\u0027s actions are an obvious attempt to keep Stormont open as a bit more than a tourist attraction.\n\nAllowing civil servants to make decisions avoids the dreaded direct rule label. It keeps alive the possibility of a return to devolved government until there really does have to be an election, in 2022. \n\nAnd even then, we could have a fantasy election to an Assembly that doesn\u0027t exist: 2003 all over again. Rule by civil service decree is profoundly undemocratic. Those elected by no-one will be making important decisions that affect everyone.\n\nGovernance transfers to the unelected and unaccountable. The main means of citizen redress will be via the courts. \u0027First Minister Sterling\u0027 - a job he does not seek and in which he ought not to be placed - will take decisions without democratic mandate.\n\nWhether the quality of civil service rule will improve matters is unclear. A fair chunk of the RHI evidence suggests a body struggling with the complexities of the legislation - even if it ought to have been mainly a cut-and-paste from the Westminster model - and failing to warn hapless ministers as trouble developed.\n\nIn its defence, the civil service appeared short-staffed and overworked - problems now multiplied several-fold by the Secretary of State\u0027s promise of more roles.\n\nThe costs of a full Assembly dissolution would be personal as well as political. When the Assembly was created in 1998-99, it was not the main source of livelihood for many MLAs. Few had expected its formation and many had other jobs.\n\nAfter years of relative stability from 2007-16, it has become the main source of income for most members .\n\nSo sympathy is due to those MLAs who are blameless in the institutional collapse and diligent in their constituency duties. As my Liverpool colleague Sean Haughey has shown in the Journal of Legislative Studies, MLAs spend a big proportion of their work  on constituency activity. \n\nThere\u0027s also much to be said for working from home. But when the university term starts, I wouldn\u0027t get 35p let alone £35K for long if I played truant. And members of a legislative assembly need to be just that.\n\nReducing salaries can concentrate minds but not change them. It may make MLAs thrifty with the weekly shopping but paying people £13,000 less will not alter their views on an Irish Language Act, same-sex marriage, abortion, Brexit, blame for RHI, whatever. \n\nUltimately political will not fiscal rectitude will determine the Assembly\u0027s future. There remains the strong suspicions that the DUP is, for now, comfortable with political arrangements - no worries for the DUP nine, erstwhile 10, given their prospering at Westminster - whilst Northern Ireland\u0027s institutions are not Sinn Fein\u0027s ultimate concern anyway.\n\nLogically, there is no reason why the Assembly cannot be reconstituted to deal with schools, hospitals and other matters, even if its members are still arguing over the dead-end of identity politics and wrestling over social issues. \n\nAn incremental way forward would be for the Assembly to revive but confine legislation initially to agreed ring-fenced issues - baby steps back to the full model. But don\u0027t expect anything prior to the RHI verdict anyway. \n\nPublic support for the Assembly - but not the current fake one - remains high, despite the cynicism over MLA pay. Credible immediate alternatives remain in short supply. \n\nDirect rule? Non-runner for nationalists. \n\nTransfer of powers to local councils? 11 mini-Stormonts. \n\nJoint authority or unity?

You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it’s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?”\n\n“This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know.”\n\n\nIt might not be possible to take back control of the Labour Party Tony Blair tells me in first of a new season of my Political Thinking podcasts 🎧 Download here... \nhttps:t.co/CvnQV03kvP\n Listen on iTunes: \nhttps:t.co/clySpQhhRo\n / \npic.twitter/iFkJBZmFLY\n\n— Nick Robinson  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe former PM’s comments come after Labour activists in Enfield North passed a vote of no confidence in Joan Ryan, a minister in the Blair administration who now chairs Labour Friends of Israel.\n\nMr Corbyn was in Leicester on Friday to outline Labour’s plans for the water industry. \n\nWhen told that Mr Blair sees him as an “existential threat” to the party he said: “I’ve been in the Labour party all my life. I am a socialist. I am determined to see a fairer and more equal society for everybody. \n\n“That’s what the Labour party exists for. “\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMr Corbyn posed for a picture with pump station volunteers \n\n\n\n\nAsked on the visit to the Abbey Pump station whether he should heed the words of the three-time election winner, the current Labour leader said: “I’ve fought one election as leader of the party and we had the biggest swing to Labour during that campaign since 1945.\n\n“I simply say this to all Labour party members and all Labour party supporters – if you want to get rid of this Tory government, if you want to live in a society that is fairer, that is more equal, that is more just, then vote Labour and support Labour.”\n\nAnalysis of the 2017 election by the Press Association has showed that the swing to Labour from the Conservatives was 2%, compared to 10% in the 1997 landslide.\n\nHowever, last year’s snap vote did also see the largest rise in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945, from 30.4% in 2015 to 40.0%, a rise of 9.6 percentage points, something a party spokesman said had “deprived Theresa May’s Tories of their majority”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn defended his record as party leader \n\n\n\n\nMr Blair said: “There’s lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party’s lost, that the game’s over. I’m kind of hoping they’re not right.”\n\nThe former PM said the row over anti-Semitism that has engulfed the party is “ghastly” and a “matter of great sadness”.\n\nHe said he could not have imagined the row taking place in the way it did “in the Labour Party I joined, all the way through to this moment”.\n\n“I can’t imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,” he said.\n\nLord Blunkett – a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair’s administration – said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.\n\nAsked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn’t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"elements of pms brexit plan are not acceptable to brussels says barnier","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

elements of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for Brexit are “not acceptable” to Brussels, the EU’s chief negotiator has told MPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nBut a transcript of Michel Barnier’s evidence to the House of Commons Exiting the EU Committee showed that he did not describe the blueprint agreed at the PM’s country residence in July and set out in the Government’s Brexit White Paper as “dead”, as Labour MP Stephen Kinnock claimed earlier this week.\n\nIn a hearing of the committee in Westminster on Wednesday, Mr Kinnock broke into French to tell Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that the EU negotiator had told them “les propositions sont mortes” – “the proposals are dead”.\n\n“I can tell you absolutely, unequivocally, without a shadow of a doubt that Chequers is dead in the water,” the Labour committee member told Mr Raab. “Michel Barnier made it crystal clear that Chequers is completely unacceptable to the EU.”\n\n\n\nYour proposal does not seem workable to us\nEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a transcript of Monday’s meeting, held behind closed doors in Brussels, shows that, in response to repeated questioning over whether the proposals were dead, Mr Barnier insisted he was not rejecting them outright.\n\nAsked by committee chairman Hilary Benn whether the Chequers plan was “dead in the water”, Mr Barnier replied: “In the White Paper there are lots of positive things, lots of useful things, just to make that absolutely clear.\n\n“I did not just reject the White Paper outright that is just not true. I hope that you will understand that.”\n\nHowever, he made clear that Brussels will not accept Mrs May’s proposals on customs arrangements, as well as her suggestion that the UK and EU could have a free trade area with a common rulebook for goods but not services.\n\nIn a translation of his comments released by the committee, Mr Barnier said: “The proposals made in the White Paper on two points are not acceptable as they are, they are not acceptable to the EU – that is the White Paper proposal on customs and the White Paper proposal on the common rulebook for goods.”\n\nOn Mrs May’s suggestion that the UK could carry out customs checks on its borders on the EU’s behalf, he said: “Your proposal does not seem workable to us.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"older people share the

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago. Today most of its windows are broken.\n\nOnly a handful of interested people turned up\u0026nbsp at Friday\u0026rsquos auction, for which the hotel ballroom had hundreds of chairs laid out. The auctioneer, Mr Sidney Mawhinney, adjourned activity when, as he said himself, the bidding hadn\u0026rsquot gone above the price of a very good modern bungalow.\n\nAfter consulting representatives of the vendors he came back to apologise for the delay and said that \u0026pound31,000 was a \u0026ldquoridiculous figure for Drumaness Mill and its ancillary buildings sited on approximately five acres.\n\nOwnership of the building has changed at least twice since it was sold by the Ulster Weaving\u0026nbsp Group of companies for rather less than \u0026pound20,000, considered to be very reasonable at the time.\n\nHopes of new employment being provided by a hatchery concern fizzled out about five years ago, only to be renewed in 1976 when Northern Dairies \u0026mdash now Dale Farm \u0026mdash acquired the property.\n\nBALLYCULTER \u0026mdash Fungus munching brothers Peter, Michael and Mark Johnston made a startling discovery during their summer holidays near Strangford. The boys stumbled on a giant puff-ball while holidaying at Cargagh Lane, Ballyculter, and since then they have discovered that it makes good eating.\n\nIndeed, they have already munched their way through half of the puff-ball, a perfect example of Calvatia Gigantea, which is very rare.\n\n\u0026ldquoAt first we had no idea what it was, said 14 year-old Michael. \u0026ldquoWe thought it had come from outer space.\n\nSixteen year-old brother Peter said: \u0026ldquoCuriosity forded us to taste it and we have now eaten more than half of it.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is delicious when you try it in egg and breadcrumbs \u0026mdash it tastes like mushrooms. We were extremely lucky to find it because this has been a very bad year for fungi.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash The Eastern Health and Social Services Board has renewed its commitment to the building of a new general hospital in Downpatrick.\n\nSir Thomas Brown, Board chairman, told a local deputation this week that plans for the hospital had not been abandoned.\n\nSir Thomas gave the assurance to a five-man deputation from the Down District Health and Social Services Committee.\n\nAfterwards Mr O F Adams, committee chairman, said he accepted this as a \u0026ldquoclear statement of Board policy which will remain unaltered unless specific proposals to the contrary are put the Board.\n\nAnother committee member, Mr Cecil Maxwell, said he was \u0026ldquovery satisfied with the outcome of the meeting.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash The special fireworks fiesta at Newcastle on Friday night drew big crowds to Donard Park. The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

He said it was time for all\u0026nbsp the people of Northern Ireland to have their say on the current crisis which is having a major impact\u0026nbsp on daily life.\n\nJoan Martin \u0026mdash who organised last week\u0026rsquos dignified protest in Newcastle with the help of Pauline Hart\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash said there was anger that politicians were not doing the job they were elected to do, but were still getting full pay.\n\nJoan made contact with Dylan ahead of the protest and was pleased with the community response at the event where people had an opportunity to express their views on the current political impasse which has left Northern Ireland without a working government.\n\nJoan said that since the political institutions were pulled down, the Province\u0026rsquos 90 MLAs had been paid \u0026pound9m and also given themselves a pay rise.\n\n\u0026ldquoPeople deserve to have their voice heard and that is what last Tuesday night was all about, she explained. \u0026ldquoPoliticians need to explain why they continue to be paid while the health and education sectors in particular are struggling and seeing service provision cut.\n\nJoan said there is real concern that Northern Ireland is being \u0026ldquoleft to drift as there is no effective political leadership which people voted for. She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

It is something they want to try and address to make the town even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.\n\nMournes councillor Laura Devlin said that due to the force of nature there was no way of maintaining a sandy beach, which was why s he believed a pop-up beach on top of the promenade was an alternative worth pursuing.\n\nShe believes the move would provide Newcastle with that beachy summer feel and was pleased council officers were to examine if a temporary beach could be provided and the costs involved.\n\n\u0026ldquoTourism is the district\u0026rsquos biggest economic driver so let\u0026rsquos see what more we can do to improve the product we have to offer and provide a new outdoor amenity for people in the resort as well, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Environment Agency has determined, along with other coastal erosion experts, that due to the construction\u0026nbsp\n\nof the promenade, sand is naturally depleted from Newcastle beach and there will never be enough of it to form a usable beach.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
