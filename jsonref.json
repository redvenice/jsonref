In 1952, in the death throes of the British Empire, it would have been unimaginable for a member of the Royal Family to have married a black or mixed-race person. Black people in Africa, or indeed this country, were too often expected to be servants or, if educated, lawyers or docile politicians.         Meghan ended up in what is believed to be a private London hospital, though this has not yet been confirmed. Nor have the identities of the doctors present at the birth been revealed, or thanks publicly proffered, as is normally the case with royal births        There had been uproar a few years earlier when Seretse Khama, the English-educated member of the royal family in what later became Botswana, married Ruth Williams, a middle-class English woman. The Labour government of the time even tried to stop this inter-racial marriage. It nonetheless went ahead, and Khama eventually became the president of his country.It’s only a picture, you may say — and that is true, but it is one that tells a crucial story about enormous change in our country.Many families in Britain could offer themselves as exemplars of racial concord but not, until now, the Royal Family.A visitor from Mars presented with this photo might observe the unstuffiness of these people — their normality and ease with one another. Here is a version of the Royal Family attuned to modern Britain.These are values which Harry and Meghan (the latter I suspect being the prime mover in this endeavour) wish to project in their own way, perhaps not fully aware of the magnitude of the historic changes they have ushered in. Archie is unwittingly a standard-bearer of something new.       None of this racial amity will have seemed remotely strange to the Queen, as she has devoted herself to the Commonwealth during her reign, and made many friends in Africa and elsewhere, not least the great Nelson Mandela His parents plainly yearn to escape what they regard as the stultifying bonds of tradition. Their plan was for the baby to be born in their home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, rather than at some swanky clinic near Harley Street, attended to by Sir Humphrey This, or Sir Lancelot That.As it happened, Meghan ended up in what is believed to be a private London hospital, though this has not yet been confirmed. Nor have the identities of the doctors present at the birth been revealed, or thanks publicly proffered, as is normally the case with royal births.The very name ‘Archie’ — he will not be christened ‘Archibald’ — is apparently intended to convey a lack of pomposity. It may even suggest a certain raciness. There is a P. G. Wodehouse character called Archie Moffam, who has some of Bertie Wooster’s amiable but unsteady qualities, and is a bit of a card.Although Archie would be entitled to use the courtesy title of Earl of Dumbarton, Harry and Meghan want him to be known as homespun Master Mountbatten-Windsor. However, this apparent act of humility may only be temporary, and he will assume a title when Prince Charles becomes king.Few people, I think, would cavil at these attempts by Harry and Meghan to sidestep some of the cumbersome paraphernalia of royal life, though I personally would like the doctors to have been publicly thanked, as is the custom. Still, I can see it is hardly a big deal.In many ways, the fresh approach of the young couple, and their desire to forge their own path, are welcome. The trouble is that there seem to be more motives at play than just a desire simply to do things their own way and avoid the circus that usually attends royal births.During the past week we have had glimpses of other agendas. In Harry’s case, his deep wariness of the Press has surfaced again. Meghan seemingly shares some of that — though as a former actress in an American TV drama she knows how to cheerfully use the media when it suits her — but her preferences appear to be more shaped by a desire to be appreciated in her home country.There is no denying that over the past few days there have been some bizarre aspects to the stage-managing of events. In some cases it would seem that there has been deliberate subterfuge.For example, having been informed by Harry or his officials, Buckingham Palace released a statement at 1.49pm on Monday to the effect that Meghan was in labour. In fact, she had already given birth eight hours earlier.Perhaps the misinformation does not matter very much, though it is bound to be annoying for journalists, who are used to fairly straight dealing with royal spin doctors. The point is it is always advisable to tell the truth. The refusal to admit where the birth had taken place was very odd.It seems Harry was determined to withhold all but the bare essentials. Of course he and Meghan are entitled to their privacy, but as members of the Royal Family, whose leading lights are funded by the taxpayer, they have an inescapable public role — and the duties that come with it.When Archie was eventually presented to the world’s media in a rather orchestrated encounter, he was so swaddled in clothes, with most of his head covered in a bonnet, that he might almost have been a stage prop. It was as though his parents wanted to share as little of him as possible with the world.While Harry might be accused of being a bit curmudgeonly, Meghan risked the charge of favouritism by inviting her close friend Gayle King — who happens to also be the presenter of a morning show for the U.S. CBS network — to spend some time with her.The suspicion may grow that Meghan who, as a former actress, loves the camera, is anxious to cultivate her image, and bathe in widespread adulation, in the land of her birth.As for Harry, his attitude towards the media is understandable, founded as it is in his belief that his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was pursued by the Press and hounded to her death by feral paparazzi.In truth, she had many personal dealings with journalists, and her death was chiefly caused by her speeding, inebriated chauffeur.But Harry, whose opinion of the Press was not enhanced during his younger days of sowing wild oats, and as a result sometimes appearing on newspaper front pages in an undignified way, can’t, or won’t, see the whole picture.Only a couple of months ago, he lumped the mainstream media together with social media, and accused them jointly of ‘distorting the truth and trying to manipulate the power of positive thinking’.It goes without saying that the Press is far from perfect. But despite apparently believing that they can interact satisfactorily with people via their Instagram account, Harry and Meghan need the mainstream media in order to communicate with the general public.In the end, the media can look after themselves. However, if people should get the idea that they are being fed self-serving half-truths — as appears to have happened this past week — that will not be good for the brave new Royal Family they are helping to build.Let me return to that photo, and the impression it creates of a modern monarchy in tune with 21st-century Britain. It is, as I say, as though Harry and Meghan are harbingers of a force much bigger than themselves.When we remember past monarchs and their reigns, we often think of portraits which caught the mood of the age. Holbein’s famous picture (a copy, I fear) of a bejewelled and truculent Henry VIII Van Dyck’s portraits of a vainglorious Charles I myriad paintings of Queen Victoria, from attractive young woman to stout Empress of India.Is it too much to suppose that a future age might look back to our own, and see in this photo — with the Queen on happy and equal terms with a black yoga teacher who lives in Los Angeles — the completion of a revolution she helped to start 67 years ago, which has now been brought to fruition by Harry, Meghan and Archie?"},{"url":null,"title":"Movie ticket prices double cities postcode lottery","story":"Share this article Even when visiting the same cinema chain, prices still differ depending on location.

The standard rental allowance rose to more than £22,000. In 2017 the allowance per child was increased from £2,425 to £5,435. It meant an MP with three dependent children could be entitled to a total allowance of almost £40,000 a year to rent a second home in London.Other MPs who have claimed for adult children include Tory Jack Lopresti, who lives with his wife, fellow Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns. In 2017, he incorrectly registered to claim up to £10,870 for two dependents.He said it referred to children from his former marriage, who are over 18.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe unprepossessing north inner city pub, The Ref on Ballybough Road, is the unlikely registered office for a number of companies with which the Dublin Lord Mayor, Nial Ring, has been associated with over the years.The building, which is owned by Mr Ring and his sometimes business partner, Liam McGrattan, plays host, on the floor over the bar, to a publicly listed company called IMC Exploration Group plc.Founded in 2011, the company is involved in looking for gold and other metals in three sites, in Wicklow, Wexford and Clare. Its shares trade on the NEX exchange in London, which describes itself as an exchange for “growth companies”.The IMC shares trade for as low as 1p, but sometimes spike to double that. The nominal value of all its issued shares (its share capital) is currently £2.8 million (€3.2m).As it has no trading income, having not as yet made any great discoveries, it supports itself by raising funds from investors willing to take a punt.At the end of December last, IMC had accumulated losses of £3.43 million, but was still in business. During the year to October 2018, it sold new shares to the market on four occasions, raising a total of £520,000 to fund its ongoing operations.Both Mr McGrattan and Mr Ring resigned from the IMC board in May of last year. According to its latest filed accounts, Mr Ring owned 5.13 per cent of the company in November 2018.The notes to the company’s accounts say that during the year he provided the company with professional services to the value of £97,892. He was issued with shares to the value of £108,772, in lieu of payment.Similar dealings occurred between the company and Mr McGrattan, as they did with other connected parties also.So while IMC has never struck gold, and never made a profit, it has raised a lot of money over the years, and continues to do so.Proventus RenewablesA similar situation used to apply with Proventus Renewables plc, which had its registered office over the pub and traded its shares on the Danish GXG exchange, which has since closed.At one stage Proventus was looking to make money from wind energy in Bulgaria, but before that it had a different name, Captive Audience Display Solutions plc (Cads), and was focused on trying to sell advertising in Irish petrol forecourts.Mr McGrattan and Mr Ring were involved in Proventus at board level and were also major shareholders. The share price rose and fell over the years, and the company never produced a profit.In 2008, for instance, the company lost €774,734 but raised €577,674 from the issuing of new shares.During 2013, by which time it had turned its attention towards Bulgaria, it lost €7,444,221. The company was dissolved in 2017.Searching for oilAnother Dublin company with which the Lord Mayor and Mr McGrattan have been involved is called US Oil \u0026amp Gas, which is in the business of looking for oil in Nevada.Incorporated in June 2009, its shares were traded on the London Plus market from 2010. The shares sold for as low as 7p each and for as high as 97p. Trading was suspended by Plus in October 2011, with the operators citing a “disorderly market”.The shares were delisted in April 2012, and immediately listed on the Danish-regulated GXG. They rose in value to almost £7 during 2012. The Plus market has since closed. Mr Ring and Mr McGrattan resigned from the company’s board back in 2010.US Oil \u0026amp Gas has its registered office in Ballsbridge and is still active, but its shares are not publicly traded.Mr McGrattan and Mr Ring were also involved (as executive chairman and finance director respectively) with a company called Teknomining plc, which launched its shares on the Plus market in 2010 with a view to funding mining exploration in Turkey. The company raised £568,093. The share price went from as low as 13p to as high as £2.42.Teknomining had exploration licences in Turkey. In 2012, Mr Ring and Mr McGrattan stepped down from the board and a new board began a review of the company’s affairs. In April 2013 it was announced to the market that the company had yet to fulfil an agreement with the local landowner in Turkey, and that, failing its completion, “the landowner will not allow access to his property, which is the company’s main target for copper and nickel”.The day after the announcement was released, trading in the company’s shares was suspended at the board’s request. Subsequently, Mr Ring and Mr McGrattan threatened to sue the directors for defamation. The directors said they would contest any proceedings. No such proceedings were ever brought to hearing.In 2014, Mr Ring told The  that all announcements made by Teknomining during his time on the board had been approved by the company’s corporate adviser and that he had no difficulty standing over every one. He said he was confident the company’s fortunes would improve. Teknomining was dissolved in 2015.Mr Ring also told The  that he had made a “reasonable profit” from trading in the shares of Proventus, US Oil \u0026amp Gas, and IMC, which at that stage (2014) had between them racked up losses of about £7 million.CriticismAn accountant, he contested the idea of criticising companies that were involved in exploration on the basis of their not producing annual profits. People did not talk about larger exploration companies, such as Providence Resources plc, in that way.“It’s not like running a corner shop, where you put your money in and get an immediate return.“We are all big boys. We evaluate the management teams and the projects and we put the money in.”A friend of the former taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, for 10 years up to 2008, Mr Ring was a member of the board of IDA Ireland.Despite his long-time association with Fianna Fáil, Mr Ring put himself forward as an independent when he first successfully sought a seat on Dublin City Council in 2009.Northside homesBoth Mr McGrattan and Mr Ring live in attractive homes in Clontarf, Dublin 3. Mr Ring’s home is a substantial detached redbrick house on St Lawrence Road. Mr McGrattan also lives in a very valuable Clontarf residence.In 2013, a short video was uploaded on YouTube showing the staff in the Shelbourne Hotel lining up and clapping Mr McGrattan as he walked towards the hotel’s revolving door.“The Shelbourne Hotel’s long-term resident Liam McGrattan leaving after two years’ stay,” is the title on the video, in which Mr McGrattan is the subject of a short address by the manager. Mr McGrattan had been living at the St Stephen’s Green hotel while his Clontarf home was being rebuilt, including a swimming pool put in the back garden, according to the Dublin City planning files. Asked about this, Mr McGrattan said it was a private matter.Mr McGrattan disputed the suggestion that any of the resource companies he had been involved with had not been successful. The shareholders in Cads had been paid shares in US Oil \u0026amp Gas worth Stg£21 million, he said. “Do you call that unsuccessful? There is nothing unsuccessful about any company I was involved with.”Court proceedingsCourt records show that Mr Ring has been the defendant in 16 sets of High Court proceedings since 2004, of which nine were taken by banks.One set of proceedings was taken by the Revenue in 2013 and was settled by agreement the following year. Mr Ring told The  this week that the case involved capital gains tax, but would not say how the debt arose or how much was involved.The courts issued a possession order to the Bank of Ireland in May 2017, in relation to his Clontarf home, because of a failure to make mortgage repayments. A stay was put on the order and Mr Ring said he would sell assets in order to settle the debt. Counsel for the then councillor told the court that Mr Ring had found a new job as consultant to a mine-drilling company in which US companies had a takeover interest.Although the stay on the possession order involved a requirement that the Rings pay the bank €10,000 a month, no such payment was made.In February the possession order was struck out after the judge was told that Mr Ring and his wife, Joyce, had paid €1 million to the bank to settle the debt and legal fees. The court was told the source of the funds could not be disclosed for “data protection reasons”.Earlier this week Mr Ring told The  that he would be “happy” to discuss the source of the funds but that his wife doesn’t want to. “There’s plenty of lenders out there,” he said, but would not elaborate.Documents in the Registry of Deeds show that the Bank of Ireland registered a mortgage against the house in 2005.They also show that a judgment order from the High Court, dated May 2015, was registered against the property on behalf of Bank of Scotland in July 2018.Publicly recorded judgment orders against Mr Ring show debts of more than €580,000 outstanding to two banks.A judgment order for €468,249 was registered against the Rings in favour of Investec Bank, in March of 2017. Mr Ring was later asked a series of questions about these matters, but has not responded.The records also show that a judgment order on behalf of Ulster Bank for €129,318 was registered against him in September 2012. Both debts remain outstanding, the records indicate. A request for a comment about these judgments met with no response.Mr Ring was voted Lord Mayor of Dublin in June last. Members of the city council from Sinn Féin, Labour and a grouping of Independents, have a deal in relation to rotating the mayorship.He is a candidate in the north inner city ward in the local elections that are to take place later this month.

After she featured on the radio, a genealogist offered to help her to realise her seemingly impossible dream.They pieced together enough of the genealogical puzzle to locate the woman Mackin had been looking for. Perhaps even more remarkably, she was still alive. Her name is Elizabeth and she celebrates her 104th birthday this coming Saturday.Birthday presentShe received an early and unexpected birthday present on April 11th when her first-born daughter visited her at the home she shares with one of her two sons.“I just went over with my daughter and my husband and her husband and I knocked on the door and a gentleman opened it, and I told him I was from Ireland and that I had found my mum and could I come to see her, and he said ‘certainly’,” Mackin said.The woman she had sought for so long was sitting in the livingroom, and Mackin approached and explained she had come from Ireland to see her.“She said: ‘I was born in Ireland,’ and she was thrilled and she never let go of my hands and she put her arms around me.”Mackin said that when she asked if she knew that she was her daughter, Elizabeth “just looked up at me and took my hand and we had a great chat. There was such a bond between the two of us, it was fantastic.”The meeting was almost exactly how Mackin dreamed it would be.“I said to my children all my life that I loved this lady but I didn’t know who she was. And that is exactly what I got when I went to the door,” she said. “If you saw her little face, such a happy little lady, she is just fantastic. I can’t believe this surprise I got at this stage in my life, you can’t understand how thrilled I am.”GoodbyeMackin said it was hard to say goodbye to the woman she had spent so long looking for.“She wouldn’t let me go but I was afraid to stay too long with her because she is elderly and I have to respect that. But her son was so lovely and my mum said to me: ‘Oh I wish I could get up and make some tea for you but I don’t think I’ll be able.”Mackin and her family spent three days in Scotland before returning to Ireland.“I am going around singing, I’m that happy,” she said. “You have no idea what is has done to me. I’m just so happy and I’m so grateful.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3888196.1557517012!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"siteserv inquiry seeks to compel catherine murphy to appear over deal claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSocial Democrats TD Catherine Murphy is believed to be considering a range of possibilities and seeking advice on her options in relation to the commission of inquiry. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government-appointed commission investigating the sale of building services firm Siteserv to a Denis O’Brien-owned company has directed the politician who first questioned the deal to appear before it.The commission of inquiry headed by Mr Justice Brian Cregan is seeking to compel Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy to testify about statements she made in the Dáil in 2015 regarding the transaction.The investigation, which was established almost four years ago and is expected to cost more than €30 million, is investigating the sale of Siteserv, now called Actavo, to Mr O’Brien’s company Millington in 2012.The Isle of Man firm purchased the construction-related company for €45 million after the State-owned Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, gave Siteserv a loan write-down of €110 million.The sale attracted controversy because shareholders in Siteserv were paid €5 million despite the State-owned lender suffering a loss on the company and because another bidder took issue with the transaction.Ms Murphy made statements in the Dáil in April 2015 raising concerns about the purchase. She called for a full independent inquiry into the 2012 deal and a number of IBRC transactions, leading the then taoiseach Enda Kenny to establish the commission of inquiry two months later.Commission termsMr Kenny’s government asked Mr Justice Cregan, a High Court judge and the commission’s sole member, to investigate transactions involving IBRC that resulted in losses of 10 million or more to the State. However, the terms of the commission were changed a year later to focus initially on the 2012 Siteserv sale.Neither the commission nor Ms Murphy would comment on the TD’s potential appearance before the inquiry, which is taking evidence from various parties connected to the transaction in private.The Kildare North TD had been invited to appear before the commission in February and four days were set aside for her appearance that month, but she has not yet given evidence. The politician is believed to be considering a range of possibilities and seeking advice on her options.She is said to be intent on resisting any attempts to compel her to reveal the source of the information behind her Dáil statements about Mr O’Brien’s banking affairs and the concerns she raised about the Siteserv transaction.The commission has sought a series of extensions to complete its work having initially faced a deadline of December 31st, 2015. Mr Justice Cregan had sought an extension until the end of next March. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar extended its timeframe until at least the end of this month.Mr Varadkar, who put the €30 million-plus estimate on the potential cost of the investigation, had wanted the commission to complete its work by the end of March but then granted it a further two months.A large number of lawyers are involved in the commission and representing the various financial advisory firms and parties who worked on the Siteserv transaction.Ms Murphy has previously criticised the work of the commission for taking a “highly legalistic approach” and saying that it was following a format that was “akin to a tribunal of inquiry rather than a private investigation”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3887564.1557482820!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may urged not to go ahead with uk festival as it clashes with partition centenary","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May has announced a year-long Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for 2022. Photograph: PAAn influential British think tank has urged the British government not to go ahead with a UK-wide festival in 2022 because it clashes with the centenary of partition. At the Conservative Party conference last October, British prime minister Theresa May announced there would be a year-long Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in that year. It would be similar, she suggested, to the 1851 Great Exhibition in London or the 1951 Festival of Britain and was envisaged as a “showcase of what makes our country great today”, Mrs May said. Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future think tank, said the whole process appears to have been derailed by the protracted negotiations over Brexit. He said the festival will coincide with significant and controversial centenaries including the foundation of the Irish State in 1922, which copperfastened partition following the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and the foundation of Northern Ireland in 1921. “The specific coincidence with the politics of Irish history and the politics of Brexit means you are not going to have a festival which works across the nations of the UK and across communities in Northern Ireland,” he said. In any case, he believes 2022 is too early to host such a festival. “It would take them at least three years to get it right. You could hold it successfully in 2025,” he said.British Future examines issues of British identity and culture. It produced a report for the British government on the effectiveness of the country’s first World War commemorations between 2014 and 2018. Mr Katwala, whose mother is from Midleton, Co Cork, said the Irish Decade of Centenaries had been conducted successfully to date because it had sought to acknowledge that “moments that are potentially isive are also potentially important”. Mr Katwala pointed to a recent controversial interview with the conservative thinker Roger Scruton who referenced Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as a “Hindu immigrant”. Mr Katwala added: “It betrays a lack of understanding of Irish history. The British-Irish relationship between 1986 and 2016 is probably the most successful three decades of intergovernmental relationships that we have ever had. We are letting that fray a bit and relations have become a bit of a pawn in the frustrations over Brexit.” Prof Sir Hew Strachan, one of Britain’s best known historians, said proposals to extend public commemorations of the first World War to include events afterwards such as the Irish War of Independence never got far. Sir Hew was a member of the UK advisory committee on the first World War which he described as another casualty of Brexit. A debrief that was scheduled to discuss how the first World War centenary had gone and what should follow was never held. Sir Hew said some members of the committee were keen to extend the centenary commemorations to embrace Britain’s imperial obligations after the war, which included Ireland, India, Mesopotamia, Iraq and Egypt – all which proved to be troublesome regions. “The fighting didn’t just stop in November 1918 as Ireland knows only too well. The view of the Government as expressed by ministers and Andrew Murrison (British prime minister’s adviser on commemorations) for the First World War was that getting to the finishing line of November the 11th was about as much as they had stamina for,” he said. “We never got as far as Ireland. There are issues that are potentially instructive about the complexity of war and peace. Ireland exposes all of that. I think they (the British government) will find it difficult because it is politically difficult for them today.” Sir Hew said the British public was “extraordinarily ignorant” about their country’s imperial past. “They don’t even have a nostalgic view of Empire. They have forgotten they even had one.”He said British school was “all about the Nazis” and that Britain standing alone in 1940 has been used by Brexiteers in a “contrived and self-selecting way”. He added: “I say as a historian that there is a lack of historical awareness which is extraordinary when other countries and other peoples have a much greater sense of their own past. “We don’t have a sense of historical understanding which represents the complexity or depth of any of this. You see it in the cavalier attitude taken towards the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. They really don’t see how important it is.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Henry NichollsReuters Brexit talks between Theresa May’s government and the British Labour Party could determine the future of Britain and Ireland, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has told an audience in London. Speaking after meetings with politicians including Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn and Keir Starmer, Mr Coveney said the talks represented the best hope of resolving the impasse over Brexit at Westminster. “The future of both of our countries may well rely on the outcome of those talks. So while it will be very difficult given the ision both within parties and across parties in Westminster to find solutions on Brexit, I do think there is a serious effort by both parties,” he said. “I don’t expect that process to be easy and you shouldn’t either. But we do need to give it a chance because I think it is our best chance right now of finding a way through a very, very difficult, isive and corrosive debate, quite frankly, across British society.” Mr Coveney was speaking at the Ireland Funds Great Britain annual City lunch at London’s Mansion House, which was attended by many leading Irish figures in business, law and financial services in the British capital. Sense of urgencyHe expressed concern that the six-month extension to article 50 agreed by EU leaders last month had led some at Westminster to relax their sense of urgency about resolving Brexit. He warned Conservatives that a new leader will not be able to reopen the withdrawal agreement or change the terms of the Northern Ireland backstop. “There should be no illusions in the United Kingdom that a change to the political circumstances here and a change to the personalities in terms of the political leadership will convince the EU to make changes to the withdrawal agreement, which wasn’t designed on the basis of personalities. It was designed on the basis of evidence and facts and legal agreements that are required to deal with the complexity of what’s happening right now,” he said. ‘Vulnerable’ NorthThe Tánaiste said the resumption of talks between the parties in Northern Ireland was a positive move but he warned of the danger of a no-deal Brexit while the Stormont institutions remained suspended. “I believe Northern Ireland is in a more vulnerable place now than it has been at any time during the last 21 years since the peace agreement. And think about this for a second: if a failure of politics results in Britain leaving the European Union without a deal in place, Northern Ireland in my view will be the most vulnerable part of these islands in terms of the exposure to the downside of that,” he said. “And they won’t even have their own government to make decisions to put contingency plans in place. And I think that the pressures that are already there in a very ided society in Northern Ireland will be very difficult to contain for both the British and Irish governments trying to work together in response to that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3884170.1557256045!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain and ireland to sign common travel area deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney and David Lidington will sign the agreement in London on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.

Photograph: ReutersHenry NichollsThe British and Irish governments have signed an agreement that formally outlines the provisions of the Common Travel Area (CTA) for the first time and guarantees the reciprocal rights it confers regardless of Brexit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney and cabinet office minister David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, signed the agreement in London on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council (BIIGC).“Our message to Irish citizens in the UK is that your rights will not change. You will still be able to move freely between Ireland, the UK and the islands.“You will still be able to work, study, draw your pension and access social security and public services in the UK. Above all, you will be welcome. And we welcome the similar commitment the Government of Ireland makes to British citizens in Ireland,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Coveney said the agreement should reassure British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in Britain that, regardless of whether Britain leaves with or without a deal, their rights and privileges would be protected. “This Memorandum of Understanding is comprehensive but it’s also flexible enough to be able to be updated and changed in the future if necessary and will be backed up with legislation in the necessary areas,” he said. Mr Lidington and Mr Coveney were joined by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley for the two-hour BIIGC meeting. Established under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the BIIGC did not meet from 2007 until last July but met again last November.Wednesday’s meeting focused on the future of the east-west relationship, economic cooperation, security issues in Northern Ireland and legacy issues as well as the Stormont talks.“The theme running through this is how we can strengthen our bilateral cooperation on everything from economic regeneration to security and justice. We obviously very much welcomed the resumption this week of talks aimed at restoring the Executive at Stormont,” Mr Lidington said. The memorandum of understanding sets out an agreed policy framework for the CTA, which not only guarantees free movement of people between Britain and Ireland but covers access to social security, health and education. The two governments have agreed to maintain existing arrangements on social insurance, child benefit and pensions. They have also agreed to work on new arrangements to ensure that British and Irish citizens will continue to have equal access to public health and education services in both countries.Newcastle University’s Colin Murray, a legal academic in the research project NI Constitution who campaigned for the CTA to be codified, said the agreement had been largely settled for months. “It is being concluded now because there is a period of relatively low tension in the Brexit negotiations, because the Irish and UK governments being seen to work together supports the drive towards a deal on restoring power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, and because, from the Irish Government’s perspective, Theresa May might not be long in office, and the CTA therefore needs to be locked down,” he told The .Business groups welcomed the agreement and John McGrane, director general of the British-Irish Chamber, said the free movement of people between Britain and Ireland brought tangible economic benefits.“The CTA helps support the €70 billion annual trade between our countries. It has resulted in there being more Irish Directors of UK companies than any other foreign nationality and it has contributed to Irish companies being the fifth largest foreign owners of UK firms,” he said.“Today’s agreement will go some way to protecting these achievements. However, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce remains clear in its view that the best way of protecting the economic and social links between these islands is through an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU followed by an unprecedented close future relationship. We encourage public representatives on all sides to work together to make this happen.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3888240.1557522192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china vows to take retaliatory action over us tariffs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Chinese vice premier Liu He, second left,  says goodbye to US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, centre,   and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer as they break from meetings  in Washington, DC. Photograph:  Chip Somodevilla Getty ImagesChina vowed to take retaliatory action after the United States slapped tariffs on Chinese exports on Friday, escalating the growing trade war between the world’s two largest economies.After last-minute negotiations in Washington on Thursday evening failed to reach a breakthrough, tariffs on Chinese products went into effect at midnight on Friday. Some $200 billion (€178 billion) worth of exports to the United States will now be subject to 25 per cent rather than 10 per cent tariffs.The new tariffs will apply to goods that left China on Friday, and will impact a range of products, from household goods to clothes to car parts.Though talks continued again on Friday in Washington between US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and China’s vice premier, Liu He, they too ended without agreement.President Trump tweeted that the two sides had held “candid and constructive conversations” on trade, and insisted that the relationship between himself and Xi Jinping “remains a very strong one”. He said “conversations” would continue between the two sides, a move that helped to buoy markets.However, earlier in the day he said he was preparing to impose a 25 per cent tariff on the remaining $325 billion in Chinese imports that have so far not been affected, highlighting the trade imbalance between China and the United States. “Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch!” he tweeted. “In the meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last minute.”China said it was considering “necessary counter-measures” which will likely worry American farmers who have already been hit by tariffs on soybeans and other agricultural exports that Beijing introduced in response to previous US tariffs.Plight of farmers Mr Trump referenced the plight of farmers – an important Republican constituency – in a tweet on Friday, claiming that the US would use the money gained by the tariffs to buy US agricultural products “in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor \u0026amp starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance”.Last year the Trump administration introduced a special $12 billion rescue package for farmers who were hit by retaliatory tariffs on US goods introduced in response to US tariffs on China.As well as attempts to address the trade imbalance between the two countries, the United States has been pressing China to change its rules on intellectual property for foreign companies doing business in the country.Stock marketsWall Street, which has been shaken all week by Mr Trump’s threat last weekend to move ahead with the tariffs, had another rocky day on Friday. Though the main indices did not see the steep losses many had been expecting, the stock market was on course for its worst week this year. The benchmark S\u0026ampP 500 ended up 0.4 per cent, having been down by 1.6 per cent earlier in the day.Separately, the state department announced on Friday that secretary of state Mike Pompeo will visit Russia next week.Mr Pompeo will travel to Sochi and Moscow, and is scheduled to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin. It will be his first trip to Russia as secretary of state.“We have many areas of disagreement with the Russian government and the secretary will have a very candid conversation about concerns in our bilateral relationship,” a senior state department official told reporters on Friday.Among the topics on the agenda are likely to be North Korea, Afghanistan and Venezuela, where the United States has accused Russia of shoring up support for Nicolas Maduro. Mr Trump spoke to Mr Putin by phone last week, but said he did not discuss Russia’s interference in the 2016 election."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

The Foreign Office and DFID need to work closely together but I think DFID has more than proved its worth both in driving aid effectiveness but also in increasing British clout.It’s been striking and good that an innovation of the Labour government has not been trashed by the Tories but has been continued.He also praised the appointment of Rory Stewart as international development secretary, particularly as he has experience of working in Afghanistan and Iraq as a soldier and in the department as a junior minister. It’s an exciting appointment, a welcome appointment and one which hopefully means that he’s not going to need a year or two to bed himself in, he said. Mr Miliband was talking to the  from Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he was visiting staff responding to the Ebola epidemic currently raging in the North Kivu region of the country.The Ebola outbreak escalated in April, with 126 cases in a single weekHe said that he had concerns that the outbreak was not being brought under control and that a reset was needed.The latest figures from the DRC ministry of health show that as of May 9 there have been 1604 cases of Ebola, including 1074 deaths, since the outbreak was first declared in the North Kivu region of the country in August.Mr Miliband was unable to visit IRC staff at the heart of the response because of an upsurge in the violence in Butembo, one of the cities at the epicentre of the outbreak.On Wednesday armed men launched several attacks in the city, killing a policeman. In a counter-attack by government forces 10 of the assailants were killed and six were captured.Mr Miliband, who was UK foreign secretary between 2007 and 2010, said that it was time to rethink the response.“The current financing plan runs out in July and there’s no way this is going to be over in July,” he said.“Carrying on as we are is not going to sort this crisis out,” he added.Centres set ablaze | The violence hampering the Ebola responseHe said there needed to be better coordination between large multilateral organisations such as the World Health Organization and the various NGOs that were responding to the crisis.He added that responders had to work harder had to build trust among the communities affected by the disease.“The view among our own staff is that there is a lack of trust in the local community and that’s fuelling the insecurity that exists. We don’t have armed guards in our facilities because our experience is that’s not the way to engender the support or acceptance or trust of the community,” he said.There are more than 100 armed groups operating in the North Kivu region and the threat of violence has overshadowed the response - just last month a doctor in one of the Ebola treatment centres was killed, prompting health workers to stage a strike.Mr Miliband said that that it was “unprecedented” to fight an Ebola outbreak in what is essentially a conflict zoneHe added: “This is already the second largest Ebola outbreak in history, already 1000 people are dead but my takeaway is that this is a far more dangerous situation than the statistic of 1000 dead - appalling as it is - suggests.“There are good reasons to believe the disease is not under control. April saw the highest recorded number of cases - 406. Now we’re in month 10 the danger is it spikes and spreads,” he said.More than 111,000 people have been vaccinated against the disease in the affected area and earlier this week WHO announced that it would be expanding the pool of people eligible for vaccination. It also said it was considering the introduction of a second vaccine to those at lower risk of contracting the disease.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleDr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the epidemic was in a “truly frightening phase”.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security  Democratic Republic of CongoBBC cancel Have I Got News For You episode over appearance of Change UK leader Heidi Allen MPMPs claim expenses for adult children: allowances topped up under rule originally intended to help young familiesMPs urged to use GPS trackers so expenses watchdog can evaluate their mileage claimsLyra McKee: Two men charged with riot and petrol bomb offencesComment: These are the first European elections in history to feel enthusiastic aboutFormer Cabinet minister Dominic Grieve faces deselection vote next month from Tory activists furious over Brexit Boris Johnson: Second EU referendum supporters are helping the SNP\u0026#39s independence driveAt least 65 migrants drown as boat capsizes off coast of TunisiaSimon Armitage is unveiled as the UK’s new Poet LaureateSix million more people  to escape charges for reporting crimes on 101 as Talk Talk pledges to scrap themDavina McCall calls for gyms to take inspiration from Narcotics Anonymous meetingsBarbers have become the fastest growing shops on the British high streetTwo commandos killed as French special forces free four hostages in Burkina FasoComment: The only thing that can save the wretched Tory party now is a grassroots guerrilla warComment: The French are welcome to Land Rover – ever since it got rid of the Defender, the wheels have fallen offCould Amber Rudd\u0026#39s attack on the Tory \u0026#39parade of wives\u0026#39 mean a leadership pact with Boris Johnson?Temporary Parliament \u0026#39extravagant, time wasting and destructive\u0026#39, say heritage campaigners and architectsChina accused of secret lobbying campaign in UK against its critics Two rogue police officers who sabotaged child abuse cases ditched work to have four-hour lunch breakSajid Javid says he is attacked daily online by Asians and the \u0026#39far Left\u0026#39 because he is not \u0026#39brown enough\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2018/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000181648782_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450\" s","title":"french welcome land rover ever since got rid defender wheels","story":"Nothing marked the decline of Land Rover so greatly as the discontinuation of the original modelThe Range Rover has long inspired the French, being the first car ever exhibited as a work of art at the Louvre.

The role of Laureate is not necessarily about writing. It’s more about advocacy and and initiatives and projects,” he said.Asked to define what a Poet Laureate does, the 55-year-old Yorkshireman said it is “an ambassadorial role, a ceremonial role, where you get the opportunity to endorse poetry and speak up on behalf of it.”In the public imagination, the Poet Laureate produces work to mark royal occasions. Ted Hughes, the last lifetime holder, took his relationship with the Crown seriously.Carol Ann Duffy, who Armitage succeeds, was accused of being a reluctant chronicler of royal events, preferring to write odes to gas meters and David Beckham’s torn Achilles, but did commemorate the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.However, there is no requirement to cover royal events, a fact reinforced by Theresa May when she telephoned Armitage on Wednesday to bestow the position upon him.“It is not in the job spec - there is absolutely no obligation to do that, and the Prime Minister made that clear to me as well,” said Armitage, who until recently was Oxford University’s Professor of Poetry.“It is still a royal appointment… but I think it’s become a much more everyday, commonplace, domestic activity now in the workspace of poetry and not just something that’s seen as it was in the old days as a duty or a requirement or an invitation to write about royal occasions.”There will be no poem marking the arrival of baby Archie - “No, I think I might have missed that boat” - but Armitage has no antipathy towards the Royal family.“I’ve been made CBE, been given the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry, so I’m hardly a rampant republican,” he said.Whether or not he writes any poems as Laureate will depend on when the inspiration takes hold of him. “If I knew where to get these poems I’d go down there with a shopping trolley and get a load of them tomorrow,” he joked.“Being a poet is sometimes a little bit like being lost on the moor in fog - you just look for the next landmark, head to it, and hope that it’s a poem.“What I am absolutely confident about is that I’m not going to hand over anything to anybody that I’m not pleased with. In my view there is no worse gift to anybody than a bad poem.”Other poets, including Wendy Cope and Benjamin Zephaniah, have said they would never take the job.“I think it’s sometimes a human defence mechanism to say you don’t want something you’re not going to be offered. Get you retaliation in early,” Armitage said.From my own point of view, I’ve always seen this as the high point of the kind of writing that I do. In some ways I’ve been an apprentice to a kind of public poetry for three decades now.“To that extent it seems to be that the role suits me in the way it might not suit other people.”He plans to use the £5,750 honorarium to fund a prize or event promoting poetry on climate change, and is looking for financial backers.“I just think it’s incredibly important that, like all art forms, poetry reacts to this situation. It is unignorable. We do have people who are writing climate change poetry and nature poetry, and I would like to try and orchestrate something that makes that more official and recognises it.“A lot of my passion lies in that direction and I think it is a subject matter fit for our age.”The post also comes with a supply of sherry, which Armitage said he will probably give away as prizes: “I can’t see myself getting through 700 bottles of sherry at home. If I do the work might take a little bit of a dip.”Please review our commenting policyBBC cancel Have I Got News For You episode over appearance of Change UK leader Heidi Allen MPMPs claim expenses for adult children: allowances topped up under rule originally intended to help young familiesMPs urged to use GPS trackers so expenses watchdog can evaluate their mileage claimsLyra McKee: Two men charged with riot and petrol bomb offencesComment: These are the first European elections in history to feel enthusiastic aboutFormer Cabinet minister Dominic Grieve faces deselection vote next month from Tory activists furious over Brexit Boris Johnson: Second EU referendum supporters are helping the SNP\u0026#39s independence driveAt least 65 migrants drown as boat capsizes off coast of TunisiaSix million more people  to escape charges for reporting crimes on 101 as Talk Talk pledges to scrap themDavina McCall calls for gyms to take inspiration from Narcotics Anonymous meetingsBarbers have become the fastest growing shops on the British high streetTwo commandos killed as French special forces free four hostages in Burkina FasoComment: The only thing that can save the wretched Tory party now is a grassroots guerrilla warComment: The French are welcome to Land Rover – ever since it got rid of the Defender, the wheels have fallen offCould Amber Rudd\u0026#39s attack on the Tory \u0026#39parade of wives\u0026#39 mean a leadership pact with Boris Johnson?Temporary Parliament \u0026#39extravagant, time wasting and destructive\u0026#39, say heritage campaigners and architectsChina accused of secret lobbying campaign in UK against its critics Two rogue police officers who sabotaged child abuse cases ditched work to have four-hour lunch breakSajid Javid says he is attacked daily online by Asians and the \u0026#39far Left\u0026#39 because he is not \u0026#39brown enough\u0026#39Davina McCall: gyms need to be more like Narcotics Anonymous sessions and help newcomers feel welcomeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/17/09/hamleys.jpg","title":"hamleys toy store sold mukesh ambani india richest man reliance","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as admission to the game for two people, the package included travel and hotel, as well as spending money for during the trip.In the emails sent out to customers, and addressed with their name, they were told they had actually won that prize, and should get in touch to get hold of it. Numerous people who receive the email say they believed it to be true, and some even claim to have already started making preparations for the trip.But it quickly became clear the message had been sent to a huge number of Zavvi\u0027s customers. Only one person will get the tickets, it has since confirmed, and so receiving the email does not mean anything at all.We’re extremely sorry to have got our loyal customers’ hopes up, however due to human error a mistake was made with our mail-out and unfortunately there is only one winner of the tickets, a spokesperson said.Created with Sketch.

He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”Mr Hughes admits that he and other members of the early Facebook team should have done more to ensure that the site couldn’t be abused to “change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders”.But he says that the only way to bring that power into check now might be for the government to intervene and break up Facebook. Recent attempts to constrain the power of the company do not go far enough, he wrote, and the only way to keep the domination of Facebook in check is to force it to stop having such a vast power over the internet.“We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,” the article reads. “Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American.”Specifically, Mr Hughes argues that the company should be separated into different companies. The US government could also revoke the 2012 acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp so that they will return to functioning independently, he writes.“The cost of breaking up Facebook would be next to zero for the government, and lots of people stand to gain economically,” he said. “A ban on short-term acquisitions would ensure that competitors, and the investors who take a bet on them, would have the space to flourish. Digital advertisers would suddenly have multiple companies vying for their dollars.”In calling for such an intervention, Mr Hughes adds to a growing a number of voices in US politics who have argued that the only way to limit Facebook’s power is to break it up. Politicians including senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren have called for more regulation on the social network, and has been joined by voices across the ideological spectrum, including Ted Cruz.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is, the company says, the biggest problem with wearing shoes, and bad fit leads to uncomfortable sneakers, worse performance, and people returning shoes or just simply not deciding to buy new ones. And now Nike says, that widespread problem – attested to by unworn shoes found around people\u0027s houses, and blisters and blood on people\u0027s feet – is fixed.It says it has done so with the invention of a new app that will encourage people not to pick shoes by selecting a number, but instead scanning their feet. By using a phone\u0027s camera, the new app will gather a full picture of the size of your foot – and then use that to decide which shoe to send you.Eventually, Nike thinks we might be able to do away with sizes entirely,\u0026nbspwith shoes instead turning up at your door without a number or gender written on them, and instead with just your name. But for now, the company wants to change how you get to that size.While shoes have changed in a variety of unrecognisable ways, the fundamental way that they\u0027re fitted to your feet hasn\u0027t altered much since the 14th century. Back then, cobblers would grab hold of a piece of equipment called a last, built to represent a foot, and sew up the material to make the shoe around it so that it would fit to people\u0027s feet.Those shoes eventually formed into a standard size, which remains in place as the numbers used across the world today. That all happened\u0026nbspso long ago that they are based on the dimensions of a kernel of barleycorn.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

The sewing might be done by machines and the lasts might be made out of the latest materials, but the way they are fitted around the feet and the numbers used to describe that fit is unchanged.Nike says it has improved the shoe so good it became controversialIt is a process prone to error: most people are in the wrong sized shoes. More than a quarter of shoes come back to stores because they don\u0027t fit, and Nike thinks that the number is actually probably even higher when it accounts for the people who simply go on wearing badly fitted sneakers, or don\u0027t ever wear them at all.That leads to a whole variety of problems. Rubbing, blisters and blood will all be familiar\u0026nbspto just about anyone who has ever worn shoes for athletes, it can mean not just pain but poor performance, since shoes are built to fit precisely onto the foot.Nike founder Bill Bowerman, for instance, was famous for ripping apart standard shoes and resewing them to fit around the feet of the athletes he was training. Shoe companies have been trying to do the same on a broader level ever since, though the problem has stayed largely the same.The technology currently\u0026nbspused to try and fix that problem is decades old in itself. In Nike stores around the world – and just about every other shoe shop – the piece of machinery known as a Brannock Device tries to assess people\u0027s feet by pushing sliders around to measure them at their widest and their longest, but that in itself can lead to badly fitting shoes.Nike thinks that has been fixed by the new technology known as Fit. It uses a phone\u0027s camera to scan the feet, combines that with augmented reality technology to understand just how big they are, and then feeds that into its vast array of data about the shoes that it makes.It thinks that technology is not simply going to make shoes fit better, by taking into account the precise dimensions of the foot and the lacing, fit, stitching and materials of the shoe. It thinks it could fundamentally alter the way people buy shoes, and make the traditional barleycorn-based measurements out of date.Size is a lie, Nike says. And it claims its new app is ready to tell you the truth.The new feature will appear initially inside of the Nike app, as well as in a slightly different experience in stores. But both rely on the same basic principles, if they are presented in different ways.When it launches, anyone heading into the app to buy shoes will be presented with the normal list of sizes when they do. But they\u0027ll also be told about Nike Fit, alongside a button offering them the option to try it.Pressing that will open up the camera and a whole host of instructions. They\u0027ll be told to allow the phone to scan their floor so it can get a sense of proportion. After that they\u0027ll stand next to the wall and simply point the shoe at their foot.At that point, the phone starts doing its work. It uses computer vision to scan the foot – using only the camera of the camera and the capabilities of the app – and then combines that with data science to scan the foot and read what it says are dozens of different datapoints about the size of your feet.Once it has those measurements, offering a precise picture of your foot morphology, it is fed into a machine learning model that is learning how feet are sized over time. By combining that information about your feet with all of Nike\u0027s information about its shoes, it can compare the two and decide what shoe size you actually need.That measurement might vary with the shoes it might even be different for alternative versions of the shoe, because of the way the materials work. (This writer\u0027s feet were generally a size above what had been expected, and had a range of a range of three different sizes for different shoes.) The measurement might even vary between your feet, with one slightly larger than the other, and in the future it could be possible to have differently sized inidual shoes to match.Getting this wrong could be very bad indeed. A huge number of people already suffer with wrongly sized shoes – and if the app got them even more wrong, then it could simply exacerbate the problem it was created to fix.Nike says it is confident it will work because it has been testing it in stealth mode for months. Some select Nike Stores have quietly swapped out the traditional Brannock Devices for the app, allowing the company to gather feedback and look at how the measurements match up.We\u0027ve had true measurable results that\u0027s inspiring confidence,\u0026nbspsays Adam\u0026nbspSussman, Nike\u0027s vice president and general manager for Nike Direct Digital and Geographies. That\u0027s why we also feel really comfortable going out with this so broadly so quickly because the results are pretty astonishing especially when you compare it to the results that you get with with a Brannock device.It will keep collecting that data as the app goes into use, rapidly collecting unprecedented amounts of data about the size of people\u0027s feet. (Nike says it takes the responsibility of storing that data extremely seriously, and that people will be able to remove it from their account if they desire.) It says that data will be fed back throughout the company, a process that could lead to new shoe designs or sizes.At the moment, the primary reason not to innovate\u0026nbspfurther and faster is a concern for consumers. People have lived with the traditional shoe sizing system for centuries – and it wil be a tough thing to change with a click of a camera and an app update.There is a consumer journey, and\u0026nbspyou have to bring the consumers along with you, says Sussman.\u0026nbspBut you can see it as completely redefining how you purchase the right product for you.Nike is aware that this could all be a little stressful. One way of trying to alleviate that is that\u0026nbspthe app actually slows down the process of scanning your feet and shows a readout that is strictly unnecessary, just so that people can see it is doing something. That was part of a commitment to ensuring that the app was simple and non-intimidating no matter how complicated the underlying technology was, says Nike\u0027s Josh Moore, who led the design of the app.It\u0027s not the first time that Nike has introduced such new features into its app, or those based on augmented reality, which\u0026nbspis used heavily in its SNEAKRS app. The company used lessons\u0026nbsplearned from the introduction of those feautres to inform the new release, Moore said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the future, with even more work and more feedback, that could develop into new ways of understanding shoe size – or giving it up completely.I think there\u0027s some things that we have clear line of path or visibility to, says\u0026nbspSussman. And then there\u0027s some things that we don\u0027t even know where this could take us.That future could include shoes that are in some way post-size: not based on gender or barleycorns, but just chosen by a computer to fit as snugly as required around your feet. Nike has already experimented with abandoning size – it offered its Presto shoes in small, medium and large, which was neat but didn\u0027twork for more performance-focused shoes – and this new feature could be the leap forward required to take the numbers of boxes and replace them instead with your name.I believe that there\u0027s a way a view into the into the future that\u0027s not so distant from a technological standpoint that we can get there, says Sussman.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re just going to say: this is the right shoe for you.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She completed her final project as laureate – a collection by various poets responding to the collapse in the insect population – and the 10th anniversary of her laureateship passed on 1 May. No successor had been chosen. The DCMS blamed the delay\u0026nbspon the government’s preoccupation with other issues.Created with Sketch.28 of the most powerful lines of poetry ever written Show all 28Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.128 \u0027Because I could not stop for Death\u0027, Emily DickinsonBecause I could not stop for Death,  He kindly stopped for me  The carriage held but just ourselves  And Immortality And when wind and winter harden  All the loveless land,  It will whisper of the garden,  You will understand 328 \u0027Variation on the Word Sleep\u0027, Margaret AtwoodI would like to be the air  that inhabits you for a moment  only.

Among the most notable laureates include William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Ted Hughes. Duffy was the first woman, the first Scot, and the first openly gay or bisexual poet to hold the position. The position grants an annual stipend of £5,750 and a “butt of sack”, which is equivalent to about 600 bottles of sherry.Not everyone believes the position to be an enviable one, whether for political or creative reasons.Thomas Gray, Samuel Rogers and Walter Scott all turned down the laureateship, while Wendy Cope and Benjamin Zephaniah have both emphatically ruled themselves out in recent years.\u0026nbspIf it’s a competition, it is one that many poets have no interest in winning,” Cope said, while Zephaniah, who has spoken on several occasions about his opposition to the policies, principles and legacy of the monarchy, commented: “I have absolutely no interest in this job. I won’t work for them. They oppress me, they upset me, and they are not worthy.”Others have suggested the role is creatively oppressive. Andrew Motion, who was laureate from 1999 to 2009, called the role “very, very damaging to my work”, saying while still in post: “I dried up completely about five years ago and can’t write anything except to commission.”\u0026nbspIn his letter for  about his outgoing role as poet laureate, Motion also complained about news editors\u0027 tendency to find\u0026nbspsomeone who didn’t like his latest work, “then they had their story: ‘Poet laureate writes another no-good poem.’” He noted that this frustrated John Betjeman to the point that he considered resigning, while Ted Hughes also complained about the same occurrence.\u0026nbsp“My point is not simply that the response is tiresome for whoever happens to be laureate,” Motion wrote. “The point is: it\u0027s bad for poetry in general - but journalists apparently have some difficulty (or, more likely, no interest) in grasping this. Indeed, when I tried to talk about it six months ago, I was widely reported as saying that I thought the whole business of being laureate was \u0027thankless\u0027.\u0026nbspThe most powerful lines of poetry ever writtenThe Independent’s favourite poems from Robert Burns to WB Yeats“What I actually said was: the business of feeling obliged to write royal poems is thankless, because however good or bad they might be, the poems that result are always likely to be held up for mockery, and to make poetry suffer in the process. Why? Because they turn poetry into a kind of Aunt Sally –\u0026nbspsomething the media needs little encouragement to do –\u0026nbspby making it look ridiculous and out of touch with normal life.”“The laureateship requires experience and dignity,” the newly crowned Armitage wrote for  last year, when the search for a new poet laureate was still ongoing. “We’re not looking to appoint the mayor of Toytown or a mascot for our everyday aspirations. Or someone who has published four books, sits on five committees, has judged six prizes and is a nice person, or someone who is a shop-steward for contemporary values first and a poet second (or third).“If you’re still in the running at this stage, you also need to be someone who will get out from behind the keyboard and the dusty tomes, come down from the ivory tower or the sunlit garret or the senior common room, and be prepared to go into the schools, prisons, communities and hospices. In fact, you will probably have been doing that for thirty years. And you should happily go to the theatres and festivals and nightclubs to see and hear live poetry being spoken and performed.

Known as geoengineering, such futuristic techniques could become a reality if scientists manage to figure out a way of implementing them.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Act now or swim later - Children

reflect heat back into space.Another proposal is “re-greening” and “greening” areas of the planet with vegetation, on sea and on land, to remove carbon dioxide from the air.In October the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that changes on an unprecedented scale would be needed by society to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.I used to ignore environmental issues – but now I’m making up for itClimate change could ‘force UK residents to abandon their towns’The panel said countries need to cut carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and to net zero by 2050, with steep cuts in other greenhouse gases such as methane. The IPCC said methods to take excess carbon out of the atmosphere, known as carbon capture, will also be needed.A poll by YouGov at the time found that a majority of Britons would be happy to reduce their consumption of resources to slow or halt the negative effects of climate change.One in three preferred an approach that relies on technological solutions to counter climate change.Additional reporting by Press AssociationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His poems are known for incorporating slang\u0026nbspand sardonic wit as well as being easily accessible to younger readers.Born in Marsden, West Yorkshire, Armitage worked as a probation officer in Greater Manchester before focusing on poetry. He currently sits as the Oxford professor of poetry.Prime minister Theresa May said of the new poet laureate: “As one of our most popular and respected poets, Simon brings a wealth of expertise and experience to this important role.“He is well placed to attract even more people into the literary world, and further enhance our nation’s proud tradition of producing exceptional poetry.”Culture secretary Jeremy Wright said: “Simon\u0026nbspArmitage\u0026nbspis one of the UK’s foremost poets, whose witty and profound take on modern life is known and respected across the world.“He has done so much to promote poetry, and I am sure he will use the laureateship to continue this work.”The UK’s first poet\u0026nbsplaureate was John Dryden, who was given the title by King Charles II\u0026nbspin 1668. Previous poet laureates, who initially served until their death until a rule change in 1999,\u0026nbspinclude\u0026nbspWilliam Wordsworth, John Betjeman and Ted Hughes.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s even got this post-hook of drums — I wanted them to sound like Dothraki drums.”Created with Sketch. Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die.

This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”“‘I Did Something Bad’ I wrote after Arya and Sansa conspire to kill Littlefinger. That and ‘Look What You Made Me Do,’ have “Cersei vibes, too.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The adviser added: “Our message is clear: a solution must have been found by October 31.”The senior official did not categorically rule out a further extension, and expressed hope that talks between the government and the Labour Party would provide a workable majority for Theresa May to get her deal through parliament. “Maybe European elections\u0026nbspwill serve as a shock to reach a transpartisan deal,” they added.UK minister accuses Europeans of ‘lazy thinking’ about BrexitBut with no obvious road out of the crisis in sight, some in Brussels are now considering the prospect that the UK might stay after all.\u0026nbspIn a separate interview with Polish newspaper\u0026nbspGazeta Wyborcza, European Council president Donald Tusk suggested the door was still open for Britain to remain.“After the British referendum in 2016, I thought that if we recognise that the case is closed, it will be the end. Today the chance that Brexit will not happen is, in my opinion, 20 to 30\u0026nbspper cent. That’s a lot,” he said. “From month to month, it is becoming increasingly clear that the UK’s exit from the EU will look completely different than the Brexit that was promoted. I see no reason to capitulate.”As an EU member state, France has a veto over any extension to Article 50, though in practice the leaders on the European Council have tended to find a\u0026nbspmidpoint compromise\u0026nbspwhen faced with dissenting voices.Earlier this year Emmanuel Macron was thought to be responsible for the length of the current extension to 31 October\u0026nbspfollowing the summit, officials in the room reported that most\u0026nbspother member states wanted an even longer delay until March 2020, or would have had no objection to one.Mr Macron was said to be pushing for an even shorter\u0026nbspextension of a matter of weeks, but ultimately met the other member states in the middle to approve the Halloween deadline.EU leaders are mostly taking a holiday from Brexit at the moment, avoiding discussion of Britain’s departure at a meeting in the city of Sibiu, Romania, which took place on Thursday.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThey are, however, expected to return to the issue at a long-scheduled\u0026nbspJune meeting of the European Council, where a limited appraisal of the situation\u0026nbspis expected to be held.It is understood that other member states also have concerns about a further extension past October, because of the uncertainty it would put upon the European Union.

Somebody younger and more vulnerable.Responding to Mr Burgon\u0027s comments the Labour MP Darren Jones - a supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign - said: No serious political party exists just because of Brexit but there is no escape from the reality that the issue of how or whether we leave the EU overshadows everything in British politics politics today.He continued: The overwhelming majority of Labour MP, Labour members, and Labour voters, including in traditional Labour areas, want the party to support the public being given a Final Say on Brexit.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s past time for the leadership of the Labour Party to stop ducking and ing on this crucial issue and start standing up for the people who elected them.Mr Burgon\u0026nbspadded that\u0026nbspLabour would not walk away lightly from the cross-party talks with the government but he was getting more and more concerned that actually negotiating with this prime minister isn\u0027t as straightforward as some might hope because she is actually negotiating with her own side continually.He said he wanted the parties to agree a traditional British compromise.During the interview, Mr Burgon also insisted he certainly\u0026nbspdid not lie following a row last month after a clip emerged of him claiming that Zionism is the enemy of peace in 2014.He had previously denied making the comment in an interview with the BBC, and faced calls to apologise\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspthe video surfaced last month showing him saying the exact remarks.Repeatedly pressed on the issue by BBC Newsnight, he said: I forgot a phrase that it turns out I used half a decade ago, before I was an MP.He added that he regretted the remarks, which were an oversimplification, but added: I didn\u0027t lie.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will look to broadcast this episode at a later date.”Fans of the show expressed their frustration on Twitter, with many pointing out that the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage had appeared on Question Time on Thursday evening.Author Emma Kennedy wrote: “Heidi Allen isn’t standing as an MEP. And BBCQT had Farage on last night. Who is standing as an MEP. SO EXPLAIN THAT.”The BBC made clear the decision related to entertainment programmes. As Richard Osman, presenter of BBC quiz show Pointless pointed out, “comedy shows find impartiality and equal screen time far trickier than news programmes in the lead-up to all elections”.After tweeting a photo of her name on a dressing room door, Ms Allen shared her confusion, revealing she had not been told about the decision.“Maybe I’m just not as funny as Nigel\u0026nbspFarage\u0026nbspeh … !? He’s so funny, he seems to be on the BBC all the time! An explanation would be appreciated, not least to acknowledge the hard work of the entire crew who worked diligently to put the show together,” added the Change UK leader.She later called the decision “very odd and very disappointing”.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyThe government confirmed earlier this week that the election of MEPs\u0026nbspto the European parliament will go ahead on May 23.Friday night’s episode of HIGNFY\u0026nbspwas replaced with Would I Lie to You?, which should have aired afterwards.Have I Got News For YouThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if the person serving you on the other side of the counter is young, they could be on half the wage of their colleagues.He will continue: It\u0027s time to end this discrimination. Young people’s work should be properly valued, not exploited by employers to cut their wage bill. If they’re doing the job, pay them the wage – the Real Living Wage.\u0026nbspFor a 16-year-old currently on the minimum wage, what I’m announcing today will mean a pay rise from £4.35 an hour this year under a Tory government, to £10 an hour next year under Labour – more than double. For the average 16-17-year-old in employment, that will make them more than £2,500 a year better off.Imagine what that will do for the lives of young people, especially those from poorer backgrounds. It will be nothing less than life changing.”Responding to the announcement, the Conservative vice chairman for policy\u0026nbspChris Philp, claimed:\u0026nbsp You can’t trust Labour on the economy or on their promises to young people.“The last Labour government saw the number of young people without a job rise to almost one\u0026nbspmillion and Jeremy Corbyn’s reckless approach to the economy would see the next generation saddled with higher levels of debt and higher taxes.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Taylor Bland-Ball and Joshua McAdams’ three year old son has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The family was concerned about the side effects of chemotherapy, which include fatigue, hair loss, nausea, and appetite changes, on the young child, and thus expressed interest in alternative treatments including medical marijuana, alkaline dieting, and vitamin therapy.The young boy reportedly received one session of chemotherapy at the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. After that session, his parents stopped appearing for their scheduled appointments. The family was found in Kentucky after an endangered child search was put out in search of their young son. Ms Bland-Ball and Mr McAdams said they had only left Florida to find a second opinion in Ohio.Created with Sketch.WWE: Roman Reigns returns to announce leukaemia is in remission Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.17 Romen Reigns returns to WWERoman Reigns made an emotional return to the WWE on Monday night27 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns looked visibly touched by the huge reaction.37 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns returned to announce that his leukaemia was in remission.47 Romen Reigns returns to WWEThe crowd chanted Reigns\u0027 name as he enjoyed the emotional moment.57 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns celebrated his return with fans at ringside.67 Romen Reigns returns to WWEHe embraced his mother who was at ringside to watch the special moment.77 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns was embraced by   close friend Seth Rollins.17 Romen Reigns returns to WWERoman Reigns made an emotional return to the WWE on Monday night27 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns looked visibly touched by the huge reaction.37 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns returned to announce that his leukaemia was in remission.47 Romen Reigns returns to WWEThe crowd chanted Reigns\u0027 name as he enjoyed the emotional moment.57 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns celebrated his return with fans at ringside.67 Romen Reigns returns to WWEHe embraced his mother who was at ringside to watch the special moment.77 Romen Reigns returns to WWEReigns was embraced by   close friend Seth Rollins.As a result of leaving the state and ceasing treatment, the couple’s son was removed from their custody and is currently living with his grandparents. Ms Bland-Ball and Mr McAdams are allowed supervised visitation during chemotherapy treatments, and are working on obtaining unsupervised visitation rights. US teacher with cancer forced to pay for her own substituteJudge Caroline Tesche Arkin said the family was welcome to use these alternative treatments, including medical marijuana which is legal in the state, in supplement to chemotherapy for their son, but the family must complete at least a 28 day course of chemotherapy as the primary treatment option.Ms Bland-Ball said that her husband and herself were disappointed, but their case really opened up a good discussion on parental rights, about patient rights.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered local governments to prevent any more industrial disasters after a chemical plant blast left 47 people dead, injured hundreds and flattened an industrial park in the latest such catastrophe to hit the country“If we break down where turnout has gone up, it appears this has happened in a lot of urban and particularly newly urban areas,” Mr Mrug said.“Previous Indian elections have been all about rural voters, they were seen as having all the clout in decision making. This turnout among the aspirational classes, those moving in order to try and climb the social ladder, shows an attempt to carve out a new space on the political map.”The BJP has struggled in the last year to combat the perception that it has let down farmers – a demographic shift giving greater clout to urban voters, Mr Mrug said, might not be bad news for Mr Modi.Speaking at an event for foreign reporters in Delhi on Friday, the BJP’s defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “Our assessment is we are coming back and we are coming back with a good majority.”\u0026nbspShe said the party’s tactic since the turn of the year of focusing the conversation on national security, and away from the government’s disappointing jobs creation and farmers’ rights records, was proving fruitful.Before voting began, most analysts predicted that Mr Modi would be returning for a second term, albeit with a reduced majority.Woman who accused India Chief Justice of sexual harassment ‘terrified’Gandhis face stern reelection test as India goes to pollsIndia demands Pakistan be punished after UN lists ‘global terrorist’Millionaires and Bollywood stars vote alongside Mumbai slum-dwellersTikTok ban in India overturned after reassurances over porn videosBut that is not to say that a BJP victory is guaranteed. The government is facing an opposition that is much better organised and more\u0026nbspcoordinated than it was in 2014, with tighter alliances and united “anyone-but-Modi” messaging.One analysis by a leading Indian newspaper, the Hindustan Times, has argued that while the BJP wanted high turnout nationwide, the biggest spikes have been in states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh which saw dejected Congress voters stay away in 2014.Their return could be a problem for Mr Modi, given these two populous states alone offer 54 seats in parliament. In the first half of the election, Madhya Pradesh’s turnout this time was 74.9 per cent – up a full 10 percentage points from 64.9 per cent in 2014.Congress spokesperson\u0026nbspSanjay Jha said negotiations among opposition parties to finalise an alliance that offers a “viable alternative” to BJP government were still going on and a deal would be reached before the election results are announced on 23 May.“We’ve all collectively recognised the reality that the BJP is losing significant votes, therefore we are mutually exploring the formation of a cohesive and durable government that will fulfil the aspirations of India,” Mr Jha said.Congress and other opposition parties believe they have successfully maintained their focus on issues including farmer distress and an unemployment rate that, according to leaked figures, is at its worst in decades, despite media coverage that has mostly focused on personal insults between leaders.\u0026nbspThe Supreme Court dismissed a petition filed by a BJP member of parliament which called for an investigation into unfounded claims that Rahul Gandhi, the congress leader, held British citizenship. Holding dual nationality is against the law in India.And at a huge rally this week in Delhi, which sees all seven of its constituencies up for grabs on Sunday as one of the key regions polling in phase six, Mr Modi again lashed out at the legacy of Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister assassinated in 1992 and father of current congress leader Rahul Gandhi.The elder Mr Gandhi had abused an Indian aircraft carrier for a “Gandhi family vacation”, Mr Modi suggested, two days after he sparked controversy by telling Rahul Gandhi “your father ended his life as India’s most corrupt man”.National security, anti-corruption, the congress party as a vehicle for one family – the statements by Mr Modi and his ministers this week show the BJP is sticking to its guns to the end.The pitch of public debate over the course of the election has been “acrimonious”, bemoaned the pollster Mr Mrug. “However much it would have been better for democracy to have the election fought on the issues, it’s ultimately turning out to be an election fought on personalities,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heidi Allen, , was the Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire before she left the party on February . After quitting the Tories she will still represent the constituency, but as an independent MP. Ms Allen was elected at the  general election.She also stood for the role of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayor.But she failed to make the final round of the internal selection process after a vote by local party members in January .She was re-elected in the snap General Election of .Along with two other MPs, she quit the Conservative Party to join the new Change UK group in a major blow to Theresa Mays authority.She joined Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston in their defection, hitting out at the Prime Ministers disastrous handling of Brexit as they quit.The three - who will join the eight ex-Labour MPs who have formed Change UK - claimed Mrs May had failed to stand up to the hard line European Research Groupof Brexiteers.The May  episode of the BBC programme was cancelled because they had booked the Change UK MP.A post from the programmes Twitter account said the show was pulled because of upcoming elections to the European Parliament.A BBC spokesperson confirmed: The BBC has specic editorial guidelines that apply during election periods.Because of this it would be inappropriate to feature political party leaders on entertainment programmes during this short election period, which does not allow for equal representation to be achieved.So we will not broadcast the scheduled episode of HIGNFY featuring Heidi Allen, leader of Change UK.We will look to broadcast this episode at a later date.Ms Allen has strongly advocated remaining in the EU. She is calling for a People’s Vote over Brexit.As a backbencher she has voiced strong views against Brexit, often rebelling against the Prime Ministers government.She has previously talked of quitting the Tories should there be a prospect of a hard Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000477133484.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry birth misled","story":"A couple of weeks ago, that most “woke” of royal couples, Meghan and Harry, made a self-important statement to say there would be no statement about the forthcoming birth of the  squillionth in line to the throne.The nation stopped what they were doing for a moment, muttered “Yer what ” then gave a collective shrug and carried on trying to pay the bills.Then came yesterday’s weird stage management of what could have been a simple “They’ve had a healthy baby boy” statement made at a time that suited them.Instead, at pm, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duchess of Sussex was “in labour” then,  minutes later, followed it up with the news that it was a lb oz boy who, it later transpired, had arrived in the world in the early hours of that morning.So why the smoke and mirrors nonsense  It begs the question: If they put out misinformation about something so innocent, why should we believe what they say in any future statements As the old saying goes, “Don’t start drama and then say you hate drama”.Prince Harry has a special place in our hearts for many reasons, but particularly because he lost his mother at such a young age and was forced by royal duty to walk behind her coffin in full view of the world — a move that, today, seems even more unthinkable than it did then.So it’s understandable that he wanted to keep that most private of moments — the birth of his first child — out of the public gaze for a few precious hours. Fair enough.Equally, no one was much bothered whether or not Meghan came out on the steps of a hospital  seconds after giving birth. Each to their own and all that.But being Hollywood-style “woke” means you can’t just quietly get on with it and let your actions speak for themselves.No, you have to make grand declarations about your right-on credentials, such as “climate change is a very important issue” or “racism is abhorrent” as , by not making such virtue-signalling statements, the rest of us disagree and need to be enlightened.And so, rather than just announcing the birth when it suited them, they issued a rather pompous and bewildering press release to tell us in advance that they wanted to “keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private”.Asthe Press and public were constantly banging on the door of their easily accessible, terraced house, demanding to knowlittle Wayne or Waynetta had arrived yet.This push-back, following as it did the very public ghosting of Meghan’s father Thomas, risked alienating those members of the public with a genuine fondness for the prince and his new we.But happily, all the nonsense was forgotten the moment Harry bounded in to the stables area at Windsor Castle, where a select few of the world’s media were assembled.As the horses behind him gazed disinterestedly into the middle distance, his obvious delight at becoming a father was written all over his face.This was the Labrador puppy-esque Harry of old, and thanks to his excellent “How women do that is beyond comprehension” remark, he’s now firmly reinstated as the uncomplicated, cheeky chappie we all have a soft spot for.So, a heartfelt congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of their first child.And moving forward, perhaps a little less of the stage-management and self-important virtue-signalling would be wise.In other words, take a leaf out of our admirable Queen’s book and just show us what you’re made of, rather than tell.PRINCESS CHARLOTTE celebrated her fourth birthday last week with a party at Kensington Palace.One can only imagine what a hot ticket that was at her primary school.Not among the children, silly. I mean the parents.The fevered anticipation at school pick-up time must have been palpable.Is there a gilt-edged stfyin the backpack or not Should they wait until they’re in the car before looking Or should they just fall to their knees in the playground right now for a spot of desperate, unseemly rummaging In the event, Prince William described it as “a rowdy party” which suggests that he and Kate swerved any potential breach of social etiquette by inviting the whole class. Phew.But of course, small children, the elderly or infirm would have had no chance in the face of such disastrous selfishness.QUEEN the band are now richer than our actual monarch following the worldwide success of their movie Bohemian Rhapsody.Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are the brains behind the biopic, which focuses on former frontman Freddie Mercury, who died in .But perhaps the smartest of them all is bassist John Deacon, who, despite being asked to be involved in the planning and production of the movie, didn’t even reply to the email – preferring to live a non-famous, quiet le in West London with his we and kids.While still benefiting from the enormous royalty cheques, of course.SO let’s get this straight. Former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked from his post based on accusations from people unknown and “evidence” he’s not allowed to see.This Government is getting more like the Stasi with each passing day.EMMA THOMPSON has been branded a “first class hypocrite” after lecturing the rest of us on climate change then hopping on a commercial jet.Was she on a mercy mission to the socialist haven of Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis has resulted in violence and helpless families being wracked by poverty and death Nope, thought not. She was on her way to New York for business meetings.But hey, do as I say, not as I do. Isn’t that the luvvie way The surreptitiously taken photo of her in seat F was accompanied by exquisite detail of her Laurent-Perrier champagne and beef carpaccio consumption.And according to one report, her share of the carbon dioxide generated by the flight was “the same as that emitted by heating an average house for nine months”.While I could extrapolate for hourson climate change data and its possible outcomes and solutions, I instead find my attention drting towards the more compelling conundrum of . . . who nobbled Dame Emma at ,ft Given that the first-class compartment of the BA jet only seats , it has all the makings of an excellent TV mystery in which all the exits are sealed, Miss Marple comes on board, and the perpetrator is eventually unmasked.Except, in this case, they’d be a national hero.STRICTLY dancer Katya Jones has reportedly been demoted from having a celeb pairing in the next series because her snog with last year’s partner Seann Walsh was deemed “unprofessional” by BBC bosses. Yet there she is, currently strutting her stuff on the nation’s theatre stages as part of the brand’s offshoot tour called . . . Strictly Come Dancing: The Professionals.Go figure.DANIEL CRAIG’s hunky stuntman has been causing a few hot flushes among the nation’s menopausal women .Jean-Charles Rousseauhas been photographed on location in Jamaica, where filming has started on “Bond ”, as it’s currently known.He was driving a Land Rover, but quite how many other stunts he will perform on Mr Craig’s behalf remains to be seen.Meanwhile, it reminds me of the incorrigible Sir Roger Moore who, when I asked whether he used stuntmen during his time as Bond, replied: “Yes, but I did all my own love scenes.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was Tories specically.Indeed the new fly-on-the-wall EU documentary is a revealing portrait of the pompous, sneering, undemocratic bureaucrats .million of us voted to leave: mocking Brexit, our country, even our “war spirit”. That’s right, the war spirit that served us well as we helped to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny.But for an insight into Verhofstadt’s blinkered stupidity look no further than a remark he made only yesterday.Turkey, he said, was “drting towards dictatorship” as its president orders the re-run of an election he lost.Precisely as Brussels does with its own defeats and is desperate to do with Brexit.WHAT is going through Theresa May’s mind  She cannot rescue this.Brexit deadlines come and go. More are set. Empty promises are made. They’ll be broken too.Her party and country are baying for her to step down. Her aides threaten legal action against her own MPs — as she tries to stitch up a deal with Corbyn neither his party nor hers will back.This utter shambles would be catastrophic enough for the Government without Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. But, as predicted, he is hoovering up Tory voters, members and maybe donors.This existential threat can only be fought under a new leader. Those closest to the PM should talk sense to her.WE reluctantly accept, as the Government has, that our High Streets need to be ­reinvented in the online shopping era.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire rightly says we cannot “turn the clock back”.Many stores cannot compete with the convenience and lower cost of buying on the web. If that means town and city centres becoming a mass of restaurants, hairdressers and nail bars combined with welcome new housing, well, so be it.But it’s rich for a Government to throw up its hands. It’s politicians, via obscene business rates and parking charges, who helped wreck stores’ ability to compete.How can ANY High Street business survive those Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And right across Europe it is the new populist parties which will hold the whip hand come May . Electors are furious about uncontrolled immigration, tired of the bureaucratic EU and sick to the back teeth of social liberalism.Like never before they are backing the populists, in countless countries across the continent. They already now run Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Estonia, having come from almost nothing ten years ago. But in these Euro elections the change will be even more dramatic.Across Scandinavia, in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, more and more electors are deserting the centre parties for what the BBC, holding its nose between two fingers, likes to call the “far Right”.Largely nationalist parties which care about national sovereignty and do not care for immigration. Sometimes radical socialist parties which resent the bullying EU.The centrist liberals of the European People’s Party and the socialists are likely to be routed, a response to decades of mismanagement and arrogance. For the first time EVER they are unlikely to hold an overall majority.And the numbers of populists making headway will be swelled by our own generous contribution — because Nigel Farage is marching back to Brussels — and his Brexit Party will secure at least a few dozen seats on May . This is an enormous problem for the current, discredited, EU leadership.One Brussels panjan- drum said it would lead to “institutional paralysis” within the EU. My response to that is: How will we tell  But he is probably right.The new parties are opposed to everything the current administration stands for. They are Eurosceptics. They wish the EU to be a trading bloc, not a supranational government telling every country what to do.They are largely socially conservative. They have little truck with the identity politics of the liberals. And they hate uncontrolled immigration. This will lead to an enormous upheaval in Brussels.They’ve woken up and smelled the coffee. The liberals know that their cards have been marked. But what Europe faces is a year or two of wrangling as these new parties seek to exert influence over the EU.And it will be made worse by the fact that the European People’s Party is itself split over what to do about immigration. A good proportion of EPP members have woken up and smelled the coffee.It’s all a bit ironic, isn’t it  Three years ago we voted to leave the EU — for many of the reasons that have led to this surge for the populists on the European mainland.If the populists can gain control of some of the EU’s institutions, it might become a much more palatable organisation for British people.Ah well. But one thing is for sure. In the UK, in the US, in Brazil and in the EU, liberalism has had its day. Good riddance.SO – she’s called the kid Archie Harrison.  I’m like, wtf  It’s not very regal, is it Sounds like the name of a combative left back for Middlesbrough in about . “Oh and a very robust tackle from Harrison there, which has left Smith needing stitches and possibly a kidney transplant.”I knew Harry wouldn’t have a say in the matter. Arthur and James were among the favourites, but I had a cheeky bet on Jayden and Lee.Anyway, despite being only three days old, the kid has already performed a hugely valuable service to this country. He’s moved Prince Andrew down from seventh in line to the throne to eighth.HUGE respect to Liverpool for their astonishing comeback against Barcelona.A brilliant performance and it is always fun to see Lionel Messi sick as a parrot suffering from severe gastroenteritis and feather rot.That cheeky corner. I want to see Millwall try it next season, and maybe develop the idea so we can actually have two balls on the pitch at the same time.RACHEL Weisz had better watch out.  Her husband Daniel Craig is to star opposite Ana de Armas in the next Bond flick.The pouting Cuban-Spanish moppet, has a habit of falling for her co-stars. Or becoming romantically involved with them in a deeply meaningful way, whatever.Listen Rach,he comes home smelling strongly of tapas, sling him out. IT’S that extravagant campfest, the Eurovision Song Contest, next week.It’s being held in Tel Aviv, Israel. And for months the pro-Palestine lobby has been demanding the whole event be boycotted.  Luckily, nobody has paid them any attention.And no word from the liberals, of course, on the  rockets fired into Israel by Hamas. Can you imagine, by the way, what would happenthe song contest was held in Palestine  Or indeed in any hardline Islamic state Half of the performers, all of the audience and most of the presenters would be terried they’d be pushed off the top of large buildings.BRITONS aren’t getting enough, apparently. The number of people who have sex at least once a week is down to record low levels.The experts think this is because of stuff like Netflix. We’re too busy watching Emilia Clarke in Game Of Thrones to give the missus a bit of a seeing to.What we need to do, then, is make sure everyone in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Africa get signed up to Netflix sharpish.That’s where you’ll find the world’s highest birth rates.If we can stop them having sex, the global population might stop its inexorable rise.EATING nuts while you are pregnant can improve the intelligence of your baby, apparently.  That’s the result of a new study.Yeah  So how come squirrels are so thick The number of nuts those furry little b******s get through, they should be inventing the theory of relativity and blasting off to the moon.Instead of sitting like idiots in trees and running away from dogs.THE former BBC presenter Gavin Esler has demanded TV news programmes stop putting on pro-Brexit people. The arrogant public school berk says he’s sick of hearing from “so-called” experts who support leaving the EU.OK, Gav. So how about some economic news  The UK is set to out- strip the entire eurozone, with the economy grow- ing THREE TIMES faster than Germany in the next year. Who says this  The European Commission.THE end of the London Marathon. The poor stewards have been at it all day. Hours and hours have dragged by and they want to go home, but still the tail-end charlies are straggling in.And so I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is it not quite understandable,not entirely within the spirit of the event, for a tired steward to shout out, in exasperation, as a fairly hefty competitor gasps and wheezes down The Mall: “Run, fatboy, run!”Yes, there is to be an investigation after Jack Glenny, , was subjected to this injunction.  And worse, when he finished, to be told snippily that he should have started at am.Jack was once on Big Brother and, because he was running for charidee, believes that nobody anywhere should have an unkind word to say against him.

On his head would be a top hat with the slogan: “Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug.”He squandered a fortune in £ election deposits and seldom attracted more than a handful of votes, although in a  county council election he beat two Labour candidates. He called the result: “A Loony landslide.”His policies  To reduce immigration, he wanted vast photographs of Russell Brand and Katie Hopkins erected at British airports. These, he argued, would so terry new arrivals that they would leg it on the first plane home.People with stutters should receive  per cent discounts on their t-t-t-telephone bills. To combat obesity, superglue should be added to lip salves. And anyone convicted of homophobia should have to serve their sentence in drag.On the face of it, poor Toby, like his late pal and party leader Screaming Lord Sutch, seemed a crackpot. That was the conventional verdict.But the longer you look at them, the less loopy Lords Jug and Sutch start to look. Were they possibly not more sane than many of our “real” politicians It’s not asJug smashed mobile phones against the wall , shaved the back of his hands Peter Mandelson, or travelled by sledge to the Arctic Circle for a photoshoot with huskies vain nincompoop David Cameron.And Toby Jug certainly missed a trick by never granny-dancing on to a party conference stage to the strains of Abba. We had to wait for “dependable” dullard Theresa May to do that.Mrs May or Lord Toby Jug: Which was more deserving of being carted away by the men in white coats Which was closer to the public’s views  Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug. And that was a better slogan, was it not, than Mrs May’s daft, delusional  General Election claim that she was “strong and stable” She croaked it like a demented parrot. “Strong and stable” turned out to be as truthful as some fruitcake who marches along your high street claiming to be the King of Prussia.Our politicians love to pose as shrewd sentries outside the nation’s coffers. They boast about their cleverness and financial acumen and yet they propose blowing £billion — more likely £billion, say sceptics — on a swanky new railway line that may reduce journey times between London and Birmingham by just a few minutes. Few voters want the HS line yet MPs press on with it. Nuts.Mrs May, who is forever lecturing the poor about how our tight public finances bind her hands on necessary spending, gaily proposes giving the EU a £billion cheque for almost nothing in .Does the House of Commons pin her down and ask her what the blazes she is doing  Nope.Who is the bonkers one here  It wasn’t Jug who, hoping to look virtuous, told police to reduce stop and search, a decision which was followed by a dreadful rise in kne murders of black kids. That was another crazy policy of the turbulent, scowling, almost catatonic T May.If you meet MPs, as we politics reporters must, you will hear them say that our PM “has lost it” and “needs help”. These are not poor-taste jibes about mental health. They genuinely believe Mrs May is unwell. Yet they will not remove her from an office in which she has command of our Armed Forces. Who’s pottier here  Mrs May, or the MPs who indulge her Take a look at the  General Election manesto of the Monster Raving Loony Party. One of its policies was: “We will introduce votes at .” They clearly thought that was a comically absurd idea. Today it is national policy in Scotland and is supported for the rest of the country by the Labour Party.Another  Monster Raving Loony proposalwas: “Solving the problem of over-crowding in prisons by releasing all innocent prisoners.”Our political class has gone one better than this. It has sought to solve prison crowding by releasing GUILTY prisoners.Then there was the Loonies’ idea to give House of Lords seats to: “Anyone who writes a problem page in a national newspaper.” Daft, of course. Instead, Labour gave a peerage to minor TV personalityAlan Sugar.The last gem from the  Loonies’ manesto was a promise to hold: “A referendum on whether people want a referendum on Europe.”Good joke — except that it has come horribly true. We were told our  EU referendum was a “once-in-a-letime” chance to decide whether or not to stay in the EU.Many MPs now want to block that poll’s Leave result and say it was merely a rehearsal for another referendum.Nurse, we need more straitjackets here!RIP, Lord Toby Jug.

This would mean you draw a line.“If the ICC agree, there can be this line in the sand drawn of a presumption of no prosecution after ten yearsno new evidence comes forward.“That I think would be an absolute positive step.“We then move forward from the ridiculous situation where people who have been retired for two or three decades are now having to scratch their heads as to what on earth happened in a particular incident on a particular evening.”Mr Ellwood said the ten-year limit would apply “across the board” but stressed that new evidence could allow a prosecution — a move he called “fair”.The legal bid is being driven by the MoD, the Northern Ireland Office and the Attorney General.Mr Ellwood added: “Absolutely we need to improve the investigations, which we are honouring purely because of the Good Friday Agreement.“This is going back before the Conservatives’ time — in recognising that there were some specic cases that families of those affected wanted to be looked into.“And it was on both sides of the equation, both on the terrorist side and some questions to do with British forces’ behaviour too.“What is unacceptable is  years after somebody has served you’re getting knocks on doors, and we need to move forward from that quickly.”Col Richard Kemp, ex-Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, said: “If the law is the reason these brave men are being hounded, the law must change.”And SAS hero Andy McNab said a time limit on bringing prosecutions was “the only logical way out”.The legal moves were revealed after Mr Mercer reignited the debate with his letter to Theresa May, sent on Wednesday.He said he was not prepared to vote for Government legislation, except on Brexit, until it took “clear and concrete steps” to end the “abhorrent process”.Mr Mercer has spoken out against the pursuit of legacy cases from the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iraq since entering Parliament in .But his intervention will be seen in Westminster as further evidence of the PM’s crumbling authority.Mr Mercer recently accused the Tory whips office of contacting former Army comrades in an effort to dig up dirt on him.He said it had left him feeling that his “values and ethos may be slowly, but very firmly, separating from a party I joined in ”.A spokesman said Mrs May is “fully aware of the strength of feeling” over the prosecutions, adding the system “needs to change to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors of the Troubles”.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt also said ending the hounding of troops was a “personal priority” for her.She said: “This has dragged on for far too long and it is time for action.”LAST Monday I got a phone call from Dennis Hutchings.

I didn’t know what to say.In  the Prime Minister spoke in her conference speech about ending the pursuit of our “brave men and women”. They are words which have made me wince every time I have heard them from a political leader in the last  years, because I know that they mean so very little.It was that precise injustice — the gap between words and actions from our political leaders towards those who have or are serving — that drove me to seek elected office despite never having voted before.Servicemen and women do not rally against the Government. Their professionalism, service, ethos and loyalty to the Crown prevent them. But they are angry. Very angry.Many veterans are not in Dennis’s health — they are worse. Some have dementia. Some do not even understand what is going on. I speak with their horried wives and children.I cannot accurately convey the seething injustice this represents as a way to treat those who have volunteered to protect and fight for the freedoms and privileges we have enjoyed in this nation over the years.The Government is capable of taking action and demonstrating leadership .There are options — for instance a ten-year time limitation before a “presumption not to prosecute” without compelling new evidence.And sometimes doing nothing is an option too. And that is a choice this administration has taken, and one which I cannot support.It has nothing to do with the wider Conservative Party. A good, modern, competent, centre-right, forward-looking Conservative Party would have sorted this some time ago.We are the party of Defence.

She’s offered to come and meet with the executive, and it would be strange for that not to result in a clear understanding at the end of the meeting.“We have asked a question. She’s coming, I assume, to answer it.”The latest thinking in Downing Street – revealed by James Forsyth in his Sun column today – would see Mrs May give the grandees a far smaller concession.Under the plan, the PM would pledge to the executive to resign as party leader as soon as her Brexit deal is passed, triggering a long summer leadership contest.After MPs whittle down the array of candidates to a final two, they would then tour the country to meet members for weeks.That may look the tallest of tall orders.But civil service preparations have made huge strides. The worst effects can be mitigated. Many Remainer MPs still spread panic about it, knowing only that they are meant to.The new Tory leader must back No Deal, or use the genuine threat of it to improve Mrs May’s deal with the EU.It is indeed the party’s only chance.The final debate between them would come at the Tories’ annual conference in October.Voting would then take place among the , members, with the new PM taking over in late October or November.Mrs May’s biggest Tory critics have threatened to try again next week to change the party’s rules to call a snap vote of confidence in her she fails to offer up a firm departure timetable.But Mr Coveney said their plan was doomed to fail as the EU would not accept any plan that hasn’t been tried and tested.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “These realities don’t change. It is not a personality-based issue, it is an evidence-based issue.“We have to move forward on the basis of knowing that we’re not going to see the kind of damage done on the island of Ireland that the imposition of a border would result in.”Brexiteers hate the Irish backstop, enshrined in the Withdrawal Agreement, as it could keep the UK tied to the EU for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, of course, she was with the prince by her daughter’s side when she gave birth.Normally the Queen is the first person to know of a new royal arrival, but this time Doria pipped her to the post.It is the first time a photo has shown the non-royal grandparent watching the Queen meet a new member of “The Firm” for the first time. And in another break with tradition, Doria was given a special mention when Buckingham Palace officially announced the baby’s birth on Monday.This suggests Doria, , will have a big role to play in Archie’s le and as a rock-like presence for Meghan.The Queen, like her grandson Harry, has a special affinity with Africa, both having spent extended periods on the continent during their twenties. She will likely appreciate the important role maternal grandmothers play in families with African heritage.Doria is an African-American grandmother who has raised a young woman of mixed heritage to be confident, strong and independent in the US, a country still coming to terms with its complicated racial history.The fact that Archie has such a erse family, from free-spirited yoga teacher Doria, right through to the Queen, will help him navigate the path in front of him. The baby ushered in an offshoot of our Royal Family that represents modern Britain where people of mixed race or dual heritage are the fastest-growing ethnic group.Archie bridges three continents: Europe, America and Africa, and the ability to help dferent groups of people find common ground will be really important in our future.By embracing change and adapting to the modern age, our Royal Family continues to occupy a place in the nation’s hearts.Archie will grow to be a young man familiar with the challenges we face in learning to live with dference, and he will be raised by people — such as Doria — who have done this successfully. In an interview, Doria’s stepmother, retired teacher Ava Burrows, said: “I’d assume she is going to be a hands-on grandmother. Historically in our culture, the mother worked long hours and needed support with her kids.“Grandmas usually live close together with the rest of the family, playing a big part raising their grandkids.“Doria is very important to Meghan. She’ll be a wonderful grandmother.”Doria was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in September . When she was a baby, her father Alvin, an antiques dealer, uprooted the family to Calornia. Soon after they settled in LA, Doria’s parents orced.Her father married Ava. He died after he tripped and hit his head on a kerb in .Doria was raised by her mother Jeanette, a shorthand typist. After leaving school Doria worked as a travel agent and later started a business selling clothes she made herself.In her early s she trained as a make-up artist and landed a job on the set of a TV soap, where she met and fell in love with Meghan’s dad Thomas, who she married.They orced when Meghan was six and Doria later worked as an air stewardess.Doria’s pet name for Meghan was “flower” and the pair shared a powerful bond.Describing her mum on her former blog The Tig, Meghan wrote: “Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free Spirit. Lover of potato chips and lemon tarts.“Andthe DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance, swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat.”She also wrote about how Doria imposed strict curfews when she was a teenager, taught her to cook Cajun shrimp gumbo and took her jogging and bike-riding.Perhaps Meghan will hope her mother will repeat all these activities with Archie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ben Shapiro cut short a Politics Live interview complaining this is a waste of time after he was quizzed repeatedly on his own past comments. And in an embarrassing error, he branded inquisitor Andrew Neil left-wing - even though Neil is one of Britainaposs most prominent right-leaning journalists, chairing aposTory Bibleapos magazine The Spectator. That led to humiliation for Mr Shapiro, who was told by his interviewer: If you only knew how ridiculous that statement is you wouldn’t have said it. Twitter users were quick to criticise the conservative pundit - mocking his interpretation of left-wing, branding him petulant and accusing him of a tantrum. Others meanwhile attacked the BBC for choosing to give him airtime.    Mr Shapiro got his apology in early, tweeting before the interview aired: Just pre-taped an interview with BBC’s Andrew Neil. As I’m not familiar with him or his work, I misinterpreted his antagonism as political Leftism– and that was apparently inaccurate. For that, I apologize. The row began when the interviewer quizzed Mr Shapiro on new hardline anti-abortion laws in the US state of Georgia. Mr Neil suggested a ban on abortions after six weeks that could jail women for  years was taking us back to the dark ages. Mr Shapiro fumed: Are you an objective journalist or are you an opinion journalist  Mr Neil replied: My job is to question those who have strong views and put an alternative to them.    If you were an anti abortion person I would be putting pro abortion questions to you. But the US pundit said: Why don’t you just say that you’re on the left  Is this so hard for you  Why canapost you just be honest  Mr Neil moved on to challenging Mr Shapiro about his past views. The pundit said in : “We’re above  million Muslims who are radicalised – more than half the Muslims on earth. That’s not a minority. And he tweeted in : Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage. Mr Neil accused him of coarsening public discourse.  But Mr Shapiro said it was the BBC that coarsened discourse, accusing his interviewer of trying to make a quick buck and adding: This is a waste of time. Iaposm popular and no one has ever heard of you, he huffed. I donapost frankly give a damn what you think of me since Iaposve never heard of you.

It refers to the super rich secretly moving their wealth offshore to protect it from a government they fear will close the growing chasm between them and the rest of us. It’s a euphemism for blatant tax avoidance and surely the only reason you need to vote Labour at the next election. Although, another one was revealed in a headline in yesterday’s Mirror“McVey latest to join Tory leadership scrum”. That’s right. Esther McVey, or Slasher McVile as she’s affectionately known in her hometown, has joined a battle of political giants like Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab, Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson trying to lt the keys to No from Theresa May’s pocket after they’ve cannibalised her corpse on European elections night. Not so much Game of Thrones as An Idiot’s Guide To Barrel-Scraping. And Slasher believes she has enough support to win. It’s easy to see why. The feral lovechild of Thatcher and Tebbit ticks all the Tory boxes. Iain Duncan Smith’s chief attack dog at the Department of Work and Pensions has devoted her Westminster career to demonising and impoverishing the poor and disabled, driving many to early graves.    She said the rise of foodbanks was “positive” and that there was “no robust evidence” that linked the soaring take-up of them to welfare cuts. She repeatedly defended the Bedroom Tax. She claimed that benefit ­sanctions “help” people find work and used them to remove payments from jobseekers turning down zero hours contracts. She vowed to take away , people’s disability benefits because “bodies heal”. She claimed the poor prioritise phones over food, even though her department made it necessary for them to have a phone or a computer to claim benefits. She “knowingly” misled ­Parliament over Universal Credit and this week she paved the way for her leadership bid by claiming the Tories are now the natural home of the working class. Sure. Just as American high schools are the natural home of the deranged gunman. The devastating outcome of her work was ­encapsulated recently, a few miles from where she grew up, with the tale of skeletal -year-old Stephen Smith, who, despite having many ­debilitating illnesses, weighing six stone and barely able to walk, was denied benefits.    Harrowing photos of Stephen’s emaciated body went global after the Liverpool Echo ran his story telling how he’d had to seek free advice from outside the system to challenge the DWP ruling. It shamed them into agreeing to pay him the £, he was owed. But it was too late. Because Stephen was dead. Thankfully, a state the Tories must be heading towardsMcVey is in with a shout of leading them. Just rejoice. As her heroine once said.

A spokesperson said: “Jeremy Hosking has contributed to the Brexit party but, for the moment, has nothing further to add.”It came as the PM was facing a backlash over European election leaflets which include a link to a website that names and shames MPs who voted against Theresa May ’s withdrawal deal.The communication does not promise an independent trade deal after Brexit - a sign critics fear the PM is willing to compromise on a customs deal in cross-party talks with Labour .  The leaflet is being sent out by freepost rather than delivered by activists - many of whom are so angry at Mrs May that they are refusing to help.  Nigel Farage insists a win for his Brexit Party which is currently polling % - ahead of Labour on % and the Tories on % - would put “ No Deal Brexit back on the table” as his new party  He said: “Parliament has taken it off the table. Our voters say ‘put it back on the table’ and,we win, we will demand representation, with the Government, at the next stage of negotiations. “We have deadline now of October  and we want to make sure, our voters want to make sure, that, actually, No Deal is being seriously thought-about.” Meanwhile leading Tory leadership hopeful Sajid Javid has delivered a fresh warning to Tory Brexiteers that they could lose Brexit altogether unless they back Theresa May’s deal. Speaking on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Mr Javid said: “I want us to leave with an orderly deal.   “What actually worries me the most is thatwe get to the end of October, there are people in Parliament thatthey think they need to stop no deal, they might even try to revoke [ Article  ]. “That is what worries me the most – that we could lose Brexit altogether.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror means test tv","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Means test for TV licences wont workOver-s depend on the benefit of a free TV licence and means testing will effectively take that leline away from millionsShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY NewsopinionThe plan by the BBC to give TV licences to the elderly on a means-tested basis is not a solution \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFree TV licences have proved a leline for thousands of over-s.

I [would have] had no issue with what he was going to do with it afterwards - itaposs the fact he was so untruthful.    He said aposI need a car for the weekend - Iaposve got a daughter, weaposve moved house, we really need a carapos. I think part of it was that Iaposm a young girl. The fact is he was condescending, when Iaposd already done my research and checked it. But when youaposre dealing with things that are more geared towards men, you start to question yourself.” After deciding to buy a new car for her short commute, Sarah listed her Audi for sale for £, as a bodywork expert reportedly said her bodywork would only need £ to touch up. Mark got in touch with her and offered £, at first, but Sarah showed him a screenshot of an online estimate of more than £,. Telling her to be real, Mark bemoaned the car’s age, miles to the gallon, lack of service history, number of owners and mileage. Despite pointing out the ‘bumps and scrapes’ in the original listing, Mark acted surprised when Sarah mentioned these in their exchange and so comes round to view the vehicle. After assessing the car, Mark then totted up a long list of issues and calculated that it would cost £, to get it up to scratch.  Mark even tried to flog or trade other vehicles he was selling on Facebook during the process - which she turned down. Sarah repeatedly tried to walk away from the sale during the ensuing message exchange but was bombarded with further issues by Mark, until she claims she became worried the car would never sell. Feeling sorry for Mark, worried about her car’s condition and desperate to buy her new pink Nissan Micra convertible, Sarah gave in and settled on just £,. Sarah said: Everybody is going to haggle, but it seems that every tiny thing he picked out was detriment to the price. If you know your facts and how much your caraposs worth, donapost let anybody tell you dferently and [convince] you [to] believe them because youaposre not as confident.  I donapost know why I didnapost tell him to forget it. I was scared I wouldnapost get anyone to buy the car because of what he was saying. The car that I was selling was a really good car. However when Sarah and her mum went on Mark’s Facebook page to seehe was showing off his new purchase, they were devastated to see it listed for sale for £,. Sarah said: Me and my mum thought weaposd have a look to seehe was showing it off. We were dead shocked and thought aposthataposs just an hour after we sold him thatapos. Heaposd put up the photos of the car in my driveway and heaposd put the car was aposimmaculateapos and he was selling it for £,. “My mum was in contact with him saying aposlook, I know youaposve ripped my daughter offapos.” However she claims Mark complained that the car was ‘gubbed’ and that they had ripped him off. While he appears to have listed numerous cars for sale on Facebook over the last year, Mark claims he does not have a side business and just helps friends when they ask him to go to car auctions. However he has since admitted that the vehicle will be sold and saysSarah is not happy then she should not have looked at his Facebook as it’s not for public viewing. Mark said: I bought the car in good faith and do not need to explain myself. “If I bought a car through Facebook for £, spent £, on repairs and sold it on, that’s my business. “If I choose to sell it for £,,, the owner cannot have any comeback. Ms Hutchinson being in debt is not my responsibility. I also have bills to pay and am a single parent.

Six months into her pregnancy Rachel Avon went into hospital suffering from a sharp stabbing feeling in her stomach, fearful her unborn baby was unwell. Doctors decided she needed to have her appendix removed and took her to the operating theatre. While she was under the kne surgeons discovered a tumorous lump and realised she had the rare form of cancerpseudomyxoma peritoneii, which affects one in three million people. The medics decided to remove the tumour and, once she came around, send the -year-old back home. It was only after the birth of her second child Cari that Rachel was told she had had a tumour removed.    The primary school teacher said: It all started with agonising pains in my stomach, I was terried it was linked to my unborn baby so I called the midwe. The midwe advised I go the hospital, which definitely got me thinking the worst. After going to the hospital they believed I had appendicitis. I was really nervous - having surgery at six monthsapos pregnant was a huge thing but they said, despite being pregnant, they had to put my le before the babyaposs. It was an extremely dficult time, but as I was already a mum to Ffion, who was only one at the time, I understood I had to put myself first.    But during this operation, doctors discovered a rare, cancerous tumour and removed it during the surgery. Rachel was then told the operation was for an appendicitis and continued with her pregnancy before giving birth at  weeks. If it wasnapost for Cari my cancer wouldnapost have been picked up as quickly and things could have been a lot worse, the mum, from Newport, Wales continued. It was because of being pregnant that it triggered the issue with my appendix meaning I needed surgery - without the surgery, my tumour wouldnapost have been accidentally found.    Despite the doctorsapos shocking discovery, they made the moral decision not to tell Rachel and her husband Ross, , about the cancer until after she had given birth.  The mum-of-two said: If the tumour was to have spread Iaposd have needed a major operation - something known as aposthe mother of all surgeriesapos- as chemotherapy wouldnapost have worked. MOAS is where they remove all organs you donapost need and internally washing all the others to reduce the number of cancer cells.  It sounds terrible so Iaposm very lucky I didnapost need to have it.     Four days after Cari was born, Rachelaposs consultant asked her to come back to the hospital for what Rachel believed to be a check up following her appendectomy.  She said: When I discovered that doctors hadnapost told me about my cancer I was so shocked - in the short term it didnapost feel like the right decision but five years on, I know it was the right decision they made for us.  Doctors reasoning for not telling me until Cari was born was due to the fact I wouldnapost be able to have an MRI to seethe cancer had spread until after the baby was born. In the five years since the surgery doctors carefully monitored Rachel due to the risks of the cancer ing.    But now she is officially cancer free and counts herself lucky the cancer was found in time. Rachel said: Cari is a really special girl - without her, my cancer could have been a very dferent story. Now, Iaposm healthier and happier than ever I even recently ran the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research UK. Iaposm so lucky to have had the surgery when I did. Iaposm over the moon to be cancer free and now Iaposm determined to raise awareness of pseudomyxoma peritoneii to help other people.

On July  last year, in the Stockport home they had shared for  years, pensioner Lawrence Franks beat his dementia-stricken we Patricia. Then, believing the attack had not proved fatal, the -year-old then smothered her with a pillow.It was, Manchester Crown Court heard, the act of a man who ‘genuinely believed’ he was performing an ‘act of mercy’, reports the Manchester Evening News .   When Mrs Franks had been diagnosed with dementia about a decade earlier her aposutterly devotedapos husband promised she would never go in a care home. But as her condition deteriorated, Mr Franks found it almost impossible to cope. Mrs Franks was practically immobile, incontinent and tragically no longer recognised her beloved husband of  years. And on July , , Mr Franks reached breaking point.  In heart-breaking scenes in the latest episode of the BBC One documentary Ambulance viewers witnessed the moment Mr Franks called  to report his weaposs death. The former bus driver can be heard explaining to call handler Frank that he was no longer able to cope with the demands of caring for Patricia. Iaposve killed my we, he is heard to say. She canapost walk. Incontitent. And I canapost cope. So Iaposve killed her. When asked about weapons, the man said: Only a lump of iron. As Frank assures the man that help is on the way, the caller adds: Thereaposs a little girlaposs party next door, donapost use sirens and spoil it. Sheaposd dead, thataposs all there is.    In November last year Mr Franks pleaded guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility. The court heard at the time of his weaposs death Mr Franks was suffering from an ‘adjustment disorder’ brought on by the stress of caring for her. It meant, the court heard, his ‘judgement to make rational decisions was substantially impaired’. Handing down a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years, Judge David Stockdale told him: “Your devotion to her was total and unconditional. “She was particularly anxious not to be placed in a care home and said so repeatedly, particularly as her health deteriorated.    “But the burden of looking after her became impossible for you. “You showed your we nothing but love and affection and for the last  years tended to her every need. Your devotion was quite exceptional. “There is no sentence I can pass that will turn back the clock or recompense for the loss of Patricia Franks’ le. “In my judgement this is an exceptional case.” "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 11 drayton manor theme","story":"NewsGirl, , in Drayton Manor theme park accident dies after falling from Splash Canyon rideThe girl, from the Leicester area, was airlted to hospital after falling off the ride at the Staffordshire theme park but sadly passed away shortly afterwardsShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews ReporterAnthony BondDanya Bazaraa:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video george-bryan-speaks-press-conference-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn -year-old girl has died after falling from a ride at Drayton Manor theme park while on a school trip.

Superintendent Carl Ratclfe, of Staffordshire Police, said: “Specially-trained officers are supporting the girl’s family at this dficult time. “Our thoughts are very much with her family and friends following this tragic incident.” He added the Health and Safety Executivehad been informed of the incident.

Speaking at a media briefing at Drayton Manor this evening, he said: “Further to the police statement which has been issued to yourself and your colleagues a few moments ago, it is with great sadness that we have to report that a young girl has passed away at Birmingham Children’s Hospital following an incident at one of our rides this afternoon. “Our staff were alerted that an -year-old girl had entered the water. “Trained park staff were immediately on the scene attending to the patient and West Midlands Air Ambulance arrived and airlted her to hospital. “We are truly shocked and devastated, and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this tremendously dficult time.” Drayton Manor Theme Park will be closed tomorrow as a mark of respect to the family of the young schoolgirl.  The Staffordshire County Council leader has also spoken of his sadness and shock at the tragic death of an -year-old today. Councillor Philip Atkins said: “It is absolutely sad and shocking news to hear how a day of adventure has ended in such tragedy for this young girl, and our thoughts are very much with her family and friends this evening. “Drayton Manor Theme Park was opened as a family business back in  and I know the Bryan family, who are still involved with the park today, will be absolutely devastated by this accident and will undoubtedly do all they can to help find out how this tragic accident occurred.”  The -year-oldaposs horried classmates raised the alarm after watching the girl fall from a six-person boat at the Staffordshire theme park. Emergency services rushed to the scene at .pm after reports of a child in the water close near the fast-paced rapids ride. The girl, from the Leicester area, was on a school trip to the Staffordshire theme park. She was treated at the scene before being airlted to hospital. The girl’s school, Jameah Academy, said in a statement: “Parents s will be aware that pupils and staff of Jameah Academy, based in Leicester, went on a school trip to Drayton Manor Park on Tuesday th May . “Whilst at the theme park, an incident took place and a girl from year  had been airlted to hospital. Sadly, she later passed away. “We are liaising with the relevant authorities at this time. Please be assured that the safety and wellbeing of all of our pupils is a priority. “We would also request that the family as well as the school community be given the time to grieve. The statement said that the school is providing support to pupils and staff and are unable to provide any further information at this time.  The father of another pupil on the trip said his daughter is in the year above the girl has who died and is “absolutely distraught”. He said: “The entire school went to Drayton Manor. All the girls had been looking forward to it. “My daughter is in the year above the girl who died and is absolutely distraught. “She was on another ride at the time and only realised something was wrong when she saw other girls in tears. “Nobody knows how it happened.” He added that it is a tragedy and that people want answers. Last night there was a notice posted outside the school where students are aged between three and  stating “Drayton Manor trip pupils will arrive by .pm.” On the school website, the head Erfana Bora writes: “We have come such a long way since we started with a handful of pupils who followed the hz programme, all being nurtured and cared for by a team of committed and caring teachers, leaders and governors.“Our ethos then, and now, is that each pupil in our care is an amaanah , and deserves the best opportunities for realising her potential as a well-rounded British Muslim who is able to go on to achieve great things both within and beyond the classroom.” The Leicester Muslims Association paid tribute saying: “An  year old girl has passed away, from leicester she studied at jameah girls academy and went on school trip to Drayton manor.“We humbly request all to make dua for her and may Allah grant her family.” Hundreds of members of her community gathered for evening prayers at the mosque opposite the girlaposs school this evening.  A spokesman for Jame Masjid Mosque opposite the girl’s school said: “Her family sent her off to school in the morning expecting to hear about her amazing day at Drayton Manor but the unthinkable happened.” The young girl’s death has shaken the community and they are all devastated. “Obviously our thoughts are with the family after this heart breaking news,” the spokesman said. “When anyone dies it’s a tragedy but when it’s a child as young as she was it’s just awful.” He said all that can be done now is to pray for her family and hold them in their thoughts. The spokesman added: “It will be a painful wait to hear about exactly what happened following a police investigation because at the moment all we know is she fell, not how or why.”  Visitors told how they heard crying and screaming coming from the main entrance of the ride. Graham Johnstone, , said earlier: The first I knew something was wrong when I saw staff running over to the ride and turn people away. Minutes later an air ambulance appeared overhead. All you could hear was crying coming from the steps leading to the ride entrance. It was awful. The emergency services were on the scene so quickly. I saw the air ambulance land but it didnapost take off again. I just hope the kid was ok.  Eyewitness Matt Mason, , said: I was on Splash Canyon just before the person who fell in. Didnapost see it happen but was collecting my family photo when a lady came up to the collection booth to say that a girl had fallen in. She was pretty calm so we assumed it was nothing major. Shortly afterwards, police, fire and ambulances arrived and the ride and whole area was closed. No one seemed panicked over an hour later when we left. Mum Fiona Fletcher, , from Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, was at the park with her two young daughters. She said she heard a car come charging through clearing the path and then paramedics flew past.  My kids and I had just got off the carousel ride and all we could hear were sirens. It really scared my daughters, she told. The entrance to the Splash Canyon was probably a few hundred yards from where I was standing and there was clearly a huge commotion. I saw six fire engines, at least five police cars, four ambulances and two paramedic cars and an air ambulance. They put metal barriers up around the whole area so no one could get in. She said it was a quiet day and that there were only a few hundred people in the park, and that as staff began ushering people away, many were confused. When she saw an ambulance charge out of the barriers with sirens blaring she realised she had to leave.  Superintendent Carl Ratclfe, of Staffordshire Police, previously said: We were called at .pm this afternoon to reports that a child had fallen from a water ride at Drayton Manor Park. The girl, believed to be -years-old from the Leicester area, has been airlted to Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital. Her parents have been informed and are being supported by officers.

Drayton Manor said the ride was closed after the incident and staff assisted emergency services.

And I couldn’t afford any of them yesterday, when the possessions of Labour’s most successful PM went under the hammer. His trademark raincoat, the gt of crooked textile tycoon Lord Kagan, was offered at a minimum £ but made £ in the ­political sale of the century – a Downing Street version of Bargain Hunt. I wasn’t the only oldie in the Hansons Auctioneers at Bishton Hall, near Stafford, who remembered wily Wilson.    But I was probably the only one who’d been in No at Harold’s drinks parties in the s. And certainly the only one who’s written a modest biography of Huddersfield’s most famous son, so I felt a proprietary interest. Alas, these prices were out of my league. The No silver ­cigarette box, listed at £-£, fetched £,. Money was piling in from more than  countries. A cloisonne vodka set estimated at up to £ went for treble that. Christmas cards from the Queen and Prince Philip, Charles and Diana, and Margaret Thatcher fetched amazing prices.    This was a man who never threw anything away: a centenary bottle of his favourite HP Sauce, a bust of Nye Bevan, boxes of his favourite cigars, and even his  ­election address. Harold died in , aged , and widow Lady Wilson died in June last year, aged . So valuer Jim Spencer was called to the family flat in London and the Scillies holiday cottage. “Seven vanloads were waiting, a huge part of our collective history – the wheels and cogs and nuts and bolts of the Wilson story.”  Some nuts. Some bolts. Gold necklaces, diamond rings, even Harold’s OBE. A silver tray inscribed with autographs of our  World Cup winners: asking price £-£, made £,. “It’s a thrill to handle this sale,” celebrity auctioneer Charles Hanson – of Flog It! – told me.  Harold’s sons Robin, a maths professor, and Giles, a one-time train driver, were watching. “Going better than expected,” said Robin. The estimate for the auction, all proceeds going to the family estate, was £, but the outcome was more than double. The piece de resistance was that iconic Gannex mac. Kagan invented the waterproof fabric and Harold was a walking advert.  Harold’s old shoes came cheaper in a job lot, only worth mentioning to recall the Tory taunt: thathe went barefoot to school as a boy, it was because he was too big for his boots. Parliamentary rhetoric being at a low ebb, you can’t buy that kind of jibe these days. Not even in the saleroom.

That man, who wanted to remain anonymous, has lived in Balsall Heath since  and spoke after a -year-old was gunned down. The victim was shot in the face in a targeted attack outside Strensham Court at .pm on Tuesday, April , after a fracas. Less than  hours later and exactly one mile away, a bullet was fired at a car on Roshven Road, near Balsall Heath Park.  Officers on May  sent out an immediate appeal to track down a blue Hyundai Tuscon or black Mazda which was spotted in the vicinity. Roshven Road - a terrace-lined street - would have been full of pedestrians at the time of the gun going off. Then, on May , George Street Play Park was sealed off as officers scrambled to the scene at .pm amid reports of a shot was fired. West Midlands Police taped off the area. Birmingham Live, meanwhile, quizzed top chiefs at the force, askingrecent shootings have been related or linked to revenge attacks.  Detective Inspector Rich Marsh said officers have launched a specic op to gather intelligence amid firearms on the streets in Balsall Heath. We’re investigating a series of firearms incidents in the Balsall Heath area and have launched a dedicated operation to gather intelligence and arrest those believed to be involved, he said. An -year-old man has been charged with attempted murder and firearms possession after a shot was fired in George Road on May . He appeared in court on May  and has been remanded into prison ahead of his next crown court appearance on  June.

We’ve increased our patrols in the area since the shootings and unmarked armed response vehicles are never more than a few minutes away.  Such reckless use of firearms in public is totally unacceptable. We suspect these are targeted attacks but innocent members of the public could easily have got caught up in the incidents and seriously injured or killed. Anyone involved or linked to firearms can expect to spend many years behind bars.

I speak not out of bitterness, my le moved on many years ago, but out of concern. “Archie deserves to be brought up in a happy home, not in this vengeful situation that has been created. “Tom was an awful father. What makes him think he’d be a great ­grandfather to Archie ” Roslyn, who has survived cancer, met Thomas in the summer of  at a house party in Chicago. He was  and working at WTTW studios, while she was a clerk at the Illinois Railroad Company.    Roslyn told how she was ­immediately struck by the “tall, ­handsome man” with “a great sense of humour and charming smile”. She was soon pregnant with their first child, Samantha, and decided to get married. The pair found a large one-bedroom apartment in Chicago as Samantha arrived in November  and lived a happy, normal le, but soon the cracks began to appear. Roslyn, who lives in ­Albuquerque, New Mexico, said: “As I was no longer working, Tom’s paycheck was the only money coming in. “But to him, his money was his and his alone. Whenever I asked for help to feed to kids or buy diapers, he’d scream, ‘Get a f*****g job’ and then laugh. “I can still see the look in his face and how he’d clench his teeth in anger. Although he was never violent, Tom would often lose his temper. “He would scream, ‘F*** you’. ‘F*** off.’ ‘Leave me the f*** alone’ or, ‘Get the f*** out of here.’ Everything was f***. He called me a f****** c*** a lot. “He knew I was helpless as I had nothing, so what could I do ” Despite their dficulties, Roslyn hoped when she became pregnant with their second child, Tom Jnr in December , things would change. But the situation grew worse. She added: “He got so bad he wanted the kids and me gone, so Tom drove us down to his ­mother’s house in Pennsylvania and ­abandoned us. I begged him to send us some money.    “Tom was living a single le in Chicago while we were barely surviving. It was left to his parents to feed and clothe us all. “Tom’s mother Doris and dad Gordon could not have been more dferent, but it was making them broke. “They told Tom to come and get us so, ­reluctantly, he did. But back in Chicago things were no dferent. He didn’t give me anything. “He had cars but never once took the kids or me out. It could be snowing and the children would need food, but he refused to take me. “I’d either have to take the bus or take out the pram or a cart to get what I needed. It got so bad that one day I had nothing to feed the kids with, I went down the local corner store and got some food. “I put some items on top of Jnr’s blanket, but I put many ­underneath it. I am so ashamed, but I had to steal, it was the only way I could feed them.” While Roslyn was left at home to look after their children, she claims Thomas would disappear for days before coming home at am to have a shower, change and go to work. She added: “I was trying to bring up the kids and Tom lived his le as a single man. He’d be gone all night long and come back smelling of women. “All the signs would be there. He’d have makeup on him and smelling of perfume. “To this day, I’ve not spoken to a close relative of mine in  years after I learnt she had slept with Tom while we were married. Even one Christmas Day he strolled in at am from being out. “He walked in to see the kids had opened their presents. “My mum was there. He took one look at her and said, ‘What the f*** is she doing here ’ It was awful. That’s how awful he could be.” She said: “One day, the we of one of Tom’s bosses took me to the studio to see where he worked.    “She pointed at a young woman and said, ‘That’s Barbara, Tom’s ­girlfriend.’ I was floored.” Roslyn claimed Thomas even mentioned his alleged lover in bed. She added: “Tom was half-asleep. He cuddled up to me and pinched my butt. He said, ‘What a nice ass you have, Barbara.’ I went crazy. I kicked him so hard he fell out of the bed. “I knew I had to get away, but I had no money and nowhere to go.” Eventually a friend of Roslyn’s offered her a way out. She and the children could leave while Thomas was out and stay at her home. Roslyn started packing. She added: “The time finally came and when he left my ­girlfriends came round, we loaded up the cars. I stripped the apartment bare and left it with a letter telling him we were never coming back. “He called me pleading for me to come back, but I refused. He said he’d take me for everything in the orce. “He sent me papers saying he’d been a ‘true, kind and affectionate husband’ but I never signed it. “There was no way I was going back. He wasn’t a father to Vonnie [Samantha] or Tom.  “The only time he wanted to know was when they were walking and talking and taking care of themselves.” Roslyn also told how Thomas took cocaine. She said: “Drugs and the TV studios went hand in hand and Tom was no dferent. “Cocaine was re in the circles he worked in. It was only a matter of time before he was doing coke too.” During Meghan’s pregnancy, Thomas heaped embarrassment on his daughter by admitting he took cocaine. In October, he said: “In the industry, I worked in back in the s and s, there was cocaine around a lot. And I’m sure that I had an ­occasional snf of cocaine.” To add to Meghan’s distress, Thomas also said he went to the Philippines and frequented the now-defunct Playboy Club in Manila’s red light district. He denied paying for sex. Roslyn claims her ex-husband at one point sent money to one woman in the city to help her out. She added: “He told me before he was supporting a family over there financially.” Roslyn told how she recently watched in disbelief as Thomas carried out his repeated betrayals of Meghan in “endless media rampages” including revealing his daughter’s highly private letter to him.  Even more painful has been seeing “toxic” Samantha viciously attack the royal couple in “an orchestrated and unfounded campaign of hate”. Thomas married Doria four years after his orce from Roslyn. But Roslyn can see why she fell for him. She said: “Tom would have swept Doria off her feet. He would have turned on the charm as he did me, even more so because of how young she was. But I’m sure she quickly saw similar things to what I had.” Meghan has not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Harry last May after they fell out. Roslyn claimed ­Hollywood may have changed both of them as people and led to dficulties but added: “I suspect the problems between them are more deep-rooted and centre on her upbringing. “He has always lived a dysal le. My kids suffered as a result and I’m sure Meghan has too.” In response to Roslyn’s allegations, Thomas said: “These accusations about my relationship more than  years ago with my first we are not valid. None of them. “If you have ­questions ask my children. “Take note that both Samantha and Tom Jr left their mother and came to live with me because of her numerous bad habits and abuse. “I have up until this moment never said a bad word about Roslyn but I must defend myself.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles name archie nod","story":"NewsMeghan Markles name Archie is nod to dad and could be her reaching out, claims palMeghan Markle and Prince Harry named their first son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - and one friend believes they know whyShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMeghan Markle with her father Thomas Markle\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markleaposs name choice for her first son with Prince Harry could be a subtle nod to her dad Thomas Markle.

But following the death of her son Dean in October , Sheila fell into a deep sadness and found comfort in food to hide away from the grief she was feeling. She was dealt a second crushing blow when her partner of seven years, Conrad, , died in August  from a stomach aneurysm - days after proposing while on a cruise.    Her weight spiralled out of control and at her heaviest tipped the scales at st after gorging on chocolates, junk food and sugary snacks. Sheila, who is ft in tall, decided to overhaul her lestyle to help give daughter Lucy, who suffers from Dravet Syndrome, which is a type of epilepsy with seizures, the best le possible. She discovered : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan - which educates people on portion size as well as carbohydrate control - in June last year and lost lb in her first week.    Sheila, from St Helens, Merseyside, reached her target weight of just over st in three months later after shedding more than st, which she has maintained since. She said: When you are in a deep depression you donapost really think about what you are feeding yourself. You go into a state of despondency, you know these foods are bad for you but you donapost care. Sugary snacks give you a temporary high. I started thinking aposyou have one le, and you have to live itapos. Losing weight really helped me focus and move forward.  Just because you have lost someone and having the stress of having a child with a disability you have to look forward with these things. Since losing both Dean and Conrad my le has been a roller coaster of emotions and my weight has gone up and down but overtime I realised that I needed to keep myself fit and healthy for Lucy. Sheila struggled trying to look after two young children and holding down her job and says the only control she had in her le was food. This was aggravated when she woke up one night in October  to hear the noise of Dean, who suffered from syndromic autosomal dominant disorder GEFS+ Syndrome, having a seizure.  I called an ambulance and he was taken to intensive care in Alder Hey Hospital, she added. Five days later they turned off his ventilator. Dean was taken from me on October , . To lose your child really is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Dean was the best son, my buddy, my little rock. I miss him every minute of every day. I treasure the  years I had with him.  I cannot remember the next year of my le. I was so sad. My weight escalated. I was eating and drinking way too much but didnapost care. Lucy was sad too and she needed me. She was fitted with a gastric band in January  to stabilise her ballooning weight. Sheila was then dealt her second family tragedy when her new fiance died suddenly. We were on holiday and had got engaged two days before, she added. aposI can honestly say I have never been as happy as I am right nowapos - those were the last words he said to me.Related video: When I woke up in the morning he was dead in bed. Sheila saw an unflattering photo of her in a pink bikini while on holiday with friends last year and decided enough was enough.

Researchers found they were more likely to order a lesaving cancer test at the start of the day compared with appointments closer to home time. Experts believe “decision fatigue” means they are less likely to put a patient forward for the routine screening. Early diagnosis is seen as key to improving Britain’s cancer survival rates which lag behind most of Europe. Scientists analysed data on , US patients who were eligible for a breast cancer of bowel cancer screening test. The study found % of eligible patients seen at am were ordered the breast screening test compared to % seen at around pm. For bowel cancer % got the test during appointments at the start of the day compared to % with appointments near the end. Lead author Esther Hsiang of Pennsylvania University, said: “Our findings suggest that future interventions targeting improvements in cancer screening might focus on time of day as an important factor in influencing behaviours.  “We believe that the downward trend of ordering may be the result of ‘decision fatigue,’ where people may be less inclined to consider a new decision after they’ve been making them all day. “It may also stem from overloaded clinicians getting behind as the day progresses.” It comes as the NHS staffing crisis is seeing overworked GPs see more patients per day than ever before. Lunchtime seemed to give GPs a boost in enthusiasm as there was a brief spike in screening test orders around noon. At am % of patients got them which rose to % at midday. Other than this rates fell during the course of the day. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “UK GPs are under more pressure than ever before as patient numbers rise and diseases are becoming more complex - at the same time as we have a severe shortage of family doctors. “But GPs will always aim do the very best we can for every single patient we see, and patients in the UK should be assured that the care they receive should not be affected by the time of day of their appointment. “GPs are acutely aware of how important it is to identy symptoms of cancer in a timely way and we are doing a good job, with % of patients found to have some form of cancer referred after only one or two consultations. “But we also need more investment in diagnostic tools to help us detect early cancers that have no symptoms at all.”    Scientists suggest doctors should be “nudged” by computer systems which prompt them to respond “yes” or “no” whether a screening test should be ordered. Previous studies on rates of flu vaccinations offered showed this can reduce decision fatigue. Co-author Mitesh Patel, director of the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit, said: “Our new study adds to the growing evidence that time of day and decision fatigue impacts patient care. “In past work, we’ve found that nudges in the electronic health record can be used to address these types of gaps in care, which we suspect will be the case here. “Future research could evaluate how nudges may be implemented in order to improve cancer screening.” Prof Stokes-Lampard added: “Every day over one million patients are seen in general practice and the number of patients seen by GPs is escalating. “There is a limit beyond which we can no longer guarantee safe care, and more must be done to support GP wellbeing so that hard-working and dedicated family doctors can continue doing the job that they are highly trained and skilled to do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pretty little thing ridiculed selling","story":"NewsPretty Little Thing ridiculed for selling stare stealing SEE-THROUGH clothesThe extremely revealing range of clothing, on sale for up to £, has been likened to cling film by disgruntled customersShareByDavid Coleman:,  MAY NewsThe see through outfit has caused quite a stir online \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailClothing site Pretty Little Thing has been slammed for selling SEE-THROUGH outfits.

Her addiction to the drug almost ruined her le and her relationship with her four children.She told LincolnshireLive : “The problem in Lincoln seems to be getting worse, and something needs to be done to fix it.“The council is doing all it can to make the city look nice, but then you see people sleeping in the streets with drug packets around them.    “If I was going to care for one of those people, I would like to understand their situation and why they have turned down the path that I went down. “There is a much better le for these people than sleeping in a doorway.” The -year-old previously developed a dependency to cans of high strength lager before moving on to smoking high-strength cannabis. Drugs, she says, were an escape from the trauma she had suffered at a young age. A former friend introduced her to synthetic cannabinoids - sometimes known as legal highs - which she used as a cheaper drug. At one stage she travelled to Scunthorpe to stock up on £ bags of spice before the shop closed down. To make matters worse, one of her daughters was going in and out of the Queenaposs Medical Centre in Nottingham with a long-term bowel condition called ulcerative colitis. “It was dficult for me to face going to the hospital – I felt ashamed that spice had taken over my le like this”, she said. Charlotte claimed that she was then befriended by the supplier who gave her the aposrewardapos of getting spice for free - as long as she kept hold of his stash of drugs after his property was raided by police. “I felt like I was winning at this point”, said Charlotte.    On September , she and her husband were arrested after the authorities discovered more than  ounces of Mamba underneath their garden decking. The police find is understood to be the biggest seizure of Mamba in Lincolnshire since it was made a class B controlled drug in December . September  was signicant for another reason – it was the day Charlotte eventually quit smoking Spice for good. She told Lincolnshire Live: “Those three days and nights that I spent in a cell gave me a time to reflect upon what I was doing to myself. “Spice had completely taken over my le and it prevented me from having the relationship with my kids that I really wanted. I wanted to live for something better than this. “I felt ashamed that it had gotten to this stage. What had started as just an escape became something more. “I had to change for my kids.” Charlotte has since been clean for more than eight months and is now training to become a peer support worker. The mother-of-four said that she was able to get herself out of her situation but said frequent visits to carers and counsellors ‘didn’t help’. She added: “Counselling didn’t work for me. I kept getting referred to dferent people just as I was developing a bond with one of them. People in that situation need to get someone to help them every step of the way. “There are not enough people employed to deal with the problem, which means that there is no consistency in care.

Tanya Ricardo, , from Houston, Texas, USA, spent over a decade waiting for her ‘womanly’ body to aposdevelopapos. Throughout her le she was taunted over her body shape and told to ‘eat a cheeseburger’ or ‘cake’, as well as others assuming she had an eating disorder. The years of abuse led her to long to change her appearance and last month she finally went under the kne.Using her royal idol Meghan Markle as a guide, she longed to emulate her curves and further their resemblance.   She had liposuction to transfer fat to her buttocks, fat grafts to her cheeks, lipo under the cheeks and chin, breast augmentation from a c-cup to a d-cup, lip fillers and other injectable treatments. Now in recovery after six hours of surgery, she’s delighted with her transformation so far and can’t wait to flaunt her new curvy physique at the beach. Tanya, a land technician, said: “I have always been a very skinny girl, so I never really felt like I was a woman and surgery has been on my mind. “People have teased me for my whole le, even to this day, they say things like ‘eat a cheeseburger’ or they accuse me of having an eating disorder. “This wasn’t and has never been the case, I eat and I love food. “I hoped from the surgeries I would appear a lot more like how I wanted to look, which is a grown woman.  “I didn’t know when my adult, woman’s body was going to decide to show up. “Everyone just told me to wait and it would catch up with me, but I turned  and it still hadn’t ‘caught up’. “It’s something I have been waiting for years, but being a single-mom, my priority was my son so I wasn’t thinking about myself. “Now I’m ecstatic, I can’t wait to be able to hit the gym with extra weight in the right places and then I’ll be good to marry another Prince. She continued: “I do think I look more like Meghan Markle, I see it in the shape of my face. “We have always resembled each other, we both have dark hair, big brown eyes and a structured fine nose. But now that I had had a couple of surgeries on my face it accentuates her look on me even more. “Meghan not only has a great sense of style, she is very classy, sexy and sophisticated all in one.  “When people say they see the resemblance, which for me makes me feel like it was mission accomplished.” Growing-up Tanya always thought uncomfortable with her body, not buying fitted jeans for years after the years of insults and unfair comments. Then after giving birth to son Gavin, now five, she was left with baby fat on her stomach and her breast size dropped from a full to a small c-cup after breastfeeding. Tanya said: “I was extremely self-conscious with what I wore, I didn’t like showing my legs – I just wasn’t happy with what I saw in the mirror. “My bottom half, so my butt and thighs didn’t really exist, I looked very young and didn’t have the curves I wanted. “People would tell me I was beautul and to be thankful for being slender, but all of the negative comments overrode all the good things I heard about myself.”    But since undergoing the surgeries on April , Tanya has felt more confident and hopes to dispel her self-doubt by continuing to empower herself. Tanya said: “I feel like a dferent person and happy, hopefully the negative comments will stop and won’t affect me. “They transferred some of the extra baby fat in my stomach from pregnancy into my butt. “I never had a butt before, I felt like I never had curves when I was young so it’s great. “I’ve not fully healed so haven’t seen myself full but my face and top half is great, I can’t wait to show it off at the beach. “My family were concerned initially because they always thought I was beautul, but after seeing what a wonderful job Dr. Rose did they are happy too.” Tanya had work with Utopia Plastic Surgery  Med Spa, who have seen a spike in those seeking to look like the new-royal Meghan.  Dr. Franklin Rose said: “Many women want Meghan Markle nose and cheeks, she has quite an attractive face and pretty body. “Meghan Markle is so much in the mainstream with this baby, she’s probably number one even above Kim Kardashian-West. “Tanya started really pretty, it’s a lot easier to take a patient from A to C, than A to Q, all she needed was refining. “With this patient, she is much more confident after we changed her body image for the better.” Now overwhelmed with her appearance so far and more surprises to come, as it will take six months for her to fully heal – Tanya can’t wait to embark on a career change. She added: “My biggest dream is to become a model and actress, which is another way that we are alike. “I’m going to pursue those dreams now, I’ve modelled before but was never confident in how I looked so hopefully this will help. “Confidence is an extreme factor in the modelling world and I know it will help me push myself to my limits.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman claims shes found best","story":"NewsBest house on Rightmove is filled with incredible things - and people are loving itEach room in the five-bedroom semi-detatched house in Birmingham, which is on the market for £,, has its own unique styleShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe inside is very unusual \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFlicking through properties on Rightmove can become a bit addictive, and many people end up spending hours looking at house after house.

Built in AD in ancient Constantinople - today Istanbul in Turkey - the Hagia Sophia is the crowning masterpiece of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian the Great. Through his work rebuilding Rome and reclaiming lands lost to the empire, Justinian earned the nickname the last Roman from some historians. Now,  years after his death, researchers have uncovered the exact spot in the Hagia Sophia where he stood during ceremonies. Today the emperor’s place is marked by a humble circle of stone, unnoticed amid the grandeur of the wider building until now.    Ken Dark, who has spent years studying the former cathedral with fellow archaeologist Jan Kostenec, explained that the stone was called a porphyry. “The porphyry disc was found in, and found to be part of, the original floor of the Justinianic church and is aligned with a doorway from that time,” he said. “Such discs are known from both archaeological and written evidence to have marked where emperors stood during ceremonies. “Given that it was part of Justinian’s Hagia Sophia, it must have been where that emperor was intended to stand – and presumably stood – during a religious ceremony.”  He continued: “The exact ceremony involved is uncertain, but this would have been somewhere he stood with clergy and members of the court rather than in full view of the wider congregation. “It is a smaller enclosed space than the vast area beneath the dome, suitable for more private devotions and liturgy.” Its one of a number of discoveries set to “revolutionise” our understanding of the ancient building, according to Dr Dark. The University of Reading professor said they had unearthed the original baptistery where the imperial family would have baptised their children.    On top of that, another part of the building thought to have been a later Ottoman addition has been shown to be far older. Archaeologists now believe that the northwest vestibule was built when Justinian still reigned over the Eastern Roman empire, which today is known as the Byzantine empire. “The wall of the vestibule is bonded into – and therefore demonstrably built at the same time as – the adjacent, well-dated, original wall of Justinian’s church of Hagia Sophia,” he said. Dr Dark concluded: “This new material revolutionises understanding of the Byzantine-period Hagia Sophia complex. “It requires major revision to common understanding of the plan of the sixth-century church itself.”  The Hagia Sophia served as a Christian cathedral from its completion in AD until , when it was converted into a mosque by its Ottoman conquerors. The building continued as a mosque until , before reopening in  as a museum, which it has remained since. However, Turkish president Recep Erdoğan has publicly raised the idea of converting it back into a mosque. All the team’s discoveries at the site are revealed in the new book, Hagia Sophia in Context: An Archaeological Reexamination of the Cathedral of Byzantine Constantinople.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby youngsters lead oban to victory","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowYoung Mid Argyll rugby players Drew Buckley, Anya Gritten and Amber Russell took part in the Glasgow Warriors championship with their Oban U Girls team mates on Wednesday February .The girls won all four of their games, scoring a remarkable  tries and conceding only two.They also played in the first round of the Scottish Cup in Oban against East Kilbride on Sunday February , progressing to the next round after an  impressive - points victory.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul.

Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach. These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupils-and-staff-team-up-for-edinburgh-marathon","story":"A team of  will represent Knox Academy at the Edinburgh Marathon Festival in the half marathon.Eleven pupils and eight members of staff will all pull on special t-shirts highlighting that they are running for East Lothian Special Needs Playscheme .Alex Redford, a modern studies teacher at the school, said they were looking forward to taking to the start line on May .He said: ldquoS have really tried to embody the school values of Ambition, Respect and Community this year.ldquoThey have worked so very hard on ious fundraisers throughout the year and it has been great to see them really engage with the school values.Pupils Matthew Black, Dylan Brotherston, Isabelle Bowen, Elliot Cochrane, Harry Cunningham, Hana Elder, Adam Fairgrieve, Mateusz Juchniewicz, Max Leveque, Daniel Mackinnon and Lauren Taylor will be joined on the start line by Lana Borwick , Robert Flood , Susanne Fox , Steven Illingworth , Adam Miller , Thomas Salkeld , Suzie Stewartand Mr Redford.Pupil Dylan said: ldquoThere is a little bit of friendly rivalry between the pupils.ldquoObviously, we are all quite competitive with each other and we are quite close friends.

This is about who we are, how we carry ourselves.The first words on that inaugural Wednesday morning were not so poetic.They were plain, polite and to the point. But they were typical of the person who said them, and that straightforward manner has served him well ever since.He is now Sir Paul, Holyroodrsquos clerk and chief executive.He has had a ringside seat through every twist, turn and scandal of devolution, acting as a neutral ldquoadviser and small-p political manager to five First Ministers and five Presiding Officers, the resident authority on parliamentrsquos rules and legislation.He also oversees the day to day running of the building itself. ldquoEverything from strategic planning to making sure the pie and chips is good in the canteen, as he puts it.His history with the project predates even the New Labour government that ushered it in.After graduating from Stirling University in , he entered the civil service fast stream, working in both Whitehall and the Scotland Office in Edinburgh.In the spring of  he was tasked with working up a draft white paper on devolution in readiness for Tony Blair becoming Prime Minister.On the weekend after the election, he met Mr Dewar to discuss it. He then led on the legislation for the Scottish and Welsh referendums, then on the Scotland Act, and then became director of implementation for the embryonic Scottish Parliament.ldquoDonald Dewar said, lsquoSomebodyrsquos got to go and set this thing up - and thatrsquos you.rsquoldquoI remember that day with a sense of excitement, a sense of relief, because we had been working so intensely, he recalls.ldquoI wanted the members to feel like theyrsquod arrived at something like a parliament.ldquoThe truth is, for all our planning, we didnrsquot actually know it was going to work until it did.As a career civil servant, hersquod seen numerous policies come and go. Did he think devolution was another idea that might fizzle out once ministers and priorities had moved on ldquoIt did feel dferent for a number of reasons. There had been a referendum. I know wersquove got a little bit more used to referendums, but it was a highly unusual thing.ldquoYoursquod had a referendum with a resounding result, close to %. That gave it a sense of permanence. This was something patently dferent from any policy I had worked on before.After the ldquodficult, rocky patch of the early s, when Donald Dewar died, Henry McLeish resigned as FM in disgrace, and Holyrood was delayed and over-budget, he says the parliament turned a corner in its second session, the so-called Rainbow Parliament.Not only did it move into a new home at the foot of the Royal Mile, it caught peoplersquos imagination, with new Greens, Socialists and even a Senior Citizens Unity Party MSP.ldquoThen it really did look very dferent from the UK parliament. Yet wersquod also done a lot of the basics twice successfully. Wersquod inducted new members, wersquod elected a new government. Wersquod done all these things and all the systems seemed to work.In terms of changes since, he says a key one has been the growth in MSPsrsquo confidence, reinforcing the sense of permanence around the institution. Another is technology.The parliament arrived when the internet meant dial-up and mobile phones were merely phones. Now, the parliament live-streams every meeting, has its own YouTube channel, and engages with the country through social media.He predicts the next  years will bring more profound technological change, with MSPs able to participate in committees and possibly debates remotely, with far more public interaction.Right now, hersquos also helping put together an old-school book of essays about the anniversary. What struck him most was the sheer iety of contributions.ldquoFrom taxation to engagement to more philosophical reflections. Because this place means so many things to dferent people. Itrsquos been fascinating how many dferent people have dferent takes on the parliament.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone would claim it has been perfect, but it has been a game-changer.ldquoPeople now expect involvement in what happens in their country on the devolved areas, on health and education. Thatrsquos very dferent from the Scotland I remember when I came back in lsquo. Thatrsquos been a real change and I think the parliament has tried to embrace that.As for Scotlandrsquos constitutional future, hersquos diplomatic, but prepared.In , he and his team undertook what he calls ldquosome serious preps on whether Holyrood had the capacity toas the legislature of an independent nation.ldquoThe short answer was yes, he says. ldquoWe worked out how much time we would have after a Yes vote to make those changes. We estimated wersquod have a full parliament [four years] to do that, and that would allow us to adapt the building, make other changes.ldquoWe were very confident that had there been a Yes vote in  that we would have been able to meet all the requirements of the politicians in that time.ldquoWe were satisfied that wersquod be able to sit down with the new administration after that and say, lsquoRight, in detail, what do you want and what are you going to do rsquoldquoAnd we felt wersquod be able to support that process. If that meant, ultimately, more buildings or more seats, wersquod have time to accommodate that.Does he think hersquoll have to activate that plan  ldquoWho knows, he smiles wryly.Hersquos more forthcoming about what  might occupy the  parliamentary session. The parties could do a lot worse than a root-and-branch reform of local government.The last one was under John Majorrsquos Conservative government a quarter of a century ago.ldquoMy memory of that... is a vast amount of effort and no thanks at the end of it.ldquoBut maybeBrexit eventually settles down so it doesnrsquot become the all-consuming issue, itrsquos the sort of thing that you might persuade people to look at cross-party.ldquoAndnot a Royal Commission, something quite substantial - analysis of everything from the funding to the powers, to the relationships to the electoral model.ldquoI think it would be welcome. I think therersquos an appetite. Itrsquos just finding the time and recognising that it probably would take a whole session of parliament from the start of that to the implementation of it.ldquoBut that requires a lot of political commitment across parties, and therersquos always a more pressing priority, and not just Brexit.tomorrow: First minister Nicola Sturgeon on two decades of the Scottish Parliament"},{"url":null,"title":"ruth-wishart-scotland-celebrated-its-new-parliament-like-a-world-cup-win-but-this-was-more-durable-more-remarkable","story":"The more chronologically gted foot soldiers for devolution have less than fond memories of that first referendum in rsquo. Voters whispered Yes to what seems now a pretty shilpit Scottish Assembly. By, as it happens, almost the same winning margin as the Leave vote managed in .But instead of this being hailed as the sacred will of the people, it was quickly sabotaged by an amendment passed by the London based Scottish MP George Cunningham. It said  per cent of the entire electorate had to have said yes. At a stroke, non voters were deemed No voters.Eighteen long years passed before the next poll in . And this time a dferent sort of spanner was inserted in the works. Tony Blair, never exactly Mr Devolution, decreed there would be two questions asked this time. Did the Scots want a parliament. And did they want it to have tax ying powers.Donald Dewar, then Secretary of State for Scotland, was more concerned about the possible impact of the tax question than he ever publicly admitted. In the event, on a  per cent turnout almost three quarters voted for a parliament, and almost two thirds for the tax powers. At the count, Dewarrsquos relief was visible.Even then battle had to be joined in Whitehall with London civil servants not in the market for readily devolving any substantial powers. The solution painstakingly devised by Dewar and his team was deceptively simple.The  Scotland Act, instead of reciting the parliamentary powers to be granted to Holyrood, merely listed anything which was to remain reserved. Everything  would be deemed devolved.Perhaps the most satisfying moment in Dewarrsquos time at the Commons dispatch box was when he read out the first lines of that document: ldquoThere shall be a Scottish parliament. ldquoI like that he added with a grin. These lines were reprised on the Holyrood Mace, the Queenrsquos gt to the new legislature.The belt and braces was intended to be the so called Sewel Convention which decreed that Westminster couldnrsquot legislate on any devolved matter without the consent of the Scottish parliament.Which is why, when the current UK government suggested post Brexit powers previously devolved would be ldquorepatriated to London rather than Edinburgh, so many Scottish ministers and MSPrsquos were spitting tacks.The state opening of the parliament on that implausibly sunny July day twenty years ago, was for Dewar, and many Scots of his and other parties, the culmination of years of backstage struggles and not a little wrangling. Labour Party being reminded by its London office that it actually favoured devolution.But it had never left the personal agendas of either Dewar or John Smith, both heavily involved in the rsquos with the Claim of Right and the Scottish Constitutional Convention. This weekend hosts two anniversaries ndash  years of the first Scottish parliament in  years, and, incredibly,  years since Smithrsquos unexpected and untimely death two years into his leadership.Smith had famously described devolution as ldquounfinished business whilst Dewarrsquos speech on that opening morning celebrated an event which was ldquonot an end in itself but a means to greater ends.Those greater ends will mean dferent things to dferent people. But not in dispute is the fact that the parliament with all its mis-steps is firmly embedded in the political fabric of Scotland still popular with the vast majority of the electorate.Everyone who was present at that opening ceremony in May  was aware of its historical signicance, not least the redoubtable Winnie Ewing, Madame Ecosse, with her killer line about the adjourned parliament of  being ldquohereby reconvened.It was an occasion devoid of the flummery of its Westminster counterpart, save for what one commentator wittily described as the ldquoplaying cards ndash the tabard sporting Lord Lyon and his two colleagues.Her Maj was in purple and green - echoes of the thistle colours, and the shiny new MSPrsquos had white heather button holes with ribbons of Flower of Scotland tartan.It was an enormously emotional day, not least when Sheena Wellington, in her electric blue suit, sang the Burns anthem which you fervently hoped would be emblematic of what followed. The incongruity of ldquothe rank is but the guinea stamp, the manrsquos the gowd for arsquo that being sweetly sung to a Queen, a couple of Dukes and a Prince of the realm was not lost on many of her audience.That night in Edinburgh Scotland partied asit had finally won the world cup.

There were absolutely, and there still are occasionally, incidences where people donrsquot take me seriously because of my age and I have to work to either prove them wrong or in some cases defeat them ndash Irsquove done that, outmanoeuvred opponents in the chamber and won a vote they didnrsquot expect.ldquoBut overwhelmingly, I was treated just as seriously as any other MSP, because on the whole I think people in here appreciate thatyoursquore here, itrsquos because thousands of people chose for you to be here.With the chamber at Holyrood designed to encourage less confrontational debate and greater compromise between dferent parties, Mr Greer agreed with the suggestion that the tone of debate in the Scotland is quite dferent to that at Westminster.:MSP pledges to deliver , objections to Loch Lomond developmentldquoTherersquos definitely a dference across the board here, he said.ldquoThe Scottish Parliament was set up deliberately to foster a culture that was about compromise and discussion and good natured debate, rather than oppositional debate.ldquoMost of what the Parliament does is actually done by consensus, but most folk wouldnrsquot know that, they wouldnrsquot expect that.ldquoMost of our committee reports are done by consensus, most legislation that we pass everyone will vote for in the end.ldquoThere will be moments that are highly contested as people are putting in ious amendments and fighting off ious amendments, but in the end, consensus is actually the majority of the work that we do and I think thatrsquos reflected across the board in the culture of the Parliament.ldquoItrsquos not always the case, and of course therersquos always going to be personalities that disagree. What you tend to find about the folk in here who donrsquot get on, is more often than not theyrsquore actually in the same party and itrsquos just personal disagreements.ldquoThe political disagreements rarely make their way out of the chamber into the rest of everyonersquos lives.Mr Greer said that although lessons could be learned from Holyrood by those at Westminster, there is still room for improvement in Edinburgh too.Referring to MPs, he said: ldquoThe traditions and procedures that theyrsquore bound by make the process more dficult, make things more tense, make it more confrontational, and thatrsquos feedback we get from our colleagues down there quite a lot.ldquoTherersquos things the Scottish Parliament could learn from Westminster, itrsquos not all one-way.ldquoBut I think our ability to foster a culture that is more often than not about consensus, evenit doesnrsquot look like that most of the time, is something that would actually do Westminster really well to even take a little bit of and to try and get that cultural change there.ldquoBut they could only do thatthey change the centuries-old procedures that are holding them back.Mr Greer also highlighted the importance of Holyrood reflecting Scottish society by ensuring that there is ersity amongst its members.ldquoParliaments are supposed to look like the society that they represent, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot yet do that here. Only a third of MSPs are women, only a couple of us are young, there are only two people from a black and ethnic minority background.ldquoWe have a long way to go but I think we have a culture in this Parliament that, while it can be improved, is inclusive enough that we can absolutely achieve those advances and we can make the Parliament look more like the society it represents."},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-chief-calls-for-re-think-of-scottish-parliaments-voting-system","story":"Sir Paul Grice said the semi-proportional system had also failed to bring about European-style co-operation between parties, partly because of Westminsterrsquos continued influence.The chief executive and clerk of the Parliament since its foundation in , Sir Paul said there was also a case for MSPs overhauling local government in the next session.The comments echo those of former first minister Lord McConnell, who recently said it was ldquounbelievable there had been no council reorganisation since the Tories were in power in the mid-s.Sir Paul, who was knighted for his services to the Parliament in , was speaking to The Herald as part of its coverage of the th anniversary of devolution.Holyroodrsquos  MSPs are elected using the Additional Member System, which gives each elector two votes, one to elect a constituency MSP and one for a regional party list. The results of the  constituency elections then decide the election of  additional, or list, MSPs ndash seven from each of the countryrsquos eight parliamentary regions.The parties are then allocated list MSPs to make the overall result more proportional, with the smaller parties ndash and occasional independents ndash more likely to get in on the list.The result is that each elector is represented by eight MSPs in total, one constituency MSP and seven list MSPs.Although the system was created at Westminster, Holyrood recently acquired the power to change its own electoral system through the  Scotland Act.Sir Paul said: ldquoItrsquos complicated system. Do people really understand  It is hard to understand drsquoHondt [the system used to allocate list seats].ldquoIt works, in the sense it retains the constituency link, which I think was felt to be important.ldquoBut itrsquos naturally a hybrid. Itrsquos not pure proportional representation . So that complexity is a question mark over it still, I think.One of the early hopes of the Scottish Parliament was that a voting system designed to result in coalitions and minorities would lead to more co-operation between parties, and less of the partisan ide entrenched at Westminster.However Sir Paul said politics at Holyrood remained influenced by Westminster.He said: ldquoThat culture of co-operation, politically, is something that is deeply rooted in many continental parliaments.ldquoWe are still essentially a British system, fundamentally, with a PR system grafted on to it. ldquoMaybe itrsquos not surprising that itrsquos taking some time to work out what exactly do we want.ldquoIs it winner takes all  Or is it this system that lsquoThere is no winner and the people who done best kind of get togetherrsquo. Irsquom not sure therersquos been enough discussion.He said the scope for genuine cross-party work was limited by the break-neck speed at which politicians and the Parliament were expected to react to election results.ldquoIf you look a continental European parliament,it meets within two or three months of an election, thatrsquos good going, he said. If wersquore not meeting within seven days my good friends on the fourth estate are saying, lsquoWhat are the politicians are up to rsquoldquoTherersquos a huge pressure immediately after elections to get on with it.ldquoIrsquom not blaming anyone . Itrsquos not even the political culture.ldquoTherersquos just a deep expectation that an election produces a winner, and they get on with it, and they have to make the best of it. Yet wersquore expecting, without a clear winner, people to build a coalition or work in a minority.ldquoI genuinely think itrsquoll take time to bed down, or there will be a bit of a dferent electoral system. What I donrsquot think will happen is that wersquoll give up and think, lsquoWell actually, letrsquos just go back to winner-takes-all, first-past-the-post.rsquo I think wersquore too far down the road.Speaking about devolution last month, Lord McConnell also said it was time to review Holyroodrsquos electoral system as voters had never been comfortable with it.He called for time limits for list MSPs, to force them to try to get elected in constituencies ldquoand build a proper relationship with the electorate instead of with the party machine.He said one reason the Parliament did not work on a cross-party basis as often as it should was ldquobecause so many members owe their place to the party rather than to the electorate, and we need to find some reforms to tackle that issue.He also said local government had become a ldquoshadow of its former self as ldquomuch of the energy has been sucked out of Scotland by the Parliament.Willie Sullivan, senior director at the Electoral Reform Society Scotland, said: ldquoTwenty years on from devolution itrsquos important to consider how Scottish democracy can evolve and improve as times change as we welcome any discussion on how this can be done.ldquoScotland is already far ahead of Westminster in using the Additional Member System for the Parliament, alongside Single Transferable Vote in local elections - leading the way in creating a balanced and more democratic chambers that are a far cry from the broken politics of first-past-the-post.ldquoItrsquos important that any electoral system in the Scottish Parliament keeps this principal of proportionality where those in power represent the views of the voters who put them there. Scotlandrsquos success since devolution has been based on this fairer and more representative politics and any changes made must keep that at its heart."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-tycoons-are-named-scotlands-richest-family","story":"Rising profits for William Grant  Sons have seen Glenn Gordon and family maintain their top spot on the Scottish Rich List, compiled by the Sunday Times, which will be published in full this weekend.The distillery group, which also produces whisky including Grantrsquos and The Balvenie, is currently run by the founderrsquos great-great-grandson, the fth generation of  founder William Grant.Mr Gordon, who is registered as a resident of Jersey, has overseen a pound million increase in the familyrsquos wealth in the last year, with profits up by . per cent at their Banffshire-based distillery.His family have more than doubled their wealth in six years, up from pound. billion in  to pound.bn, according to the paper.Oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood, worth pound.bn, has risen up a rank in the Scottish top  to take second place this year, thanks to a poundm increase.He retains a .% stake, worth pound.m, in Wood, which he founded and ran for  years before retiring in .A non-mover in fth place, Bahrain-born Mahdi al-Tajir saw falling profits of pound.m in  at his Highland Spring mineral water operation.Previously working as an ambassador to Britain for the United Arab Emirates, Al-Tajir, , has built up his UK interests in industries such as metal trading, gas and oil.The Thomson family, who were originally in shipping but now run the Dundee-based Beano publisher DC Thomson, have grown their wealth by poundm to pound.bn and sit seventh on the list.The Thomsons have continued the success of the Beano, the worldrsquos oldest weekly comic, with the infamous Dennis the Menace is currently starring in a -date UK theatre show, and Minnie the Minx has a TV show in development.People with Scottish connections account for  of the , richest people in Britain, it said, including  billionaires worth a combined pound.bn ndash a rise of pound.bn in the last year.Outside of the billionaires, Ian Taylor, who chairs the worldrsquos largest independent oil trader, Vitol, is Scotlandrsquos second highest riser this year, with poundm in wealth.Robert Watts, compiler of The Sunday Times Rich List, said: ldquoMany Rich Listers are this year nursing big losses due to the uncertainty over Brexit, turbulence on the stock market and the enormous change sweeping through our high streets.ldquoBut more than half of our Scottish Rich List have seen their fortunes rise over the past  months ndash thatrsquos a higher proportion than other parts of the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"in-full-the-10-richest-people-in-scotland-2019","story":":Whisky tycoons are named Scotlands richest familyThe billionaire whisky tycoons behind Glenfiddich and Hendrickrsquos Gin have been named Scotlandrsquos richest family for the sixth year in a row.Rising profits for William Grant  Sons have seen Glenn Gordon and family maintain their top spot on the Scottish Rich List, compiled by the Sunday Times.:Celtic ahead of Rangers in Deloittes football rich listThe top  in full.

Transport Scotland will evaluate bids received, with a view to having a new public service contract in place by  October .#Mr Wheelhouse added: #Simultaneously, Transport Scotland will continue its engagement with the European Commission to seek an early resolution to Pentland Ferries’ outstanding State aid complaint about the subsidies payable under the next public services contract.#Further information about Transport Scotland’s engagement with the Commission and any implications for the tender procedure will be announced in due course.#Responding to confirmation by the Scottish Government that the tendering of the Northern Isles ferry contract will proceed as set out in the original documentation, Orkney’s MSP Liam McArthur said: “This is welcome confirmation by the Minister that there should be no slippage in the timing for tendering the next Northern Isles ferry contract. However, the timeframe is tight and will be challenging for both bidders.“We need to see real improvements delivered through the next contract, including an increase in freight capacity and restoration of sailings on the Pentland Firth route.“Unfortunately, the Minister is unable to shed any light on when passengers on the Northern Isles routes can expect to benefit from RET. Almost a year on from the date for implementing RET, those using these leline services are still being forced to pay over the odds.

Taking inspiration from Orkney’s Norse roots, Highland Park embarked on an adventure to open the new shop, he explained.Patricia Retson, said: “It was an honour and a pleasure to open the new Highland Park store. I hope to see many more visitors discover Orkney and Highland Park’s exciting history.”Mr Craig joined Ms Retson to mark the occasion with a reading of a traditional Viking poem.Mr Craig, added: “We’re excited to open the doors to our new shop and share even more of our world with our visitors. It felt fitting, on a day believed to be about embarking on new adventures for our Nordic ancestors, that we’ve embarked on ours.”“We could think of no better ambassador to open our new store than Patricia. She retired from her role as Senior VP and Education Host at the Highland Park Distillery in April, having helped us create a multi award-winning visitor experience. Patricia’s commitment to the industry and passion for our rich history makes her a true modern day Viking Soul.”Orkney-based photographer and digital influencer Kendra Towns is the first to feature her collection of images inspired by the light on the islands.Seven new members of staff have been employed, with an additional four members joining the team during the summer season.Further details in the Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Agreement between both sides seems as far away as ever.“While any disruption to our leline services is a concern, I am alarmed that the proposed strike date clashes with the start of the Orkney Folk Festival.#This is an absolutely key event in the Orkney calendar, with performers and visitors flying in from all over the country and beyond.

There will be local support for farmers, who will be able to obtain immediate permission rather than having to apply for a specic, inidual licence, which can take around ten days.This local licence follows a new goose policy which supports efficient, practical regulation for farmers and others affected by geese grazing.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles  North Highland area manager, has said: “We realise that farmers in Orkney have been struggling with the impact of large goose numbers, and this pressure has been increasing. We’re keen to work with farmers and land managers and support them in finding sustainable solutions to managing this problem, while still making sure we fulfill our nature conservation obligations.“We have been working hard to look at ways to give farmers more flexibility. As a result, we plan to introduce a greylag goose licence for Orkney to cover the closed season from  February to  June.“For the long term, we will also be working with an extended local Goose Management Group, alongside partners in NFUS, RPID and others, to try to explore new ways of managing the problem. We will be funding and administering this through the local goose management group in Orkney.”SNH have been discussing potential management tools and the new licence with NFU Scotland representatives in Orkney. Alan Corrigall, chairman of the Orkney Branch, said: “We are grateful to SNH for making the changes that will allow shooting to take place throughout the year, where necessary. Whilst the new licence will not control geese numbers in itself, it will make much easier for those undertaking shooting to get the necessary consent between February and June.#We also look forward to working with SHN and others as we explore other ways to reduce the resident greylag goose population to lessen the environmental and economic impact of the huge numbers of geese.#Resident greylag geese in Orkney have increased over the past  years.

It is unsurprisingly the city’s favourite form of transport.Taking up far less space than cars, yet seeming to make far better progress, those on two wheels also appeared to have the upper hand from my vantage point in a museum cafe.Cyclists are not a dferent breed in Amsterdam. There are no helmets, high-visibility jackets or flashing lights. People ride in whatever they are wearing, such as smart suits, trailing overcoats and heels. Young children are strapped on, older ones just perch on the back.Riders often have one hand on their coffee or phone, or clutch their shopping, with bigger items tied on behind them.Segregated cycle lanes are commonplace on all but the narrowest streets, subtly dferently coloured than vehicle lanes.: How cycling can transform Scotland’s cities – Adrian Davis and Chris OliverIt struck me as looking like a separate road network, just for bikes – a world apart from a line of paint down the side of the street that is often the best we can do on many roads here.On off-road sections, there are even pedestrian islands so walkers can cross safely between the bikes, there are so many.This may seem a cycling paradise compared to Scottish cities, but it has been hard fought for. Tensions also remain, as I was to experience.An exhibition at the Amsterdam City Archives, which runs until the end of June, highlights the battles cycle campaigners waged against the encroachment of the car in the s and s, and for bikes to be given road space. It followed the widening of roads and the filling-in of canals to create more room for cars which just made congestion worse.Cycling is now integral to Amsterdam’s transport system, which also boasts an impressively efficient and passenger-friendly network of trams, buses and trains.There are , bikes in a city of , people, which collectively travel two million kilometres a day– or  times round the Earth.But Amsterdammers are far from cycling in perfect harmony. The exhibition demonstrates that irritations are just as much an issue there as here – cyclists ignoring red lights, riding on pavements, using their phones, and not using lights at night.: State of our cycling lanes tells dferent story to SNP rhetoric – Alastair DaltonOne of the  reads: “Some cyclists behave asthey always have priority. This behaviour gives rise to irritation between cyclists and other road users.”I can certainly vouch for that, witnessing a cyclist and taxi driver almost coming to blows when the driver suddenly stopped on a narrow canalside street and the rider tried to squeeze past. It was worse than any such road rage incident I’ve seen on this side of the North Sea.Scotland is becoming more of a cycling nation, evenit seems to be happening very slowly. More segregated lanes are being built, and there is an, often-hidden, network of off-road routes that make for even more pleasant pedalling, away from traffic noise, pollution and hazard.On roads, a critical mass has yet to be reached. Then, the sheer volume of riders would make them sufficiently conspicuous to feel able to shed their fluorescent jackets and helmets – and help normalise cycling the way it is in cities like Amsterdam.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"mps don t understand what brexit is doing to the union ayesha hazarika","story":"Some No voters can now imagine Scotland breaking away from the UK, crossing a huge psychological line in their head and their hearts, writes Ayesha Hazarika.Brexit has lit a fire across the country and I mean the whole country, although for most MPs in Westminster, that means England ... especially the North of England – an area now suddenly now being fetishised for the purposes of Brexit by the same politicians who curiously ignored and indeed damaged those communities over many decades with their lack of concern and policies.Politicians who take to the airwaves regularly in London are woefully ignorant about views from outside the bubble – particularly the anxieties and dangers stirring in Northern Ireland and, of course, the mood north of the hallowed North of England – Scotland.Last Thursday, I was up in Ayr recording Breaking the News, a BBC Scotland satirical  show expertly hosted by Des Clarke. Matt Forde, the only English list, took his le into his hands by ribbing the audience about the Scots couldn’t understand maths as they couldn’t seem to work out that they lost the independence referendum in . He got a somewhat frosty reception but being the consummate pro that he is, won them back round with a stonking William Hague impression. But there was an edge in the room.: SNP hit back at Tony Blair claims on Scottish independenceOn Saturday, tens of thousands of people marched in Glasgow as part of “All Under One Banner” to show their support for another independence referendum.I met up with a number of people who had been staunch unionist campaigners in the  referendum, but who are now seriously open-minded to the question being asked again and would consider the case for independence.I wasn’t at all surprised by the question being back on the political agenda. It never went away and the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon have never been shy about that. But I was struck by how Brexit has turbo-boosted the most potent of political weapons – emotion even amongst unionists. Something has shted.The people I spoke to made powerful, cogent, public economic arguments for staying in the union four-and-a-half years ago and they still have deep reservations about the big ticket issues – these are hardened political operators, but their mindset has shted because of how Brexit has been handled. One staunch Labour activist, who’s no fan of the SNP, said to me that the way Westminster has treated us, by ignoring us and sidelining us, shows that even after everything “they’re still no for us and we’re no part of them”.: Brexit Britain’s done it for me. Time for independence – Kevan ChristieI pointed out that surely the shambles of Brexit proved how dficult and complex it was to extricate yourself from a close geographic and economic partner and they conceded that this, of course, was the big question they and others were grappling with.But, in their head and in their heart, they could now imagine breaking away. And that was a huge psychological line for them to cross.It would be easy to scoff at this personyou didn’t know them. But that is the mistake unionists must not make. We cannot and must not make the mistakes the Remain campaign made. Yelling about the economic peril alone and calling people stupid didn’t go so well.And it’s not that those arguments are not vital but we won’t get permission to be heardwe don’t understand the genuine frustration so many Scots feel and their distance from Westminster politics.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon why the scottish parliament can inspire the world","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Parliament has been a force for good and its democratic journey is continuing, writes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.My recollections of the start of the devolution era in Scotland are vivid – for both personal and wider political and historic reasons.Personally, it was an election which saw me elected to parliament for the first time, with the profound sense of responsibility and privilege that comes with that.And for the country as a whole, it was momentous – a historic event in the purest sense of the word a moment in time which now, two decades on, seems both poignant and uplting because of the sense of possibility that having a new parliament awakened.It was only a new legislature in one sense, of course, as the first MSP to chair proceedings was quick to remind the  newly elected members as we took our seats in the Kirk’s Assembly buildings on the Mound.Winnie Ewing’s words that “The Scottish Parliament, adjourned on the th day of March in the year , is hereby reconvened” have become etched into the Holyrood story.It was an important reminder that, while this  institution was a new one, we were merely picking up a baton which had been laid down almost three centuries earlier.And, for all the teething troubles of the early days, principally the controversy over the Holyrood building itself, the Scottish Parliament has been a success story.Surveys, including some of the most detailed opinion polling, show that people across Scotland overwhelmingly identy with the Scottish Parliament, ahead of Westminster, and believe it has improved things for the better on a range of policy fronts.: Scottish Parliament at : How Holyrood forged a link with the publicHaving a parliament has brought democracy closer to the people and has allowed Scotland to take distinctive steps in areas like health and social care and the environment, among others.The ban on smoking in public places was something which led the way for the whole of the UK in an important piece of public health legislation. In the same area, the move to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol is genuinely world-leading.Meanwhile, new laws on equal marriage have shown that the parliament is capable of both keeping pace with and leading public opinion as society’s attitudes to family and social issues evolve.Scotland has been on a democratic journey for the last two decades. It is a journey which I fervently hope – and believe – will see our country become independent.That is not a view shared by all in our parliament or in the country as a whole, and I sincerely respect those dferences of opinion.Recognising and reflecting those dferences, the Scottish Government has recently proposed the establishment of a citizens’ assembly initiative similar to that which has been used successfully in Ireland in recent years.A citizens’ assembly will not be a competitor or rival to Holyrood – rather, it will complement the work of the parliament and allow the wider public the opportunity to consider the kind of country we are seeking to build.: Scottish Parliament at : Why devolution failed to ‘kill nationalism stone dead’When I was first involved in politics, in the late s and through the early and mid-s, there was a widespread consensus that the status quo was not an option. The view was that there was a profound democratic deficit which could only be addressed with the establishment of the parliament whose anniversary we are now marking.Twenty years on, there is again a growing consensus that the current situation cannot endure. This time it is a post-Brexit landscape in which our Parliament faces the prospect of having its influence diminished for the first time since , and in which even some of the most ardent unionist voices would agree that the current status quo is not an option.Scotland’s relationship with Europe has been enhanced and deepened by Holyrood over the last  years, with our laws, including environmental and employment protections, entwined and aligned with those of our European neighbours. But now we face the prospect of being taken out of the EU against the overwhelming wishes of the Scottish electorate.The weeks and months ahead will see how we address the Brexit challenge and how we, as a parliament and a nation, envisage our collective future.I believe our Parliament should be an independent one, but I do not believe that should or would be the end of its democratic journey.Already we can see how, in areas like tackling climate change, the Scottish Parliament can act as an exemplar to the rest of the world.A parliament equipped with the full powers of a sovereign nation would be able to go even further in enacting policies to help make le better for everyone who lives in Scotland.Two decades on from Holyrood’s establishment it seems almost unthinkable that we should have been without a national parliament for over  years – or that we should ever be without one again in the future.The Scottish Parliament has been a force for good, and is the most tangible manestation of the ancient Scottish constitutional principle that sovereignty must always lie in the hands of the people.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood voting system hard to understand says top official","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The system used to elect MSPs has been called into question by the head of the Scottish Parliament who admits its \"hard to understand.\"Sir Paul Grice, Holyroods chief executive, also suggested there should be a more collegiate approach between political parties under the hybrid PR first past the post system which is used.Read more: Scottish Parliament at : How Holyrood found the power to make a dferenceScots have two votes to elect their MSPs.

[]js  djs.id  idjs.src  \"embed.playbuzz \"fjs: New tram loop proposed for Edinburgh city centre and North Bridge: Car-free plaza plans for Waverley BridgeA long-term ambition to extend the tram route over North Bridge to the BioQuarter and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary is also part of the highly ambitious strategy to “create a city centre that truly puts people first”.A city centre tram loop could also be constructed, which would connect Haymarket with Morrison Street, Lauriston Place, Potterrow and Edinburgh University.The proposal comes with works due to start this month on the .-mile tramline extension down Leith Walk to Newhaven following confirmation the controversial project’s cost had grown to £ million.Under its latest plans, the council hopes to reduce city centre traffic by up to  per cent by treating cars as “guests” in a “pedestrian priority zone”. Busy routes in the Old Town would be shut to traffic, including Victoria Street, Cockburn Street and a longer stretch of the Royal Mile. Waverley Bridge could become a vehicle-free plaza, while a “centrepiece” bridge could be built for pedestrians and cyclists, connecting the Old Town and the New Town.Car parking would be gradually reduced across the city centre, with George Street, Victoria Street and Cockburn Street losing parking space altogether. There are also plans for remaining parking areas to be subject to a trial of a “parking free day” – where existing spaces are set aside for alternative uses such as street events one day per week. A free hopper bus would take people around the city centre.The proposals will go out for a public consultation for approval, subject to the thumbs up by the council’s transport and environment committee next week.Transport and environment convener Councillor Lesley Macinnes said: “This is a serious approach to how we equip the city for the future and how we meet the emerging challenges from the climate change emergency, population growth, changing expectations of our city centre and air quality.“This is a clear statement of intent about what we want to achieve in the city centre.”As part of the blueprint, there are plans to construct four lts, situated across the city centre, to help people access Edinburgh’s two levels with more ease.The lts would be provided from Market Street to the top of The Mound, Waverley Station to North Bridge, Cowgate to George IV Bridge and the Grassmarket to Edinburgh Castle.They could be used by cyclists and those with wheelchairs.Ms Macinnes said: “You will come out the back of Waverley Station and take that lt up to North Bridge. Instantly, you have got public transport with buses instantly connected with the train. It’s about collapsing the city centre to be able to access both levels.”Permission would need to be approved from the Scottish Government before proposing to take the tram over North Bridge towards Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and the BioQuarter.Indicative images show that tram stops could be provided at the university, Newington, the Chalmers Hospital and the EICC.The strategy document states: “A potential tram loop around the city centre, in association with further expansion of the network, will provide fast, reliable and high capacity access to the city centre on appropriate radial routes.”The existing timeline points to a business case being drawn up for the tram extension between  and .Key bus routes would remain across North Bridge and South Bridge and up and down The Mound. Ms Macinnes said: “The proposals are designed to prompt debate – they aren’t finalised designs or ideas. They are examples of what we could do to deliver the city centre that residents are telling us they want.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members. It gives us that bit of extra flexibility to meet the extra demand because there are days, especially in the summer, when we could have three or four flights a day.#Loganair must be given a minimum of four weeks# notice to arrange the additional flights, which will be rolled over into the following yearthey remain unused.To create the bank of  flights, the Scottish Government are to remove the second daily service on a Wednesday during January and February. The Sunday service is being increased from one to two daily flights from the end of May until the beginning of September.Mr Matheson also announced that two seats per day will be reserved on the first flight of the day from Barra to Glasgow and on the second flight of the day from Glasgow to Barra for use by passengers travelling for medical purposes. Any seats not used within three days of the date of travel are made available for general sale.The changes are part of the next contract to operate the Scottish Government-supported air routes from Glasgow to Barra, Tiree and Campbeltown. The invitation to tender for the £ million Public Service Obligation contract, which will run for four years from th October , was published on th April.Mr Matheson said: #These flights play a vital role for the remote communities they serve, so we have spoken with passengers to see how we can make improvements and will keep ticket prices low given the leline nature of the services.#The people of Barra and Tiree told us they face capacity issues over the busy summer period, so the new contract will remove a number of little-used flights to create a bank of rotations that can be deployed at the discretion of these communities.#It will also formalise a scheme for the Barra service which reserves seats for passengers travelling for medical purposes, following a successful trial.#I look forward to this contract being awarded later this year and the benefits that come with it being realised by passengers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tuv top the poll in bannside","story":"TUV leader Jim Allister has praised his Bannside candidates after they topped the poll in yesterday#s election.Stewart McDonald secured , first preference votes and his party colleague Timothy Gaston gained ,.A total of , votes were cast and  were rejected.

But he made no mention of timelines on Friday.Pressed on the timeframe, Mr Whitesides said he anticipates the first commercial flight within a year.Three people with future space-flight reservations were in the audience.“They’ve been patient too,” Sir Richard said. “Space is hard.”Hundreds of potential customers have committed as much as , dollars up front for rides in Virgin’s six-passenger rocket, which is about the size of an executive jet."},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin scores eight goals in ice hockey game","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, she also hit out at both Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill.Speaking to Channel ’s Alex Thomson Sara Canning said: “It’s been three weeks. I’ve not come to terms with it. I still expect to hear from her every morning. I expect to wake up beside her, and I don’t. You know …“The phone was out she was clicking away, she was texting, she was ringing. She’d gone into reporter mode.“We were only there in total eight minutes. That’s what the police have told us, from the minute we arrived, to the minute it happened, it’s eight minutes.“Well, initially, I… Lyra was clumsy, and I thought she’d tripped over her own feet… and I looked down, and I knew straight away that she hadn’t tripped. And then I noticed that she had a head wound and I put my hand to it and I started screaming for help.”Asked what message she had for those behind the murder Sara added: “It was so indiscriminate.“There was no regard for human le. Why are we protecting that  Andit is your child, I would be ashamed to have a child that had done that. I’d be ashamed.“They took away an amazing person. I’ve lost the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my le with. I was supposed to get engaged today in Central Park. We’d planned the rest of our lives together and in one split second some idiot with a gun took that away.“And then the mealy-mouthed apologies and back-tracking and absolutely pathetic statements that were issued by Saoradh the New IRA.“You can’t apologise for killing someone. You can’t call it an accidental shooting. You fire a gun at a crowd, that’s not an accidental shooting. You’re aiming to shoot someone. I mean, it’s ridiculous. They’re not defending anyone. They’re literally a scourge on their communities. They’re a scourge. They are a scourge.“What I would say is, and this might be heavy-handed, and people might speak out against it or whatever. But I don’t really care – they are grooming young men and women.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“They’re no better, they speak out about paedophile gangs, but they’re no better than paedophiles. They literally take young people who are disenfranchised at the best of times, who are living in poverty, who don’t see a future for themselves in Northern Ireland because there is literally very little here for them. And they tell them that the way forward is a gun in their hand. The way forward is never a gun in your hand.”Sara Canning also revealed what she told politicians who attended Lyra’s funeral in St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast by saying: “At that stage I had looked at who was in the room and I kind of saw red a little bit. So when I was speaking to Leo Varadkar, and I said you need to facilitate these people sitting down at a table.“And so I’m putting my trust in you – you’re a world leader, and you have a presence here. You need to use it for good.“So when I turned from Leo Varadkar, it was Karen Bradley, Secretary of State. Karen Bradley offered her condolences and I accepted them graciously. And I wasn’t rude. But I did tell her that she was doing a pretty terrible job as the Secretary of State. Her lack of knowledge around Northern Ireland was appalling. She needed to go and educate herself. How on earth she had taken a job where she had no knowledge of the area.“She was very gracious I have to say. She nodded and she agreed with me that she had said things that were completely misguided and that she’s gone and educated herself.“As a Derry woman, I had to say to her, to offer your condolences on Lyra when you have turned around and said that soldiers who indiscriminately opened fire in the Bogside on Bloody Sunday were doing their job in a dignied manner. I said they are no dferent to the thug that opened fire in Creggan on Holy Thursday and shot Lyra.”The young Derry woman also spoke to Theresa May at the funeral and recalled what she said to the Prime Minister: “So I basically told her that she was massively derelict in her duties to Northern Ireland and successive governments have [been]. It’s not just been the Tory government. To tell us that issues like gay marriage and abortion rights are a devolved matter is completely out of order. We’re not a devolved state anymore. We’re completely unsuccessful. It has been shown that we can’t work together –so the British government has to be our government. And they have to be our voice and they have to do better. So, that was basically the message that I left with the Prime Minister.”The words of Fr Martin McGill inside St Anne’s Cathedral reverberated around the world when he rebuked politicians in Northern Ireland for failing to talk to each other in order to revive Stormont.“I was the first on my feet. I think. I’m pretty certain I was the first on my feet. And when I applauded, I stood up and I turned my entire body, and I looked to the seats to my right. And I looked at the politicians sitting there.“What I want is, the leaders of the parties, they want broadly the same things. There are red lines and I think we need to look beyond red lines at the minute. Same sex marriage and an Irish language act are important. They are important don’t get me wrong but what’s more important is having a working government who are doing what’s right for the people of Northern Ireland. Because we are, we’ve been left adrt. There’s people missing out on operations and there’s schools missing out on funding. There’s head teachers having to go out and buy toilet roll for their primary schools, because they don’t have the funds to do that,” Sara Canning said.Finally, Sara revealed Lyra’s plans to propose marriage to her and said: ““She had planned a really elaborate proposal at a lake house, on the lake in Central Park. Which one of her best friends Ky has helped her plan.“They had a pdf file and everything. They’d gone, [into] really minute detail. It was incredibly romantic, and she was such a thoughtful person.“She put her heart and soul into everything for everybody. She was always making sure that people were okay and wanted to make everything as perfect as she could. She was really good a planning. She wasn’t great at keeping things a secret. But she was great at planning.”"},{"url":null,"title":"two car collision causing lengthy tailbacks buncrana","story":"There a y tailbacks on the Buncrana Road in Derry due to a two-car collision.The crash has occurred close to St Columbs College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIt is understood no one has been injured.The road is expected to be cleared shortly."},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/9837501.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Calls for tougher sentences for fly-tippers as incidents rise %AccidentSNP failing to deliver on vow to tackle health inequalities – ToriesAccident\"\"\"Teaching event to focus on pupils with additional support needsAccident\"\"\"Paedophile hunters are destroying families ‘in the name of Facebook likes’Accident\"\"\"Virgin Galactic moves rocket to New Mexico ahead of first space tourism flightAccident\"\"\"BBC pulls Have I Got News For You over Heidi Allen impartialityAccident\"\"\"Uber shares close down % amid doubts over future profitabilityAccident\"\"\"Vladimir Putin scores eight goals in ice hockey gameAccident\"\"\"Allegation received by police about Danny Baker tweetAccident\"\"\"Sale of Harold Wilson’s personal items tops £,Accident\"\"\"Two men charged in connection with McKee murder investigationAccident\"\"\"Motorcyclist dies after road crashAccident\"\"\"Man on murder charge over disappearance of Emma FauldsAccident\"\"\"William joins England manager and footballers for mental health chatAccident\"\"\"Fracas after bid to hurl milkshake at Ukip candidate Carl BenjaminAccident\"\"\"Comedian Freddie Starr dies of heart disease aged Accident\"\"\"Guns N’ Roses clash with brewery over beer and bandanasAccident\"\"\"Javid tells Tories to back May’s deal or risk losing Brexit altogetherAccident\"\"\"Man, , abseils ft down side of London hospital for charityAccident\"\"\"George Mitchell recalls how three-month mission to NI led to five-year stintAccident\"\"\"Murder victim among eight people police failed to warn about serious threatsAccident\"\"\"Two-thirds of teachers say job has damaged their mental health – surveyAccident\"\"\"Change UK sets out European election manestoAccident\"\"\"Lecturers to strike next week after pay talks break downAccident\"\"\"George Mitchell: NI political leaders should be capable of reaching dealAccident\"\"\"Uber begins trading nearly % below IPO priceAccident\"\"\"Rogue police officers jailed for sabotaging child abuse investigationsAccident\"\"\"Centre to explore radical ways to tackle climate changeAccident\"\"\"Rare Irish Proclamation sells for almost , euro at auctionAccident\"\"\"No Archie in top US baby names but Meghan rising fastAccident\"\"\"Murdered we depressed husband did not want children with her, jury toldAccident\"\"\"London Bridge attack victim’s fiance asked man to stop filming, inquest toldAccident\"\"\"Man hunted over racist threats on trainAccident\"\"\"Businessman who ‘robbed community of investment’ jailed for £.m fraudAccident\"\"\"Police fear workplace parking levy will ‘increase risks’ to officersAccident\"\"\"Rihanna to launch new fashion label with LVMHAccident\"\"\"Murder accused ‘didn’t want to be seen’ with schoolgirl who was later found deadAccident\"\"\"Paratroopers showed great restraint in Ballymurphy, inquest hearsAccident\"\"\"France threatens new rules on Facebook amid Zuckerberg visitAccident\"\"\"Prison officers to vote on industrial action in pay rowAccident\"\"\"Brexit: The past seven daysAccident\"\"\"Boy ‘not thinking’ when he flicked cheese at pupil with allergy, inquest toldAccident\"\"\"Plans for Maze prison peace centre ‘set aside’Accident\"\"\"Irish president criticises those who perpetuated and ignored institutional abuseAccident\"\"\"Clutha helicopter pilot was safe pair of hands, inquiry toldAccident\"\"\"Elderly driver killed in road crashAccident\"\"\"Judge gives mentally disabled man go-ahead to marryAccident\"\"\"EU negotiator Guy Verhofstadt joins Lib Dems on campaign trailAccidentGet involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

He said people were really concerned about bread and butter issues, with his election result a far cry from his performance five years ago when, remarkably, he was the last of the councilrsquos  members to be elected.Tinnelly said be believed he had received the support of the electorate as he was a ldquohard working, diligent councillor looking after local issues with people on the ground.His election last Friday night came as McMahon, a Ukrainian-born Sinn Fein councillor lost her seat after just one term, with Carr, a veteran of many elections, also bowing out.Independents certainly made their mark in Crotlieve with former Sinn Fein member Mark Gibbons securing a seat after polling an impressive , first preference votes.Indeed the performance of Jarlath Tinnelly and Gibbons, alongside that of Jim Boylan, who failed to secure a seat, saw the Independents claim almost a % share of the vote.Elsewhere, Sinn Feinrsquos Gerry OrsquoHare secured a seat after polling , first preference votes as did Warrenpointrsquos Mickey Ruane who polled  first preference votes.While rumours were circulating in the count centre that Ruane was under pressure and may not make it, he secured a seat and is expected to resume his position as the councilrsquos Sinn Fein leader.Despite losing veteran Carr, the SDLP was delighted totwo councillors in Crotlieve.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

At the moment the money will have to come from local rates, although Down councillors are anxiously looking for Government grant aid.This week they were warned that thatfinal repair work is not carried out this summer a large section of the wall could be washed into the sea.Council workmen are currently completing a pound, lsquoholding operationrsquo on the wall and  tons of boulders were brought to the site this week.However, a consultant engineer appointed by Down Council, warned that the wall was continuing to slide in the sea and that fresh cracks were appearing at the base.He said temporary measures had been essential, but warned thatpermanent work was not carried out he could not guarantee the wall would still be standing next summer.Mr Seamus Byrne, council clerk, explained that repair work was not normally covered by grant aid, but he had written to the Department of Environment and was awaiting a reply.Newcastle councillor Norman Bicker reminded councillors that another section of the wall, beside the damaged section, belonged to the Department of Environment and this was also beginning to crack.He felt that since the council had attended to short term measures on the council-owned section, the Department should be taking steps to repair the damage to its section.STRANGFORD mdash Dympna Marron, from Myra Road, Strangford, finished third overall in theNurse of the Year finals. Staff Nurse Dympna, who works at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, set out for London last week to face up to the challenges of  others in similar careers, but with many more years of experience.Dympna did nothome with the crown, but she was placed third mdash a wonderful achievement considering she is so young. In fact, she is the youngest nurse to compete for the coveted title, which was televised nationally.ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed the experience, said Dympna, who took home a television set, a cheque for pound and a bottle of champagne. ldquoAll the nurses taking part in the final were delightful.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

Tickets are pound each and will be available at agricultural shows, including Balmoral Show which begins today.Kerry Angus, of the NI Kerry Hill Sheep Society, thanked all the local businesses who donated prizes for the raffle and said Mr Smythrsquos family and the society were overwhelmed by their generosity.Kerry said: ldquoPatrick was born in Leitrim and went to Legananny Primary School before going to St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, where he formed friendships that would last a letime.ldquoPatrick joined the emerging Leitrim Fontenoys Marching Band and toured the country with his best mate Martin OrsquoHare as a drummer in the early rsquos and it was around this time that he met his we, Bridie.ldquoThey finally married in May  and for the first year Patrick put his talents to work in building their family home on the site of the old Leitrim Post Office formerly owned by his grandfather.ldquoBy  they had three daughters Niamh, Aoe and Kyla.

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

Dogs and their human companions are being invited to Dogs Trust Ballymenas Family Fun Day at the Ballee Playing Fields on May .All proceeds from the day will go towards the continued care of residents at the Rehoming Centre, located outside the town at Teeshan.This year’s event will also mark the first ‘Doggy Olympics’ which will be held by Dogs Trust’s Dog School team in Northern Ireland. This will include an Olympic Dash course which has fun challenges for owners and their dogs to complete such as the loose lead egg and spoon race, with prizes up for grabs. Owners can also enter into a ‘Best trick of the day’ competition.Other activities available will include a Doggy Dash, a raffle, ious stalls and Dogs Trust Tombola. There will be Canine Carers on hand to offer rehoming advice, free microchipping and a Dogs Trust Reunion.Dogs Trust Ballymena Supporter Relations Officer Samuel Reid said: “Everything we do is for our rescue dogs and we hope you and your four-legged friends can join us on the day and show your support. It’s a fantastic opportunity to meet local dog lovers and raise pounds for the hounds in our care as the proceeds from the day help us to care for dogs like five-year-old Lurcher cross Banjo , currently staying at the Rehoming Centre.”Entry is £ per adult and children are free but encouraged to donate one tin of dog food.

Political commentator and former Sinn Fein election candidate Chris Donnelly tweeted: “Sinn Fein apparently abuse rights by supporting rights. A stretch for students of logic, but the target audience are those in audible reach of the drumbeat.”One response to Mr Donnelly’s tweet dismissed Prof Dickson’s views as “blinkered, intellectual bluster” and said there were “inexplicable barriers being placed in the way of rights”.Another accused him of being “opposed to the very concept of human rights”.Prof Dickson defended his assertions today on the BBC NI Talkback programme.He said he “takes exception to the idea that there has to some sort of guarantee” that the right to same-sex marriage and Irish language must be guaranteed before Stormont can be restored.“It is subordinating the right to government to other more specic rights.“It’s not what the Good Friday Agreement was set up for in fact, it’s the exact opposite of that.”Prof Dickson added: “You could argue that under the conventionthat it is a breach of the Convention, because Article  of the convention says that a right should not be used in a way that denies other rights.“To me that is what is happening here.”On the same programme, nationalist commentator Brian Feeney described Prof Dickson’s argument as “intellectually impoverished”.UUP: Plans for peace centre at former Maze Prison site have been scrapped Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said: “There is a government here – it’s called the British Government.

England will introduce a similar bill in .A public consultation, carried out in Wales in November  and published in January , found that out of , responses,  per cent of responses were behind a ban on wild animals in circuses.But a total of , of these responses were identical, from campaign group Born Free.More than  local authorities in the UK have a ban on animals in circuses, but the Vale council is not among them. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Eastbrook is dficult for people with walking dficulties or with little children due to the steep footbridge.ldquoWhen Plaid submitted a bid for improvements at Eastbrook we pointed out that although passengers could travel in one direction to either say Cardf or Barry thejourney could cause problems.Fellow Plaid Community Councillor Richard Grigg expressed his disappointment at the decision saying there are too many obstructions in public transport.He said: ldquoEastbrook is not the only station that has problems. The level crossing near Brookside is also not fit for purpose.ldquoOver the years Wales has suffered a massive lack of investment in rail services.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
