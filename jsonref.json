The baby boy strapped into the back seat escaped serious injury. Both drivers were breath-tested and provided negative readings.The very next day, the Queen was spotted driving on a public road without a seatbelt.          The Queen was spotted driving her Range Rover without a seatbelt on January 18, 2019, the day after Prince Philip\u0027s crash, little more than a mile from the scene of her husband\u0027s accident          But when they came to Windsor for Christmas dinner in December the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were safely belted upRoyals \u0027have seatbelt alarms disabled by Land Rover to make...\u0027He was coming straight at me!\u0027: Archive footage emerges of...Share this articleThe 92-year-old monarch was on a road near Sandringham on Friday 18, little more than a mile from the scene of her husband\u0027s accident.She learned to drive with the Army in 1945, before she became Queen, and does not need a licence. Under UK law it is compulsory to wear a seatbelt if there is one fitted but the Queen is immune from any civil or criminal proceedings - since British courts operate in her name and she cannot prosecute herself.The day after that, the Prince was snapped behind the wheel of a hastily-delivered replacement Land Rover, without a legally-mandated seatbelt.           Prince Philip (pictured) was spotted behind the wheel of his brand new Land Rover on Saturday just two days after flipping his car in a horror crash with no seatbelt on      Prince Philip at the wheel of his car at the Windsor Horse Show in 1991, without a seatbelt          Prince Philip was at the wheel driving the Queen, Prince Edward, and his then girlfriend Sophie Rhys Jones to church at Windsor Castle in 1995 but none of the royals seem to be strapped in          The Queen\u0027s eyes were locked on the road at Sandringham in 1995 but her seatbelt was not locked into place          The Prince\u0027s seat belt hung loosely behind him, as he drove the Queen out of Windsor Castle in their British racing green Jaguar  April 2002  The Duke of Edinburgh likes to be the one to drive his wife to royal engagements but often, as in this 2003 photograph, (left) he is snapped not wearing a seatbelt. And in February 2002 (pictured right) he and the Queen drove back to Windsor Castle after attending church at the royal lodge but the Queen was not wearing her seatbelt          At the same event two years later the Queen was once again at the wheel unharnessed          The Queen was pictured without a seatbelt arriving to give her pointed speech about compromise, widely believed to be directed at politicians fighting about Brexit, at the Sandringham Women\u0027s Institute (WI) meeting at West Newton Village Hall this weekThe Queen\u0027s children have a mixed record when it comes to buckling up, with some seeming to be much more conscientious than others.Prince Andrew has been seen wearing his seatbelt on numerous occasions, but his older sister Princess Anne seems to take things less seriously.Prince Charles tends to buckle up these days but was more lax in the 1980s as this photograph shows.          In this undated file photograph Princes Charles looks to be enjoying driving his Aston Martin without a seatbelt. The D prefix on the number plate means this photograph cannot pre-date 1986 - a full three years after it became law for drivers to wear seatbelts          Several years later with his teenage sons in the back the Prince of Wales was buckled up for the journey to the Easter service at Crathie Kirk in Balmoral          A lavish dinner was held in 2007 to mark the then-forthcoming diamond wedding anniversary of the Queen and Prince Philip. Princess Anne arrived at Clarence House without a seat belt on          Princess Anne was chauffeured to family Christmas  last December but relaxed in the back of her Bentley without a belt for safety          On the day of Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding her family - Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson, and Princess Beatrice - all went unbuckled too          Prince Edward drove his rover away from the Hyatt Carlton Hotel in London safely strapped in          Prince Andrew buckled up safely to drive his friends away from The Rock nightclub in London          But Prince Andrew seems not to have strapped himself in, in the back seat, leaving churchIf the Queen and Prince Philip seem to have the most lax attitude to strapping in, and their children can be a little hit-and-miss, the younger generation of royals seem much more consistent in their approach to road safety.At the wedding of the now Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, the happy couple drove a vintage Aston Martin without either belting up. And last year Harry and Meghan also took to an open-topped car in order to smile and wave at well-wishers without seatbelts on.On one or two other occasions the Cambridges and the Sussexes have been spotted without their belts on, but in the main the couples seem to be happy to strap in.          The future king in military uniform and his bride in her wedding dress waved to crowds with the roof of their convertible down - but were not buckled up          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were all smiles behind the wheel on their wedding day in May 2018 but neither Harry nor Meghan seem to be wearing a seatbelt  In 2017 (left, in London) and again last year (right, in Norway) the Duchess of Cambridge was spotted without a seatbelt on          But when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive for Prince of Wales 70th party both were safely strapped in          This picture from a car journey back from the Queen\u0027s Christmas lunch may feature some revealing facial expressions - but at least William looks to be wearing his seatbelt  Kate\u0027s seatbelt is clearly visible across her bold pink ensemble worn in December 2018   The Duchess of Sussex arrived at the same event last month safely strapped in to her seat          Harry\u0027s seatbelt is clearly visible across his shoulder as he and his wife arrive for Christmas lunch with his family Former royal protection officer Simon Morgan, told Hello magazine earlier this month that sometimes royals go belt-less for their own safety, for example if they might need to make a quick escape.He said: \u0027There are always anomalies. In the threat and risk matrix it\u0027s a matter of looking at each inidual situation to decide what is the best way of achieving what needs to be achieved.\u0027For example, considering that a quick entry or exit to a vehicle is easier when people aren\u0027t strapped into seatbelts.\u0027He suggested sometimes personal preference was allowed to trump the law of the land, however, adding: \u0027Is an inidual\u0027s look and appearance important? And also an inidual\u0027s choice\u0027.Prince Philip was described as \u0027conscious but very shocked and shaken\u0027 after a dramatic crash near his Sandringham Estate which left two women in the other vehicle in hospital and the Land Rover he was driving on its side in a crumpled heap   Philip is believed to have just left Sandringham, circled red, and was turning on to the A149  at this junction when he collided with a Kia and his car cartwheeled on to the other side of the road, circled blue  Norfolk Police have declined to ulge details of the crash investigation, saying it was \u0027ongoing\u0027. But they have confirmed they carried out an eyesight test which the Prince passed. It is understood the Duke was asked to read a number plate from 65ft away.Cameras fitted to Royal cars for security reasons are thought to be able to record and transmit live images to personal protection officers. It is understood that the cameras on Philip\u0027s Land Rover were filming from several angles as the accident unfolded.If the footage suggests that Philip was at fault and driving carelessly, then it could be used as evidence in a prosecution. Magistrates would have the power to fine him £5,000, disqualify him from driving or put nine penalty points on his licence.

And it is no surprise that, with Bohemian Rhapsody being an award-winning hit, this homophobic smear piece has been conveniently timed to take advantage of its success.\u0027Four new men have come forward to share their stories, which are remarkably similar to those shared by a number of men in the past.The youngest accuser claims that he was just 13 when Singer molested him on a film set, while others recount being plied with drugs and alcohol before being led to a bedroom by the director.That youngest victim said that as he watched the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfold, he started to thing: \u0027Me too—only I was a kid.\u0027Among the men speaking out is Victor Valdovinos, who claims that he was 13 when Singer, then in his 30s, molested him on the set of Apt Pupil.He claims that Singer first approached him in a bathroom at his school, and then asked him to be in the film. Valdovinos arrived on the set the next day only to be told to strip, put on a towel and then hidden away in a room.   \u0027I’m hanging out. All of a sudden, Bryan comes in. He goes, ‘Hey! How are you? Real cheerful. And I’m like, Hi,\u0027 said Valdovinos.           Him too: A British John Doe (above) who claims Singer raped him in London \u0027I can’t remember his exact words, but he was kind of just saying Come back here. He kind of directs me he kind of grabs me and he takes us to the back area, which was kind of closed off. \u0027He went on to say: \u0027I was back here, in the towel, with no shirt and no clothes on, sitting on one of the locker-room benches. Bryan’s like, Just hang out here. It’s going to be all day. Don’t worry.\u0027Singer allegedly paid multiple visits to the seventh-grade student throughout the day.\u0027Every time he had a chance - three times - he would go back there\u0027 claimed Valdoinos. \u0027He was always touching my chest.\u0027Then, at one point, Singer allegedly \u0027grabbed my genitals and started masturbating it\u0027 and then \u0027rubbed his front part on me,.\u0027Valdoinos said: \u0027He did it all with this smile.\u0027He also allegedly told the boy: \u0027You’re so good-looking … I really want to work with you … I have a nice Ferrari … I’m going to take care of you.\u0027Valdoinos said he was \u0027frozen speechless,\u0027 and alleged that Singer returned three times throughout the day. Within a few years he was a father after getting his teenage girlfriend pregnant, and went from being an Honor\u0027s student to failing his classes. He dropped out, was arrested on battery and drug possession charges, and eventually served time in prison.\u0027What if he never did this to me—would I be a different person? Would I be more successful? Would I be married?\u0027 wondered Valdoinos.   Alleged victim: One of the accusers alleged that Singer had a relationship with the late actor Brad Renfro (left in Singer\u0027s 1998 film Apt Pupil), right being arrested for trying to purchase heroin in 2005)          Firing back: Singer has denied all allegations of rape, molestation, or engaging in inappropriate contact with a minor (Singer above with former lover Bret Tyler)          The allegations against Singer were first reported back in 2014 when Michael Egan (above) accused the director of rape.Another accuser, who did not want to use his real name, said he was kicked out of his home at 16 because he was gay, and that was how he came to meet Singer. They made out once when he was 16 said the accuser, who also alleged that the pair  had oral sex when he was 17 or 18 at one of Singer\u0027s parties. \u0027He would stick his hands down your pants without your consent,\u0027 he claimed. \u0027He was predatory in that he would ply people with alcohol and drugs and then have sex with them.\u0027Another accuser, referred to as Andy, said he came to meet Singer after he was allegedly raped by Marc Collins-Rector multiple times. That all started when Andy was just 14, and he claims that was soon being flown on private planes to see Rector from his home in Las Vegas. He met Singer at a party while the director was with Brad Renfro, who passed away in 2008 at the age of 25 from a heroin overdose.The three men went to a room, where Andy alleges he was raped by Singer.\u0027Bryan knew I was 15,\u0027 said Andy.\u0027I remember wanting Brad to join in. I don’t think Brad was gay, or even bi. I think he was going with the flow. We talked about it. Like me, he looked around at all of the things these guys had, all of the money. Maybe he thought the guys were going to do things for him.\u0027He also claimed that Singer did not try and hide what as happening in the room. \u0027I just remember how loud the moaning was. I remember thinking, God, there’s a big group of people downstairs hanging out in the living room, and they can probably hear him,\u0027 aid Andy. \u0027That bothered me, so I stuck my hand over his mouth or in his mouth just to stop it. When we went downstairs, it was really awkward. I just acted like it was no big thing.\u0027This happened a few more times he claimed, and a few years later Singer allegedly lost interest in Andy. He began to abuse drugs, and would come to call on Singer for money at times.Andy eventually checked into court-ordered rehab however and has now been clean for two years. \u0027I sort of wonder, if I’d never met Marc and then Bryan, if I would have ever got into the drugs,\u0027 said Andy.          No idea: The producers and actors who worked on Bohemian Rhapsody claim that they were unaware of the allegations against Singer (cast and crew above accepting the Golden Globe for Best Picture)          Accuser: Victor Valdovinos (above) claims that he was 13 when Singer, then in his 30s, molested him on the set of Apt PupilEric, who also asked that his name be withheld, alleged that he was just 17 when he had sex with a 31-year-old Singer.He claimed that Singer was surrounded by two types of young men.\u0027If you weren’t young and cute enough to be their boy, you could still ingratiate yourself by bringing boys to them,\u0027 he said of Singer and his cohorts. They had a sexual relationship for five years according to Eric, until Singer lost interest in him.\u0027I never want people to think of me as a victim, so I always put up the front of I’m good. I was in charge,\u0027 said Eric.\u0027But I spent a decade in therapy trying to figure out if what happened was bad or not bad. And if it was bad, was it my fault? What I’ve decided is that adults are supposed to look out for kids.\u0027He also said that he is now in Alcoholic\u0027s Anonymous, where he allegedly runs into a number of Singer\u0027s former boys. \u0027There’s a bunch of us\u0027 he said.\u0027It’s like, You were one of Singer’s boys? Me too.\u0027 Gabe Hoffman of An Open Secret also responded to the allegations, telling DailyMail.com: \u0027In October 2018, after Bryan Singer\u0027s false attack on Alex and Max\u0027s work - I personally offered to buy, insure, and bankroll the story if Esquire ever did not want it.

It can even be worth spending a little ‘dressing’ the property for viewings, including giving it a deep clean, tidying up paintwork and bringing in some colourful cushions and throws to lift the way a rooms looks.● If you’re selling, be patient. It takes an average of 19 weeks to sell a property, so don’t lose heart.● Buyers have a fantastic choice of low-cost mortgages. It is possible that interest rates will go down later in the year if Brexit really begins to bite, so you could risk a tracker loan, which tracks the Bank of England base rate. However, if you’re a first-time buyer, you’ll need to keep on top of costs for the first few years so a fixed-rate mortgage would be best. As mortgages are still at a historic low, it could be worth going for a long deal, such as a five-year fixed offered by the Halifax and Yorkshire Building Society.● The Help To Buy scheme, where you have to put down only a five per cent deposit and the Government lends you more to help you get a cheaper mortgage, is being extended until 2023. But from 2021 only first-time buyers will be able to access it. So if you’re moving and happy to purchase a new-build (that’s one of the rules), aim to move this year or next."},{"url":null,"title":"Spooky Gothic style home comes keys graveyard door","story":"    The spooky home was constructed as a cemetery lodge in 1854 and offers house hunters the chance of a dead good deal          A key to the graveyard gates will also be handed to the new owners in case they hear a peep from next doorThe underground world the Cold War forgot: Eerie images show...Overnight millionaires and a creator so mysterious no one...Swastikas, zombies and skeletons: Villagers dress up in...Share this article    The Grade II listed property, which is up for auction with a £150,000 guide price, has two bedrooms and sits in the grounds of Chepstow cemetery in Monmouthshire          There\u0027s not a ghost of chance new owners will be disturbed by noisy residents in the neighbouring plots (pictured: The property\u0027s kitchen)There\u0027s not a ghost of chance new owners will be disturbed by noisy residents in the neighbouring plots.The  lodge may have been previously used by the cemetery sexton who maintained the graveyard. Paul Fosh, owner of Paul Fosh Auctions, said: \u0027This lodge would appear to be the perfect period property for those looking to get away from noisy neighbours.\u0027The Grade II listed freehold detached building, built in 1854 with more modern additions added in the sixties and more recently, is positioned at the entrance to Chepstow cemetery.

IT’s JUST BIOLOGYKatharine Graves, hypnobirthing expertCradling a bump is something that’s hardwired into women from a biological perspective.Women are instinctively drawn to touching their babies because, even when they’re in the womb, it produces a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone is known as the bonding hormone, but it also affects the strength of your contractions in labour.The more oxytocin in your system, the stronger your contractions will be, which can lead to an easier birth. Placing your hands on your bump comforts the baby, comforts you, and helps create the optimum conditions for labour.kghypnobirthing.com  The left hand touch: Cusping baby in London last month (right), in Birkenhead, (centre), and with Harry in Australia (left)DUCHESS OF SHOWBIZ IS JUST SEEKING A PHOTO OP Jo Elvin, Editor of You MagazineI’ve tried not to find it annoying, but I’m sorry, it just is.

I’m getting arm aches just looking. It’s all very Baby Bump Barbie.Kinder people would point to an excited new mother’s natural, unconditional love already blossoming. True enough, in which case I hope its sibling isn’t far behind, or that poor kid’s clearly in for a smothering.But come on, this is the Duchess of Showbiz we have here. It smacks to me of a focus that’s contrived and relentlessly photo-op ready. Meghan would be well advised to take the ‘world’s only pregnant woman!’ vibes down a notch or two.

As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so?This doesn’t look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body.          The handbag shield: Meghan covers the bump with her clutch bag in  in Fiji  Ultimate Accessory: Meghan covers the bump with her handbag in London this month (right) and in October (left)A SIGN OF HER DELIGHT AT BEING PREGNANT Alexandra Shulman, Mos columnistA lot of women feel comforted by touching their baby bump but Meghan appears to indulge more than most. It happened even before she had a discernible bump, and I imagine some of this is because she is so delighted to be pregnant. Possibly, at 37, she wasn’t sure it would happen so quickly.But there may be another story. All Royals have a method of preventing their arms from flailing around in a chaotic fashion when they are out and about. Meghan is using her bump as a way to keep her hands calm, while showing how protective she is.SHE LOOKS AS DEMURE AS THE VIRGIN MARY Alison Jackson, photographer Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnant, rather than just looking large. I think she’s also very consciously making the effort to break up the solid colour of her outfits.After years as an actress, she’ll be very aware of camera angles and how to work them, and how to create flattering shapes with her body.I also think she resembles the image of the Virgin Mary: demure and regal, carrying the most precious cargo. She’s definitely very pleased with herself about that.instagram.comalisonjacksonartist          Photographer Alison Jackson says Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnantIGNORE THE BACKLASH, THIS IS A BIG POSITIVE Julianne Boutaleb, psycholgistIt’s interesting to see such a backlash against a woman who is interacting with her bump in this way. But I see it as a very positive thing. It indicates a good attachment to the unborn baby.I work with a lot of women who struggle to develop a bond with their child, whether due to difficulty conceiving, miscarriage, or birth trauma. But a woman who is cradling her bump is showing that she’s very engaged, both emotionally and physically, with her unborn child.parenthoodinmind.co.uk    Psychologist Julianne Boutaleb sees it as a very positive thing and it indicates a good attachment to the unborn babyIT’S MEGHAN’S CLOAK OF INVULNERABILITY Linda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan  Everyone else constantly paws you when you’re pregnant, so why shouldn’t Meghan take things into her own hands? Personally, I’ve never felt as strong and invulnerable as when my belly was ballooning.I would march into meetings with my doctor, feeling nothing he could say could burst my sense of well-being. And in case he missed the point I’d cradle my belly for added effect.Meghan has had a hard time of it lately with attacks on a number of fronts. But when you’re pregnant and loving it nothing else really matters.Every time she cradles her bump, it’s a case of you and me against the world, babe – and she’s rocking it.IF THIS IS HER ACTING, IT’s A MASSIVE CLICHE Dee Cannon, acting coachWhen you’re teaching an actor to ‘play’ pregnant, the preparation involves holding the back. Cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a cliche. So when a woman is doing that in real life, you can choose to interpret it in either a positive or a negative way – either it’s a subconscious, instinctive, nurturing, maternal gesture, or they’re proud and overly protective.deecannon.com          Acting coach Dee Cannon says cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a clicheWHAT’S SO UNNATURAL IN LOVING YOUR BUMP?Bonita Turner, editor of Junior Magazine I imagine it’s reassuring for Meghan to put her hands on her baby. I don’t think she’s doing it to show off, and I imagine that people saying that have never been pregnant. It’s natural to be proud of your bump. You only have it for nine months and it is quite special.CONSTANT STROKING IS HELPING BABY LEARN Tamara Bugembe, paediatrician WE HAVE known for a long time that babies respond to voices and sounds from outside the womb, and they also move their arms, head and mouths more when the bump was stroked. Some babies would reach out and touch the walls of the uterus.Touching your bump is good for the baby’s development. Meghan may not know it, but her constant stroking and rubbing is helping develop the baby’s co-ordination and movements.drtamarab.comA POSITIVE SIGN SHE LOVES HER NEW BODY Holli Rubin, body image expertSome women love how they look when pregnant. Others hate it. A woman’s body image pre-pregnancy very much influences how she feels, looks and presents herself. When we feel good in ourselves, we tend to present ourselves in a very different way to when we don’t – and putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive sign.hollirubin.com          Body image expert Holli Rubin says putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive signMAKING THE MOST OF HER NEW SHAPE Renee Rispin, stylist \u0026amp blogger Some women find it hard to make the most of their changing body shape and hide their bumps – but Meghan isn’t one of them. Choosing to wear striking colours such as the purple dress and red coat she wore on a recent visit to Birkenhead is a clear message that not only does she want to show off her bump, but also that being pregnant doesn’t mean she’s taken her finger off the fashion pulse.mummystyle.co.ukSHE LOVES TO SHOW THAT SHE’S A ‘FAT LADY’ Katie Nicholl, royal authorHaving observed Meghan on official engagements, her bump patting seems to be second nature – it’s her new prop.It’s endearing, but a little distracting.

It’s called Socialism’.Last night, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the UK would recognise Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president if fair elections were not announced within eight days. The move marks a ratcheting-up of pressure on Maduro, who faces international demands to give way to Mr Guaido, head of the country’s national assembly.Mr Hunt tweeted: ‘After banning opposition candidates, ballot box stuffing and counting irregularities in a deeply flawed election, it is clear Nicolas Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela.’And in a dig at the Labour leader, Mr Hunt added: ‘Wonder how proud Jeremy Corbyn is of ringing Nicolas Maduro on live TV to congratulate him on his victory?’US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday called on countries to ‘pick a side’ on Venezuela, urging them to back Mr Guaido.‘Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side.

Her most famous images – Chicken Knickers, in which she attached an oven-ready bird, cavity gaping, to her crotch, or Self-Portrait with Fried Eggs, where a pair of the latter lay on her T-shirted chest, below the ultimate “what you looking at? stare – asked blunt questions about the objectification of women, and the predictable appetite of the male gaze.Others, like this one, the first of three pictures entitled Got a Salmon On played with cliches of masculine prowess, to pointed comic effect. Lucas hoists the fat fish on her shoulder like a floppy rifle. She’s outside the barred-up gents in her oversized double-breasted pinstripe jacket and spit-and-polished boots. The title of the picture echoes a sexual boast, hints at a female equivalent, and captures some of the absurdity of such phrasing. Unusually, for Lucas, her eyes fix not on us but down on the salmon she stands awkwardly, likably, trying to get a proper grip of the big fish and her slippery metaphors (by number three in the series, she has got the fish in place and stands, dark-eyed, to attention by the wall).The picture is included in an exhibition featuring more than a century of British women photographers subtitled A History of British Trailblazers. Lucas lines up alongside pioneers such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Lee Miller, as well as fellow former YBAs Sam Taylor-Wood and Gillian Wearing.

They never fail to shock me with all the things they say, and all the things they don’t.Going right back to the start, I try to picture myself on the day I first decided to keep a diary: 29 December 1975, when I was 13 years old. I must have been given it as a Christmas present, and although it was for the year 1976, its first few pages invited entries for the end of the previous year. So I began as the old year ended, just before it turned to face the new.29 December 1975 – “Went to St Albans with Debbie. Got a belt. Could not get a jumper or skirt.”That’s it, that’s all she wrote. No starting with a bang, no announcing herself to the world, or to a future reader, no declaration of intent. Nothing along the lines of “Dear Diary, draw closer and listen to what I have to say. Here I am this is me let me tell you the story of my life.” Not even the guileless enthusiasm of a 13-year-old self-introduction – “Hello, I’m Tracey and this is my diary.” Instead, I draw a circle and leave it empty, my eye caught by an absence. And it wasn’t an aberration I carried on in that style for years, making countless entries about not buying things, not going to the disco, not going to school, a piano lesson being cancelled, the school coach not arriving. It’s a life described by what’s missing, and what fails to happen.My second ever entry is just as banal:30 December – “Went to Welwyn with Liz. Didn’t get anything except a bag of Kentucky chips.”Was it me or was it my surroundings? Was it just that I was the dullest child in existence, noticing nothing, experiencing nothing, thinking nothing, or was it at least in part an embodiment of something in the air, something vague and undefined? Even when I write about it now, I realise that the time and place in which I grew up, 1970s suburbia, is easier to define by saying what it wasn’t than what it was. Brookmans Park was a village but not a village. Rural but not rural. A stop on the line, a space in between two landscapes that are both more highly rated – the city, and the countryside. A contingent, liminal, border territory. In-betweenland.1 January 1977 – “Went to Welwyn with Mum and Dad to get some boots but couldn’t get any.”8 January – “Liz and I went to Potters Bar in the afternoon to try to get her ears pierced, but she couldn’t.”Anywhere with a tube station, however “end of the line” that stop may be, still feels to me like part of London, physically linked by the tunnels and rails. Things would still happen there. But beyond the reach of the underground lies a different and less certain terrain. Where things might not happen at all. Where you might continually try but continually fail, in endless small endeavours.19 January 1979 – “Deb and I went to St Albans. Tried to get some black trousers but couldn’t find any nice ones.”17 March – “Tried to go to the library but it was shut.”When I came to write a song about the place, Oxford Street, I fell back into this habit of describing by subtraction, stating what wasn’t there – “Where I grew up there were no factories”’ – and only then going on to admit that “there was a school and shops, and some fields and trees”. But although there were fields, there was no agricultural life. No one worked as a farmer. All the men got on the train every morning with a briefcase to go up to town. Nature writers would have found little there to describe it was not a place of shepherds, or hawks. There was no real scenery – no hills, or lakes, nothing in the way of a view.Here I am again, talking about what it is not. What is it about the place that it demands to be written about in such an equivocal way? I rebelled as a teen and so have often felt that I abandoned the old me and invented a new one, casting off the time and place I came from. But as I get older, I sense its presence inside me. I want to reconnect with the self I left behind. It’s partly that common impulse of curiosity – which informs a TV programme like Who Do You Think You Are? or a song like Where Do You Go to My Lovely. I want to look inside my head and remember where I came from. Because I can’t quite believe it was as lacking as my diary suggests.Like the negative of a photo, it’s as if the Technicolor version of life were happening elsewhere, full of events and successes, dreams and achievements. Meanwhile, whenever I tried to sum up the place where I lived and the life I was living, I would write over and over again: this didn’t happen, that didn’t happen. It’s neither one thing nor another, and I’m neither here nor there.1976. The diary continued, comfortingly routine and uneventful:20 February 1976 – “Went to St Albans and Hatfield. Got jeans in Dimple, £8.75, and a waistcoat in Tamla.’8 March – “Went to Brent Cross after school. It’s lovely!! All indoors. Got a shirt, scarf and a necklace.”This would have been my first trip there, as it had only just opened.27 March – “Went to a disco in New Barnet. Cost 35p. It was good. Went with Liz, and Deb and the mob.”In May 1976, my summer of disco began. I started going to the Brookmans Park hotel, where a disco took place every Saturday and Monday night. Punk was happening, but not yet for me, and not here, so instead we danced to soul records – For Once in My Life by Stevie Wonder, Get Up Offa That Thing by James Brown, Get Dancin’ by Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes, although the whole point of the night was the moment when the DJ slowed things down and the dance floor would empty, girls to one side, boys to another, and we’d wait, staring at the floor or resolutely over the shoulder of any boy who might seem to be approaching, until one would mutter, “Wanna dance?”, without ever making eye contact, and we’d head back out for a slow dance.Hands on his shoulders to keep him at arm’s length if I wasn’t sure, or clasped behind his neck if I was keener. And his hands would be on the back of my waist, or resting on my hips, or they’d slide down, and later I’d write “WHT” in my diary, for “wandering hand trouble”.The slow songs were always the same. If You Leave Me Now by Chicago, I’m Not in Love by 10cc, Without You by Nilsson, and my favourite, Misty Blue by Dorothy Moore. And I was only 13, but the boys were older, always older.24 July – “Creep asked me to dance again but I said no – found out he is called Tim and is a policeman! Yikes!!”I was 13, and he was a policeman. I keep thinking about what this means, and what it says about the time and the place. I picture myself, and I look like one of those girls in the Top of the Pops audiences, grinning at the camera, caught in the too-close embrace of an over-familiar DJ. I had shoulder-length hair, parted in the centre and with a fringe pushed back in wings that flicked out to either side of my forehead. I wore an A-line, knee-length denim skirt, with side pockets, and a wide, three-buttoned waistband, circled by a thin plastic belt. A peach-coloured T-shirt with a white collar. On my feet, a pair of denim sandals, rope soled, each foot bearing an applique butterfly. I was slim, but self-conscious I was trying hard, but felt plain. Did I look 13, or even 14? I suspect that, to the men and boys I met, I just looked like a bird. Fair game. All the same.18 September – “Went to disco. It was really good. Got off with Gary. Got home about 11.15.”19 September – “Saw Gary in his car, it’s a dark green Cortina with two yellow stripes down the side.”I put the registration number in my diary, too. I was nothing if not a stickler for detail. But the detail that screams at me now is the fact that he must have been at least 17. I’ve always complained bitterly about how strict my parents were, and yet that summer, they didn’t seem to have any idea what I was up to.In every other aspect of my life, I was a child. Aside from the disco, my hobbies were walking the dog, playing badminton and piano lessons. I had a paper round. Life was slow and even, and very little happened, over and over again. To pass the time, like everyone else I watched a lot of telly. Limited by three channels, we were bonded by watching and sharing the same few programmes, all of which I listed in my diary: Supersonic, Upstairs Downstairs, Crossroads, Candid Camera. I loved The Good Life, which, of course, was a satire about suburbia, although I could see that my parents weren’t much like the Goods – who were dungaree-wearing semi-hippies, unconventional and liberal – but were in fact more like Margo and Jerry: conservative, aspirational, repressed. And it wasn’t hard to see that they were the villains, while the Goods were the good guys. That worried me a bit.In September, my periods started, and I circled the day in black in my diary. Mum didn’t talk to me about periods, having described them to my sister Debbie a couple of years earlier, and presumably feeling that it was Debbie’s responsibility, being two years older than me, to pass the information on.Mum never explained sex to me either. So We lived in an atmosphere where sex was invisible and ever-present, girls were both ignorant and fair game and there were rules and no rules. I think of the 1970s, and I think of children playing grownup games.“Me and Deb got followed home by two cheeky fellas! Saw George and Mildred. Bed at 10.”In my 1970s commuter village, I never heard the word “class” used, and yet we all knew what it was, and everyone knew where they stood in the pecking order. Even for such a tiny place, there was a right and a wrong end of town. No one was truly posh because they hadn’t been there long enough, and if being upper class is a matter of history, ancestry and inheritance, – property that’s been passed down, land that has been owned for generations –then no one in Brookmans Park could claim that. There were bigger houses, but even the detached ones with gravel drives and wide gardens looked unmistakably suburban. If there was no upper class, there was no real working class either – there were no factories, no mines, no farms, no heavy industry. But this is not to say there was no hierarchy. Looking down on people was a favourite hobby, and the word used was “common”.My friend S’s mum dyed her hair bright yellow and wore a minidress with a chain belt, and she was common. Her husband had a grown-out duck’s-arse hairdo and wore chunky jewellery, and he was common, too. Swearing was common, too much makeup was common, sex was common. The word described vulgarity as much as class, and a terror of being infected by that vulgarity. When I left home, and met more worldly middle-class people, I realised that being called Tracey, and saying lounge and serviette and settee, meant that, whatever my mum thought, I may as well have had the word COMMON branded on my forehead. Throughout the 1980s, the names Sharon and Tracey were the ubiquitous markers of working-class womanhood. In their choice of my name, my parents had blundered horribly, any Sharons and Traceys being the chavs or Essex girls of their day. And yet what was I really? I wasn’t a chav, despite my name, and yet I felt different from people I met at university, who were posher, or urban, or rural. And it wasn’t easy to be defiant and proud about the difference. For I wasn’t working class. I was suburban a bit semi-detached. Almost a class of its own. Privileged in many ways, yes, but also sometimes scorned.Along with the dislike of vulgarity, went a distrust of what was called “showing off”. Particularly disagreeable in children, it was not welcomed in adults either, and included any kind of assertiveness, inidualism, eccentricity. What should be aimed for was anonymity, not drawing attention to yourself, in the hope that such quietness would be quietly acknowledged and rewarded. These were properly suburban values. Being in a band was probably showing off, I think now. Perhaps it’s no wonder that I always had trouble with summoning up the required self-confidence and assertiveness. Always in the back of my head was a voice telling me to stop showing off. Don’t make a spectacle. Put that drink down. Shhhh.But I wonder sometimes, what difference does it make growing up in an environment where you are not told to be quiet and stop showing off? Björk grew up on a commune, and said in an interview on a French fan website (bjork.fr): “I was the only child there… If I thought I had something to say, people would listen to me.” At the age of six she was studying piano and flute at school, and she released her first album aged 12. Did the commune liberate her as an artist, or was it in her anyway? Would she have been that person if she’d grown up in Surbiton?JG Ballard was famous for living in suburbia most of his life. He lived in a 1930s semi in Shepperton for decades, in a street filled with houses called Laurel View and Ivy Dene. But the continuing surprise of the rest of the world at his decision to remain in suburbia reveals how we can’t quite believe in it as an appropriate setting for anyone creative. We don’t like to admit to coming from suburbia. It’s a place you’re supposed to want to run away from. And yet it constantly gives birth to people who stretch and break these constraints.David Bowie may have been born in Brixton, but when he was seven his family moved to Bromley in Kent. From that suburban setting sprang his iconoclasm, his rule-breaking, perhaps proving that commonly held belief that growing up in a conservative environment is inspiring, giving the artistic type something to kick against, a reason to rebel. Following in Bowie’s footsteps in the mid-70s were a group of his fans who became known as the Bromley Contingent, and who are often thought of as the first true punks. Made up of characters like Siouxsie Sioux, Steve Severin, Billy Idol, Jordan, Soo Catwoman, Debbie Juvenile and Tracie O’Keefe, they were the ones who confronted Bill Grundy with the Sex Pistols on TV in 1976, and who were arrested after the famous Malcolm McLaren-organised boat trip down the Thames during the Queen’s silver jubilee celebrations. They were the ones who worked in Seditionaries, and whose pictures appeared in the press. I try to imagine them now, setting out for an evening in town, first having to leave their homes in those quiet, conventional streets. Did they get on the bus dressed like that? With their dramatic cat’s-eye makeup, hair sculpted into spikes and wings, wearing dog collars and fishnets, Siouxsie black-lipsticked and bare-breasted? It would have taken guts to walk around Soho looking like that, but Bromley? Picture it.By 1979, something was stirring in me, some inkling of how to escape this rut. The parent rows had started in earnest by now. My mum and I were standing on opposite sides of a canyon, shouting at each other, not hearing, not understanding. Was this conflict linked to my growing creative life? Did she and my dad sense something in me breaking away, turning my back on them? Youth culture, tribalism, music, creativity, all of this was more alarming to them than pubs, snogging older boys, or cars on country lanes. I told them I wanted to marry a poet and live in London. I wanted to get out. I couldn’t understand why they had ever moved here in the first place. Why would anyone want to? Who would choose suburbia? It’s for squares, for drones, worst of all, for PARENTS, who love it for the quality of life it offers. Young people don’t care about such things as comfort and cleanliness – they want culture, and nightlife, and energy. There are no clubs or pavement cafes in suburbia. You can’t explore it at night, as – say – Dickens walked the streets of London. Who walks around suburbia at night? You can’t be a suburban flâneur. Suburbia is for those who want a quiet life with no alarms or surprises. It goes to bed early, and after dark, when a teenager comes alive, the streets are silent.No wonder we looked at suburbia and wanted to burn it down.• Extracted from Another Planet: A Teenager in Suburbia by Tracey Thorn published by Canongate (£14.99).

It is not just that the views are stunning. Nor is it simply that the trains always run on time. It is also the absence of the noise pollution found when travelling by rail in the UK.There are no messages telling you the station is being monitored 24 hours by CCTV nobody telling you it is important for your own safety to stand back from the platform edge or that this is a no-smoking station. Above all, no “See it. Say it. Sorted” messages – a form of acoustic torture that is both constant and mindless. The way to make the railways safer is to do what they do in Switzerland: have a guard on every train.Even high up in the Alps it is still not possible to get away from these kind of mindless mantras because after a week spent at the World Economic Forum it is clear Davos does its own version of see it, say it, sorted.No question, the people who show up at the World Economic Forum see it. They see inequality is on the rise. They see it is no accident that weather-related incidents are happening a lot more frequently. They see another financial crisis is lurking out there somewhere. They see all that because you don’t have to be all that clever to see these things, and the people who turn up at Davos are not lacking in the brain cell department.Are they saying it? Yes, some of them are. For several years, Davos has resounded with warnings from important people about the need to take inequality seriously, to take action against global warming before it is too late, to put some serious curbs on the ability of the financial industry to blow up the world.This year was no exception. Davos started with an award to Sir David Attenborough for his contribution to environmentalism and ended with the 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg telling world leaders she wanted them to start panicking about global warming. By the time the WEF annual meeting came to an end, Thunberg was having an audience with Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Lagarde herself cited an Oxfam report showing that the 26 richest billionaires own the same amount of wealth as half the world’s population.Other big international organisations are saying it, too. Kristalina Georgieva, the acting head of the World Bank, said climate change was happening much faster than had previously been thought and had to be tackled urgently. “Put a picture of your children and your grandchildren in front of you,” she told the audience at the WEF’s closing session. “I guarantee it works.”The tumbling price of renewable energy and advances in battery storage means the old argument – that reducing carbon emissions is “bad” for the economy – is no longer heard, at least in public, at Davos. The new mantra is that restricting the increase in temperature to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would be a win-win – good for the planet and good for the economy.Even so, there remains a yawning reality gap between what is said and what is actually happening. Many countries, the US and Brazil, for example, are led by climate change sceptics. Companies that pollute do not themselves pay the cost of doing so. Using recycled materials is more costly for a firm than using up primary products. Poverty wages mean it is harder for consumers to shop sustainably even though they might want to.A serious attempt to reduce inequality would require stronger trade unions with the ability to negotiate higher wages for their members. It would require governments willing to be bolder in taxing the rich. The International Labour Organisation last week called for a universal labour guarantee to safeguard workers’ fundamental rights. There seems little real appetite for a new social contract among CEOs, despite the warm words.Nor will there be while economics is underpinned by the notion that more is always better, that the overriding goal of policy should be to maximise growth, and that interference in a system where power is skewed towards the rich and powerful should be kept to a minimum. The depressing conclusion from a dinner held in Davos to discuss new thinking in economics is that – with one or two notable exceptions – there has been very little new thinking in economics. A decade after the biggest crisis in living memory and with the clock ticking away on climate change, it’s business as usual.It took a trio of Yale psychology professors to point out where economics is going wrong: our brains are lying to us. The people who show up at Davos are at the pinnacle of a value system that insists more money equals greater happiness. But as Laurie Santos, one of the Yale academics, said, the things that actually make us happy: being with friends, doing things for others, enjoying our time off work, have very little to do with money. Money only seems to make billionaires happy when they are giving it away.The conclusions from this should be obvious. Economics in its traditional sense is useless when it comes to addressing the urgent problems that need to be solved. Other disciplines, such as psychology, can actually be more helpful than models based on supposedly rational consumers maximising their utility. And unless we rethink our economic model and retrain our brains, we can see it and we can shout it from mountain tops in Switzerland. But it won’t be sorted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb3d02a1e011ab37300685d63ca045815fd8c507/70_585_3641_2184/master/3641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c56f6203df2262ff9d10c5cc965c904","title":"britons do not grasp the eu essential motivation a quest for the quiet life","story":"We must learn to understand that the union is all about protecting the safety and prosperity of its citizensWhat does the EU want? This simple question has foxed Brits throughout the Brexit talks. It is alleged that Brussels is desperate to retain Britain that it yearns to get rid of it that German car-makers and friendly states such as the Netherlands will force Angela Merkel to let Britain cherrypick the best of membership that Europeans want to ruin Britain, sending it on its way with a punishment beating pour encourager les autres. None of this contradictory speculation has turned out to be right, and Britain’s negotiating efforts have been the poorer for it.European mainlanders can be hard to read. The Friday before last, prominent Germans including Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel’s heir presumptive, wrote a saccharine letter to the Times urging Britain to stay. On Monday the Polish foreign minister broke EU ranks to suggest that the Irish backstop be limited, to get Theresa May’s deal over the line. Yet on Wednesday Merkel seemingly contradicted her own colleagues, opining fatalistically that Britain, an island, had always had “patchy” relations with the EU and suggesting that its exit is inevitable. The day after, an exasperated Emmanuel Macron told a crowd near Lyon that Brexit has “torn British society apart” and “cannot be delivered”, his tone so critical that it moved a Spectator writer to ask why the French president “hates Britain so much”. The motivations and instincts of our continental partners sometimes baffle us Brits.To un-baffle ourselves, a useful principle is that most of what the EU and its leading members say or do can be traced back to the quest for the quiet life. Brexiters can forget their theories about Teutonic desires to rule the continent. Remainers can abandon their theories about Europe as a “peace project” per se. The reality is at once more prosaic and more poetic than either side allows: the European project knows no higher ideal than calm good living.That applies to the Brexit talks. The remaining 27 member states of the EU are fed up of the time- and energy-sapping annoyance and want it sorted, be that through the passing of May’s deal, a speedy British pivot to the “Norway” option or a decision to end Brexit altogether. In Brussels it is now wearily assumed that Britain will request an extension to the article 50 negotiating period. The officials’ nightmare is that this will drag on into the period of the new European parliament from July, which may require Britain to hold its own European election, or that Britain will withdraw article 50 only to trigger it again soon. “Stay or go, just make your minds up!” is a typical entreaty.Europe’s quest for the quiet life goes much further. The EU and most of its states were born or reborn from the rubble of war and the traumas of totalitarianism. Britons forget how deeply that affects their instincts. History is dense, present, complicated and inescapable on the mainland in a way that it is not in Britain. The pavements of German cities are studded with brass plaques bearing the names and dates of those deported to the death camps, planted outside the addresses where they once lived. Memories of flight, destruction and oppression – the 3am rap at the door, the rumble of military trucks on cobbles, the squelch of carts laden with possessions on muddy tracks – live on in continental families in a way that they do in comparatively few British ones.The opposite of horror and cataclysm is the quiet life. Voltaire wrote his novel Candide in 1759 after the catastrophic Lisbon earthquake and amid the destruction of the Seven Years’ War. The book preaches neither Panglossian optimism nor head-in-hands gloom, and rather the stoical satisfaction of a peaceful plot of land providing for its owners’ needs under the maxim: “We must cultivate our garden.” In the shadow of horror and cataclysm, the modest goal of a happily cultivated garden is the height of decency and civilisation. More than grand rhetoric about continental unity or geopolitics or European culture, this is the real objective of the EU – and what holds it together. It is also the thing that Brits most struggle to understand.The European Coal and Steel Community, the EU’s first precursor, was launched in 1952 to make the weapons-building parts of the French and German economies interdependent. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 was designed to make war between the two inconceivable. Having built peace, the next step was prosperity. The early European project underwrote the postwar boom, and with it welfare states promising material good living but also immaterial totems of the European lifestyle such as long holidays and universal healthcare.This European dream is glimpsed not in luxurious ceremonies in Paris, Brussels or Berlin but in well-heated social housing blocks in Utrecht or Vienna, in comfortable houses with gardens on the outskirts of Barcelona or Prague, in safe streets and decent hospitals. The eurozone crisis wreaked unnecessary and horrific misery on parts of southern Europe. But one can rightly fume about that and at the same time acknowledge that Europe still constitutes the largest concentration of prosperous, well-insured, long-living, safe and well-rested people in the world. Pity those Africans and Asians who would like to join in but are held back by Europe’s draconian immigration laws. The garden has high walls.The EU’s unofficial mission is to protect this comfortable, once-traumatised European garden from outside threats. When Helmut Kohl confronted sceptics in his Christian Democrat Union with the case for the euro, notes Alexander Clarkson of King’s College London, he did so primarily not with talk of peace but talk of preserving the European way of life. Today the EU is most effective when it shields its citizens from over-mighty technology firms, negotiates trade deals in a world where its population is proportionately smaller every year, and ventures tentative steps towards common defence forces independent from those of Donald Trump’s America. It lures its neighbours not with soaring rhetoric but with the promise of the quiet life for their citizens. Macedonia’s recent decision to change its name, ending a dispute with Greece and launching itself on the track to EU membership, was ultimately motivated by the desire to join the sheltered European garden.The obsession with the quiet life also explains the EU’s weaknesses. It concentrates too little on non-immediate security, demographic and industrial competitors outside its borders. It prioritises loss aversion above the uptake of opportunities. It generally values the stability of uniformity above the bracing fizz of difference. It is unremittingly defensive.Its Brexit talks with Britain have illustrated the best and worst of these traits. Shortly after the referendum, Merkel gathered German business leaders and her European counterparts to agree, in essence, that the risk of a fragmenting EU was the greatest danger to the European quiet life. The consensus she forged has held ever since. Its logic: a suburban tenant in Leipzig or Toulouse or Katowice, with his or her modest house and tidy garden, faces more risk from a collapse of the European project – in the nightmarish event that successive members attempt to replicate a successful Brexit or lose faith in the EU’s willingness to stand by member states like Ireland – than from the economic cost of a disorderly Brexit or the security cost of a Britain less militarily committed to the continent.A tour of European capitals illustrates this truth. The Dutch may sympathise with the Brits but their prime minister also uses Britain as a cautionary tale of a country whose citizens have lost their appetite for “a good life for themselves and those around them”. Poles may want to bend the rules of the Irish backstop to preserve the quiet life for their immigrant compatriots in Britain but only so far, for Warsaw knows the pain of European fragmentation better than most. Athens and Brussels dislike each other but remain committed to Greek membership of the EU because both fear a destabilising rupture. Macron may rail against Brexit but his real target is Marine Le Pen. Germans may be torn between seeking to stop Brexit by backing a second referendum and managing a messy British exit to get it over with but, like their fellow Europeans, their utmost concern is stability.Seen from Britain it is easy to spot what ides the EU and harder to identify what unites it, namely the quest for the quiet life on behalf of the citizens of a Europe tired of turmoil. Seen from the continent it is hard to understand the case for a wrenching British flounce or a daring British sally “out into the world” for trade with India and the like. If it wants to find common ground, London should pay less attention to the highfalutin European talk of prosperity, security and power and more to the EU’s underlying object. In other words: Brexit will succeed insofar as it serves the pursuit and preservation of the comfortable European garden.• Jeremy Cliffe is the Charlemagne columnist and Brussels bureau chief at the Economist "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/806878446c5217e29b31289b1b27240daa1a8078/0_77_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8ca7ba3c3c6a7ec59e947cc1fb3e29c","title":"demography not destiny politics polls brexit leave remain","story":"A study shows Britain is now majority Remain. But reliance on data is not a motor for changePeter Kellner’s “crossover day” has caused some commotion. Last Saturday, according to the veteran pollster, Britain became a majority Remain nation through demographic changes alone. Kellner’s calculations suggested that in the period since the 2016 referendum, sufficient old folk (who largely voted Leave) had died and enough teenagers, overwhelmingly Remain, had reached voting age to have wiped out the majority for Brexit.Remainers seized on Kellner’s projections as ammunition for a second referendum. Critics (not all Leave supporters) condemned them as being, in the words of the Labour MP Caroline Flint, “unhelpful, ageist and isive”. Whichever view one takes, the ruckus over “crossover day” reveals the way that political demography – the study of the relationship between population changes and political attitudes – has become increasingly central to public debate.Understanding demographic changes is undoubtedly important. An ageing population, changes in family sizes, shifts in the gender balance in the workplace – all have implications for policymaking and the allocation of resources.Demographic analyses of political attitudes can also provide valuable insights. The demographic breakdown of the Brexit vote or the changing role of class in voting patterns can help illuminate significant social trends. Demography has, however, come to be more than an aid to policymaking or political strategy. It has increasingly come to be seen as a causal attribute. There is, many suggest, a fundamental link between demographic traits and political attitudes. It’s a perspective that leads people to assume that which needs to be explained. We know, for instance, that those who voted Leave were likely to have been less educated than those who voted Remain. Many took this as evidence that Brexiters voted as they did because they were uneducated, hence ignorant. But as the political scientist David Runciman has observed, a better explanation may be that education is no longer simply a means to knowledge but has, rather, become a marker of one’s values and worldview. Simple demographic arguments can blind us to the complexities of social change while also entrenching prejudices.The obsession with demography has led to the fetishisation of certain groups and to the demonisation of others. The young are seen by many as the vanguard of liberalism and an open society. But while most young people are highly tolerant of ersity, many are also ambivalent about the merits of free speech and of democracy.The old are castigated for their illiberalism and narrow-mindedness. But the 65-plus cohort is also the generation that helped foment the 60s revolution that transformed attitudes to sexuality, ersity and equality. There is more here than a simple demographic cleavage between liberal youth and the illiberal elderly. What we are witnessing, rather, is likely to be a complex interplay of age, class and ethnicity against the background of a political system in turmoil.On the left, too, this approach is becoming more ingrained. It’s the left, though, that will most suffer in the reduction of politics to demography. We can see this in America in the raging debate within Democratic circles over whom the party should target in the 2020 presidential elections – white workers or minority groups. We can see it, too, in Labour’s Brexit prevarications instead of setting out a clear policy and aiming to win people to that stance, the Labour leadership seems to think it better to send different messages to different groups on either side of the Brexit ide and to make a virtue of evasion.In an age in which the politics of identity has become entrenched, demographic arguments inevitably have purchase. Ideals and values become seen not just as a terrain of political contestation but also as measures of tribal attachment.The significance of the “crossover day” argument was the claim that Britain had become Remain not because opinions had changed but because the electorate had. From one perspective, this was simply a statistical insight about a political swing arising out of demographic shifts. From another perspective, it entrenches the view that the motor of change is demography rather than politics. That’s a road we should all be wary of taking.The gilets jaunes protesters in France announced last week that they would be putting forward candidates in the forthcoming European elections. It’s a bold move, but one that could be destructive. There’s a big difference between a protest movement and a political party. A protest movement can be relatively inchoate, harnessing anger while embodying ergent viewpoints. A political party has to have a platform and a relatively coherent set of ideas. Where will the gilets jaunes candidates stand on immigration? Or taxation? Or equality?The movement has an anarchic set-up, in the main eschewing leaders. The protesters range from the far right to the far left, espousing both reactionary and progressive ideas. What unites them is a sense of anger and disillusionment, fury at their marginalisation and a hatred of the mainstream. In an age in which progressive social movements have largely crumbled, and in which there is widespread disenchantment with the very idea of collective social transformation, people’s political anger often finds expression not through opposition to a particular policy or government but through a generalised hatred of the system.Such anger can be the foundation for enabling progressive change. It can also be the battering ram for reaction. Kicking out against the system can all too easily mutate into indiscriminately striking out against the “other”. Hence the rise of reactionary groups throughout Europe, groups that direct popular anger not just towards economic policy or social inequality but also towards migrants or Muslims, the homeless or the poor.The key question is: who will give shape to disaffection? It’s a question that will now be posed in a sharper form to the gilets jaunes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f8727ef5d2c561b70b907935d3ae98560b1acc5/0_69_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6a65527e236fa4726f140075a50d4f2","title":"kamala harris black women progressives support record","story":"Like many people of color, Harris’s previous record gives me pause – she has supported policies that have contributed to a broken criminal justice system On 21 January, California senator Kamala Harris officially announced her run for the presidency. Since being first elected to office over 14 years ago, Harris has proven she’s a force to be reckoned with. Now with her bid to become president, she has been catapulted to the very fore of US politics.For me and many other black women, the presidential candidacy of a fellow black woman is more than exciting. But, only days after Harris’s announcement, I have already faced the assumption and even expectation – by people within and beyond my community – that I will automatically vote for her. No one, however, should take black women’s support for Harris for granted.Like many people of color and progressives, Harris’s previous record gives me serious pause. Any candidate for office who has been a prosecutor in a racially biased criminal justice system must account for the ways in which she minimized that system’s harm or perpetuated its failures. At various points throughout her career, Harris has supported policies that have contributed to a broken criminal justice system that harms people of color at disproportionate and alarming rates.As California’s attorney general, Harris blocked the release of non-violent offenders on the premise that they may lower the prison labor pool and threatened to enforce a one-year prison sentence for parents whose children were truant. Policies like these disproportionately harm low-income families. Truancy policies that impose jail sentences are often coupled with court fees of $300 an unexcused absence.The court fees, (and possible loss of employment due to incarceration) could prove dire for families already living below the poverty line. Equally important, there is no empirical evidence that incarcerating parents for truancy is an effective strategy for increasing school attendance. There is however, evidence that while truancy is an issue faced in many schools in America, families most affected by harsh enforcements are those with low incomes and families of color.Furthermore, the abuse of power and other forms of prosecutorial misconduct is a glaring problem in the criminal justice system. Yet Harris defended a Kern county prosecutor who committed “outrageous government misconduct” by reportedly falsifying the confession of a defendant who was “later used to threaten a life sentence”.These are not facts that can be ignored, despite the enthusiasm around Harris, and even an innate impulse I feel to protect her. Black female candidates are poorly represented in our politics. I am worried about the inevitable sexist and racist attacks Harris will probably endure during this campaign. Simply existing as a black woman ensures that Harris is constantly under siege. America is both painfully unforgiving of our mistakes and fully committed to profiting from our success. It is a challenging intersection to navigate, and even the slightest mistake can prove fatal.Still: black women, people of color and progressives supporting Harris need to ask tough questions about this record. This may feel like unnecessary scrutiny of an already vulnerable candidate. Yet, supporting her without at least inquiring about her decisions as a prosecutor would be tantamount to pledging our allegiance to symbolism. As many Democratic candidates have proven to us in the past, when the price of our loyalty is that low, we get very little in return. And despite thinly veiled assumptions that black people are politically apathetic, our collective voting power is undeniable.The power of black people’s organizing, voices and votes have delivered historical elections for this country. We have used strategic grassroots organizing and voting to turn red states blue, as we did by unseating the Republican incumbent Ray Moore in Alabama. The brilliant campaign ran by Stacey Abrams was another example of the ways in which we can shake the table and serve as the impetus for political progress.This power is recognized by politicians, but recognition is no longer enough. Relying on our vote without earning it and developing a strong plan to address systemic inequality is no longer enough.Black women and people of color cannot afford to equate seeking accountability and strong policies with disloyalty. In fact, loyalty to our community requires us to demand the most from candidates seeking the highest office in the country. It is our duty to help them reckon with the ways they may have harmed us in the past. And it is our responsibility to demand a clear plan on how they will fight for us in the future. We deserve nothing less.Despite obvious concerns, I remain hopeful about Harris. But more importantly, I am committed to helping ensure my community is no longer courted during election season and disregarded once the votes are cast. And that means challenging candidates I might otherwise want to protect – including Kamala Harris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b209a342be52ec29d42f88fabd12c0aec973718/0_98_2461_1477/master/2461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83c602511703cf2f22468f37b6f3912b","title":"more means less when it comes to a great cafe patisserie valerie","story":"Patisserie Valerie lost its atmosphere when it became just another chain restaurant with a vague ‘Belgian patisserie’ themeThe first time I went to Patisserie Valerie, in December 1993, it felt really special. I was having a day out in London during the Christmas vacation after my first term at university and a college friend, who lived in London, took me to what I for many years wrongly thought of as the original Knightsbridge branch. It seemed extremely refined and continental – the cakes were like the ones that, in those days, you only really got in France. Lots of millefeuilles, no iced buns. To an undergraduate rube, it was a glimpse into the hidden London where only very posh people go.I don’t know how many branches of Patisserie Valerie there were in 1993. But it was obviously more than the one Old Compton Street outlet that Enzo, Robert and Victor Scalzo bought in 1987 from descendants of the original Madame Valerie, and fewer than the nine that existed when they sold the firm to venture capitalists in 2006. When it went into administration last week, there were about 200.Early last year, I went to one of them. It was in the Brunswick Centre near Russell Square, in London, next to an arthouse cinema. This time, it didn’t feel very special. It was fine, but it was pretty empty. I had a sandwich and a tea while someone swept the floor. But, unlike in 1993, it obviously wasn’t a genuine Belgian patisserie that had been running for the best part of a century. It was just a chain restaurant that had randomly taken “Belgian patisserie” as its vague theme. It could turn into a GBK or a Harry Ramsden’s or a Café Rouge or a Pret or an Eat or a Giraffe at the click of a financier’s mouse.It feels so weird and arbitrary. I get no sense that the reason Patisserie Valerie leapt from a handful of branches to hundreds was because of public demand. I suppose there’s a demand for cafes in general, but I don’t think many people were saying: “You know the distinctive feel of that cake shop in Old Compton Street? If only that was available literally everywhere!” I don’t think people outside London had particularly heard of it – it wasn’t like Hamley’s or Fortnum \u0026amp Mason. They were just suddenly presented with it. “That Zizzi’s turned into something called Patisserie Valerie.” “Oh. Do they still do cappuccinos?” “I suppose so.”And it doesn’t make sense even if there did turn out to be a vast unexploited market for the very specific Belgian-metropolitan ambience I enjoyed in 1993, because a chain of Patisserie Valerie’s scale and nature is incapable of replicating that sort of atmosphere – as I discovered at the Brunswick Centre. It’s not like McDonald’s, which, whether or not you like it, you have to admit is pretty much the same everywhere. In this case, the original successful thing is too ephemeral to be recaptured by a team of local staff taken on when the TGI Friday’s closed.I’m not saying this is why the chain failed. The current crisis was precipitated by the discovery last October of “significant, potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities”, which meant there was a £40m gap in its accounts. Until then, everything looked rosy, with Patisserie Holdings, the parent company, valued at over half a billion pounds in June. But it’s hard to believe that wasn’t a huge overestimation of its worth, and that there isn’t a fundamental weakness in the business motivating all the alleged books-cooking.I first properly noticed the weird way the restaurant business currently operates when the Ask Pizza near me changed overnight into something called Franco Manca. It still seemed to be a restaurant but I had no idea what sort. I initially assumed it was something vaguely Spanish, which was stupid of me as that would be like a Viennese restaurant calling itself Hitler Mitlo.My confusion wasn’t eased when I discovered that Franco Manca, like Ask Pizza before it, is a pizza restaurant – the main difference being that Franco Manca serves sourdough pizza while Ask served what I think a gastronome would describe as normal pizza. So why the change? Was Ask doing badly? If so, what made someone think its problems would be solved by making the dough more sour?Just like when going mad, having seen one inexplicable thing, I started seeing them everywhere. That’s how it was with Franco Mancas. So, out of curiosity, on one of the occasions when I would otherwise have gone to Pizza Express, I went to a Franco Manca. I thought it was fine, but no better than Pizza Express.Is that sort of one-off curiosity visit enough to sustain such a chain? It’s almost like going to see a film because you’ve noticed so many posters for it – but, instead of posters, you’ve seen actual branches of the restaurant on every high street. So, if you’ve got time on your hands, maybe you pop in. If you don’t, you miss the release – personally, I never got round to Prezzo or Chimichanga and lots of them have closed now. Maybe they’ll bring out a DVD.Obviously if, having popped in, you find this new chain restaurant to be really terrific, and better than the chain restaurants you’ve previously frequented, then this all makes sense. But how often does that happen? Not very often, judging by the parlous financial state of the sector. Poor old Jamie Oliver seems to be constantly cranking out books and TV shows purely to pay the staff wages in all the deserted branches of Jamie’s Italian. And every other chain, from Carluccio’s to Byron, seems to be feverishly closing branches or renegotiating rents.I’m no businessman, which will become obvious when I say that, to me, all this feels like a huge waste of time and energy: this desperation to take any half-decent food service concept and then strain every financial sinew to immediately open versions of it in every town, city and shopping centre, only for the resultant frail, over-stretched company to collapse in the face of the lightest breeze of consumer parsimony. What’s the point? Patisserie Valerie was a small good thing and now it’s bloated and broken, a dispiriting echo of the effect of too much cake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9110b2195e07b2d7ec7ad001ff008883371fb405/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6593e1b8f28448e7281f9f9fa77d97f6","title":"no pity for corrupt maduro who has broken his country democracy must have its day","story":"He is clinging to power. Only removing him will pull Venezuela back from the brinkVenezuela, Nicolás Maduro’s dwindling band of foreign supporters like to claim, is a theatre in a new cold war. Donald Trump’s administration and his hawkish foreign policy advisers, with their occasional threats of military intervention, provide the perfect props. So does Jair Bolsonaro, the new far-right president in Brazil. But the real contest in Venezuela is between democracy and dictatorship. Maduro leads a corrupt authoritarian regime that has stolen and broken a once-prosperous country, staging a coup against its own constitution.On Saturday 12 January, a power cut at the University Hospital in Caracas caused the deaths of six patients, according to a union representative. It was not an isolated incident: in the two months from mid-November, 40 hospitals in Venezuela monitored by a local doctors group suffered power cuts lasting an average of three hours a day. But the deaths at the University Hospital were a particular embarrassment to Maduro, Venezuela’s ruler since 2013. Highlighting his country’s descent into criminal public mismanagement, they happened just after he was inaugurated for a second six-year term as president, in a sparsely attended ceremony at the supreme court and not the national assembly, as the constitution requires.For most governments in the Americas, for the European Union and for many Venezuelan people, that ceremony was bogus. For them, Maduro is no longer a legitimate president, but simply a dictator who staged his re-election last year in a fraudulent poll from which the main opposition parties were barred. Over the past fortnight, Venezuela has seen nationwide protests, including in poor neighbourhoods traditionally loyal to Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s predecessor and mentor.They culminated in massive marches last Wednesday, during which Juan Guaidó, the new, young speaker of the opposition-controlled national assembly, proclaimed himself to be the country’s interim president. In a co-ordinated move, the United States and a dozen other countries in the Americas recognised Guaidó. For several hours, power seemed to hang in the balance. Then senior military commanders reaffirmed their support for Maduro and rejected what they claimed was a “coup”. Guaidó has gone into hiding.The date of last week’s marches, 23 January, is significant in Venezuela. On that day in 1958, a popular uprising overthrew a military dictatorship, ushering in a stable two-party democracy. Fuelled by oil exports, Venezuela became the wealthiest country in South America and a haven for political exiles from military dictatorships elsewhere on the continent in the 1970s. Then the oil price collapsed and popular discontent at austerity and corruption saw the election in 1998 of Chávez, a charismatic army officer who had led a failed coup.Chávez had the good fortune to preside over the biggest oil boom in the country’s history. He is still revered by half the population, who recall his social programmes and popular touch. But by the time he died of cancer in 2013 he had bankrupted his country, running up debt and strangling the private sector with controls while replacing its output with imports. He replaced a flawed social democracy with a clientelist society, in which benefits and food rations are handed out in return for political loyalty. The state has been hollowed out into corrupt fiefs, controlled by armed groups, legal or not. In an emblematic case, Chávez’s former treasurer admitted in a New York court to taking $1bn in bribes, a sum greater than all the bribes paid by Odebrecht, Brazil’s notoriously corrupt construction company.Venezuela is suffering one of the worst peacetime economic collapses, akin only to that of Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe. The economy has shrunk by almost half since 2014, while hyperinflation destroys the value of wages. This collapse is not the result of low oil prices, still less of sanctions imposed by the US (which mainly affect inidual leaders of the regime). Other oil producers have weathered lower prices, but in Venezuela the regime’s mismanagement has seen oil output fall by almost two-thirds since Chávez took office.Cuba’s leadership could at least point to past achievements, to world-class health, education and hurricane-defence programmes. In return for cheap oil, Cuba is propping up a feral regime that rules a country in which the vast majority have fallen into poverty and child mortality is rising sharply. As South American countries suddenly face absorbing 3 million Venezuelan immigrants, Maduro’s regime has become a regional problem. In Caracas, the military offers Maduro the loyalty of a partner in crime. The generals fear that Guaidó’s offer of an amnesty for the billions they have stolen will not be honoured. Maduro will no doubt try to limp on through further repression, but he may run out of money. The US is unlikely to attempt a military invasion but it is looking at ways to channel payment to Guaidó and the assembly for the oil it still imports.A swift negotiation in which Maduro departs and a free election is called is the best hope for Venezuela. This route has been offered to Maduro before and he has rejected it. Things may get worse for Venezuelans before they get a chance to recover their country.Michael Reid is the author of Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America.

Is its creator a genius or a monster?I first heard about Dau five years ago, and have been figuratively banging on the door ever since, to no avail. Two weeks ago, the door opened – literally. I am invited to a mansion block on London’s Piccadilly where, behind an anonymous black door, lies another world. The lobby is dimly, atmospherically lit – a room out of a David Lynch movie. A man in a 1940s-style suit and hat stands pulling back the curtain and peeking on to the street – except he turns out to be a mannequin. A bald security guard with a Russian accent takes my signature and photograph. Photography and recording are forbidden. A friendly American woman guides me through labyrinthine corridors painted black and red and grey, the walls plastered with Soviet-era posters and photos. There are more mannequins in vintage costumes in startling places: hanging from a chandelier, kneeling and kissing a Soviet flag. There is a large mannequin workshop. There are modern editing suites behind frosted glass walls. There is a restaurant serving Georgian cuisine, and a function room in 1940s-style decor. The sound of a dog barking carries down the corridor. “That’s a real dog, by the way,” my guide says. You can’t be too sure.I am here to watch some films. Dau is a film project, or at least, it began as one. Now, nobody knows how to describe it. It has been called a “Stalinist Truman Show”, a serious anthropological experiment, even a “Soviet Love Island”. In scale, it has been compared to infamous movie shoots that spiralled out of control, such as Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now. But Dau also has echoes of the Stanford prison experiment – in which students lost sight of the fact that they were playing a role, acting as guards and prisoners rather too enthusiastically. Stanford’s experiment had to be shut down after six days Dau’s continued for three years.Dau began in 2005 as a conventional biopic of a real-life Russian scientist named Lev Landau. Landau worked with pioneering quantum physicists such as Niels Bohr, had a hand in the Soviet atomic weapons programme, and won a Nobel prize in 1962. He took an experimental approach to sex and drugs as well as science, living by his belief that marriage should be no impediment to sexual freedom (his wife, Kora, was less enthusiastic). The film’s director was Ilya Khrzhanovsky, a then 29-year-old Russian with just one previous work to his name – a challenging, hallucinatory drama titled 4, which had won considerable acclaim. The Greek-born conductor Teodor Currentzis was cast as the lead, simply named Dau. Non-actors made up the majority of the huge cast – 400 principal actors and 10,000 extras.The central location of Dau was a Soviet research institute, inspired by the secret facility in which Landau lived and worked from the late 30s until his death in 1968. About a year into shooting, in 2009, a gigantic set, the size of two football pitches, was constructed at an abandoned swimming baths in Kharkiv, north-east Ukraine. But when it was completed, Khrzhanovsky abandoned the idea of finishing the film to focus exclusively on his replica institute, now also known as Dau.It became less a film set than a parallel world: a functioning mini-state, stuck in the mid-20th century and sealed off from the modern world. Dau was populated with hundreds of extras, or “participants”, who lived as faithfully as possible as Soviet citizens. The period authenticity was obsessive, covering clothes (even down to the underwear), hairstyles, food packaging, cigarette brands. What is more, time moved forwards inside Dau, from 1938 to 1968, so all the period detail was continually updated. Participants were paid in Russian roubles, which could be spent on set. (Some of the older extras, playing caretakers, smuggled in their own roubles saved from the Soviet era and tried to spend them they were reprimanded for using “fake” money.)Dau’s cast of non-actors was drawn from a nationwide database of auditionees compiled by the producers. The number of videotaped auditions fluctuates between 210,000 and 392,000, depending on who you ask many of Dau’s “official” statistics are all but unverifiable. Roles were played by people who had played those roles for real: cleaners, waitresses, academics, party officials, shamans, artists even, sometimes, criminals and real-life neo-Nazis, the latter of whom brought the project to a close by helping to destroy the set in “1968”. Scientists who visited or took up temporary residency there included Nobel-prize-winning physicist David Gross, neuroscientist James Fallon, and Harvard maths professor Shing-Tung Yau. The artists included Marina Abramović, Carsten Höller and theatre director Peter Sellars.The weirdest thing was, hardly any of this was actually filmed. This was not a giant Big Brother house there were no hidden cameras. A single cinematographer – German veteran Jürgen Jürges – roamed the set with a three-person crew. Between 2009 and 2011, he filmed 700 hours of footage – only a fraction of the duration of the “experiment”. The rest of the time, people apparently went about their Soviet business, unobserved.The Scottish producer Eddie Dick got a taste of Dau in 2011, when he went to Ukraine to discuss a potential collaboration between Khrzhanovsky and director Nicolas Roeg. The induction process was meticulous, he tells me. He and his colleague were given a crib sheet of facts about 1953 – the current year inside Dau. They were dressed in period costume Dick’s hair was cut new spectacles with more period-appropriate frames were quickly ordered from a local optician. They were given “passports” and some (real) roubles. On the threshold of the set, their papers were checked by guards and they were interrogated about the purpose of their visit.“I wasn’t sure if everybody started doing things when we appeared, but certainly everybody was doing what they were supposed to be doing,” Dick says. Armed guards were marching up and down. People were eating in the cafe three or four scientists were conducting experiments in the laboratory with electromagnetic guns. The journalists were preparing the newspaper of the day. The architects were poring over a plan of a Kharkiv of the future – as in, the 1960s. He even visited Dau’s apartment and met his wife, Nora, played by the Russian actor Radmila Shchyogoleva. “A tiny babushka opened the door. Nora floated downstairs in an elegant dress and had tea with us for half an hour. She was in character the whole time. The illusion was kept up by everyone and everything,” Dick says. “We never broke the rules, either. I never turned to anyone and said, ‘Come on. What the fuck’s going on here?’ You found yourself mesmerised by the facade, and we just went along with it.” But throughout Dick’s visit, he saw no filming taking place.Some people allegedly moved to Ukraine and lived at Dau for months, even years, eating, working and sleeping on the set. Others came and went quickly, convinced that this recreation of a totalitarian state had morphed into something genuinely oppressive and dark. Rumours began to circulate that Khrzhanovsky was as interested in sex and power as he was in art. Rather than Coppola’s shoot of Apocalypse Now, Dau began to sound like the heart of darkness itself: an entire world cut off from civilisation, living by its own rules, with Khrzhanovsky as its Colonel Kurtz figure, a film-maker gone rogue.The reason Dau’s door opened to me is that, nearly 15 years after its inception, the project is finally ready to show to the public. Three immersive exhibitions are planned for this year, in Paris, London, then Berlin. Before the opening, I am promised an interview with Khrzhanovsky in Paris. First, though, I am required to watch at least four of the 13 feature films that have been edited from 700 hours of footage from the institute. (More is planned: a TV series, documentaries, and, at some point, a cinema release for the original Dau movie.)The first three films I am shown are a trilogy centring on Nora. The films are in Russian with no subtitles, but through an earpiece a monotone voice narrates the English translation. In the first, Nora’s mother comes to visit her at the institute – which looks less like a genuine Soviet facility than a postmodern fantasia based on one. In the second film, Dau (Currentzis) is visited by his former lover, a beautiful Greek woman named Maria. Nora is away, but then returns unexpectedly.The third film, set more than a decade later, is more startling. Dau has considerably aged and is almost bedridden (the real Lev Landau had a debilitating car accident in 1962 he died in 1968). His son Denis has grown up into an eccentric man-child. Nora is bored and lonely. There is incest, and prolonged scenes of graphic, unsimulated sex. In the fourth film, the institute’s caretakers get drunk on vodka. An old lady vomits copiously. Then, for the bulk of the film, two men, Sasha and Valera, embark on a night of drunken passion that swings between tenderness, clumsy sex and physical and verbal abuse.The films are both exhilarating and boring. There are long, rambling dialogue scenes with very few cuts (Jürges shoots with a single camera). But there is an authentic emotional rawness and intensity to the drama. The experience is closer to watching a documentary, or perhaps a Danish Dogme film, like Lars von Trier’s The Idiots.The true scale of the project becomes apparent when I am shown a 10-minute trailer for the original, still unfinished Dau movie, which looks appetisingly epic: vast crowds, 1930s street scenes, a huge replica Soviet propeller plane. There are countless striking images: a masked ball, a church bell crashing to the ground, piles of rotten cabbages, women smashing up clay rabbits on a production line.I am also shown the digital component of the project. In Paris, visitors will be able to explore hours of footage from within custom-built booths, like confession boxes. My screen is ided into a grid of 16 sub-screens, each playing a random scene, like a bank of surveillance cameras. Click on one and it becomes full-screen. Supplementary information is available on each character in any scene: biographies, photo galleries, documentation such as passports and letters.Scanning this brings up a bewildering panoply of images: Abramović (in 50s costume) undergoing a purification ritual by a shaman Fallon discussing capitalism at a dinner party Dau standing over a naked man and woman having sex (there is always at least one screen playing sexual content). An official abusing a tearful, naked woman in a prison cell shockingly, he forces her to drink cognac, then to put the bottle in her vagina. Nothing looks simulated.I recognise people from the movies I have seen: a bearded scientist who insulted Dau’s son as “clinically retarded” is now discussing a recent ayahuasca experiment. Elsewhere, one of the waitresses from the institute’s cafe is standing on a table with two men in their underpants at a party. They all begin throwing knives at an abstract painting. “That’s what I call contemporary art!” one of them exclaims. “Now we can put this up in a gallery.”Others are more sceptical. “I’m convinced the reason the project has been active for so long has nothing to do with creative reasons, but that it allows Khrzhanovsky to live a luxurious and tyrannical lifestyle, lording it over dozens, if not hundreds, of people on a Russian oligarch’s dime,” says one critic, who asked not to be named.The “oligarch” is no secret: he is a Russian entrepreneur named Sergei Adoniev, who became a Bulgarian citizen in 2008. One estimate puts his wealth at $800m, mostly made in the Russian telecommunications business. He also funds Russia’s opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, and largely devotes his time and wealth to cultural and philanthropic causes. But this week Bulgaria rescinded Adoniev’s citizenship a ministry of justice spokeswoman said this followed notification that he “had been convicted in the United States 20 years ago on fraud charges”.When I visit Paris ahead of the launch, I meet Martine d’Anglejan-Chatillon, who Khrzhanovsky “cast” in the role of Dau’s executive producer” in 2016. Dau is “the antithesis of culture as entertainment,” she explains, “of having this nice, comfortable thing that you already know what it is before you go.” Visitors to Dau in Paris will not be able to fully control their own experience, she says. You do not buy a ticket you are granted a “visa”. You can choose your length of stay – six hours, 24 hours or unlimited – and you must fill out a psychometric questionnaire online, the responses to which generate your own bespoke itinerary. Assuming your application is successful, you are required to trade your mobile phone for a device that directs you to various sites across the two venues. It could be a 400-seat auditorium or a fourth-level basement. I tour back-of-house spaces decorated in Dau’s now-familiar SovietLynchian aesthetic: dimly lit corridors, Soviet paraphernalia, more mannequins. One room is a 1940s Russian parlour another is filled with the contents of a Berlin sex shop.Your device might send you to a film screening, then to a talk or a performance by a visiting artist such as Currentzis, Brian Eno, Massive Attack’s Robert del Naja, or theatre director Romeo Castellucci. You might be prescribed some viewing on the Dau digital platform. And finally, you will be directed to a one-to-one session in a booth with an “active listener”, who could be a real-life priest or a rabbi or a psychologist.Were there aspects of the project that made D’Anglejan-Chatillon uncomfortable, I ask. “Of course. One projects. In the ambiguities that Ilya creates, we project our fears, our anxieties, our egos. I think that’s part of the work: it activates whatever part of you is a little bit damaged or heightened.”She puts the question back to me. I mention the scene with the actor playing a prison guard abusing the naked woman. It is a scene from one of the 13 features, she explains, focusing on the woman, who is by no means disempowered throughout. And it is, after all, acting, she reminds me. “She knows she can stop. Everyone would stop if she said, ‘I can’t handle this.’ But she has chosen to put herself almost through this… almost this fire. Probably to find something else on the other side.” Without speaking to the woman herself, it is hard to verify this.The casting sheds some light on how Dau’s realism was achieved. Dau’s man-child son is played by Nikolay Voronov, who turns out to be a Ukrainian YouTube star. Sasha and Valera, the two gay lovers, were formerly homeless people, someone tells me, and, “They do that every night.” Nora’s mother is played by Radmila Shchyogoleva’s real-life mother, Lidiya.I speak to Dau’s star, Teodor Currentzis, over the phone. “The point is how to be yourself and not to be yourself at the same moment,” he says. He is now back at his day job, as artistic director of Russia’s Perm State Opera and Ballet Theatre. “You are in an environment that you know is a game, but it doesn’t work if you are not yourself,” he explains. Currentzis was invited by Khrzhanovsky to play the role of Dau after meeting him socially in Moscow, in 2005.He spent about a year shooting the film, then two years within the “institute”, on and off. He lived, slept and ate there, 24 hours a day, for days and weeks at a time. There was no nipping out to check emails. And when he and others did leave the institute, “sometimes we would notice after a while that we hadn’t changed our clothes. We were sleeping and waking up and working in the clothes we had worn inside. When we were out, it was like visiting another time. The real world was like a set to us.” According to Currentzis, many people lived at Dau for the duration of the experiment. “I know people who, if they had to decide whether to stay there or to return to ‘the future’, they would stay.”Within the institute, Currentzis had some freedom to do whatever he liked, but situations were also imposed on him. Somebody would knock at the door of his apartment, for example, or Nora’s mother would arrive. Sometimes he discussed events with Khrzhanovsky sometimes Khrzhanovsky would not speak to him at all.The experience was no holiday. “I had absolute freedom inside, but if the ‘KGB’ grabbed me, they could send me to jail. They could behave really badly to you. I felt very uncomfortable many times, but it’s the same discomfort I feel in my own life. If we want to make something that is real, it has to be like real life.”Other people I spoke to were less comfortable with Khrzhanovsky’s project. Many former Dau associates were reluctant to speak to me at all. Eddie Dick found Khrzhanovsky to be worryingly megalomaniacal and surprisingly limited in his film knowledge he had not heard of Nicolas Roeg or seen any of his work. “His overweening arrogance was breathtaking at times. All his staff were treated like servants and everybody treated him like a prince. If he said it was raining outside, it was definitely raining.” Dick helped Khrzhanovsky obtain a work permit for the UK, but when they met again in Edinburgh, Khrzhanovsky became increasingly indifferent to the proposed collaboration. “We had a falling out. Quite a deep falling out.”Questions were raised in 2011 by writer Michael Idov, who visited the Dau set and wrote about it for GQ magazine. He claimed a procession of young women were being offered “assistant” positions by Khrzhanovsky. One auditionee spoke of being questioned by him about her sex life and her willingness to perform sexual acts. When she refused, she was swiftly sent home. Further allegations surfaced this week in French newspaper Le Monde: that some of the neo-Nazi extras, led by Maxim Martsinkevich (currently serving a sentence in a penal colony for assault) repeatedly physically attacked an American artist named Andrew Ondrejcak, who was playing a psychologist on the Dau set. Ondrejcak said he was too traumatised to comment, Le Monde reported. When the Dau project began, the myth of the wild, inspired, genius-level male artist was still intact 15 years later it emerges in a changed landscape. If the allegations about Khrzhanovsky’s project were true, the #MeToo movement and exposés of Hollywood abusers such as Harvey Weinstein would cast them in a very different light. (There is no suggestion that any of the public figures involved in the project had any knowledge of these allegations.)I am finally granted my audience with Khrzhanovsky, late in the evening in Paris – and he is strenuous in his denials. We meet in Dau’s pop-up Georgian restaurant, just across the street from the Théâtre du Châtelet. He is youthful-looking, with glasses, a round face and a mop of curly black hair, shaved at the sides – a style that reminds me of Kim Jong-Un. But Khrzhanovsky is not at all despotic-seeming: he is engaged and engaging, casual and conversational. Over coffee, then whisky, and many cigarettes, in slightly broken English, he talks at length about science, art, acting, politics, and the Soviet Union.Lev Landau had a scientific formula for happiness, he tells me. It had four basic elements: love, work, friendship, freedom. “What is freedom? What is happiness? That was the initial thing I was interested in.” That and the nature of genius: “Genius people are, for me, like kind of ancient heroes. They got a gift from the gods.” That was why he cast a conductor as Dau, he explains Currentzis has the quality of genius, which no actor can portray.Does Khrzhanovsky, now 43, consider himself a genius?An only child, Khrzhanovsky grew up in Moscow surrounded by artists and intellectuals. His father, Andrey, is a renowned film-maker, whose 1968 film The Glass Harmonica became the first animated movie to be banned in the USSR. His godfather was a screenwriter named Sergei Yermolinsky, who corresponded with Tolstoy as a child and was best friends with the writer Mikhail Bulgakov. They were culturally, if not financially, privileged, he acknowledges. The Soviet Union broke up when he was 15, but Khrzhanovsky still considers himself a “Soviet person”, he says. “When I come to the United Kingdom, at border control, where the form asks, ‘Where were you born?’ I write ‘USSR’.”Dau was less about recreating Soviet conditions than examining the present day, he explains. “If something’s a fairytale, if it’s fantasy or historical, then we’re, in a way, relaxed because it’s not about us.” Soviet citizens, and Dau’s participants, submitted to totalitarian rule with eyes open today we seem to be oblivious to it, he suggests. “The system that controls us today is the cellphone. We say, ‘Oh great, I bought the new iPhone,’ or whatever. You bought something that controls you more.” He picks up his own phone from the table. “What does this thing know about us? More than we know about ourselves. We live in a transparent world, but we cannot accept it. In the same way that we cannot accept that we are on a planet moving through space when we’re sitting here.”But the retro setting was also a device to liberate human behaviour, it seems. “Because it’s not real, things happen more quickly, and they’re less risky, in a way. That’s why you can end up in a situation where you are very emotional. In normal life you would be afraid to go that far because the cost is too high.”He says he was never on set “directing” the action, but that he would talk to performers on the outside, or initiate events by bringing new people in. “I control only the rules. If the rules were wrong, I could change the rules. But I could not break the rules,” he says.Doesn’t this suggest he was as much a dictator as a director?He rejects this idea, saying that a lot of behaviour could be described as dictatorial. “You can be a dictator in your family,” he replies. “You can be a dictator in your company. You can be a dictator in your own life and destroy it.” He rejects the idea that he manipulated his actors into extreme behaviour, though. For one thing, there was no secret filming, he points out. “The people I invited were not the type who would go on a reality show. You need to respect them. And if you respect them, then they can go very far with you.”Khrzhanovsky also denies he abused his power for sexual gratification. I ask if he ever questioned interviewees or auditionees about their sex lives, as alleged. “This I never do when I am interviewing for the art department or the administrative positions. But for casting, I discuss childhood, parents, emotional things, love, sex, friendship, death… this is important, because we don’t work with actors but with real people. You talk to them about life, not acting methods.” Does he have any regrets about his treatment of women? “No. For me it makes no difference if it’s a woman or man, if you’re talking about work. Obviously there is an emotional difference between people and this is part of the beauty – but it is not determined by gender.”“There are a lot of rumours around my project,” he continues. “Then the rumours start to look like truth, then they become the truth. But it’s not the truth.” Does being Russian, and having a wealthy patron, not help? He agrees, explaining that a mutual friend introduced him to Adoniev, after the oligarch said he liked Khrzhanovsky’s film 4. But he has been the perfect patron, he says, giving the director plenty of money (he puts the figure at €25m) and left him well alone. “From the moment we met to the moment shooting finished, five years, I saw him maybe five times.” Khrzhanovsky insists that he does not have an unlimited budget. “I remember in one of our conversations he said, ‘You know, Ilya, probably you think I’m more rich than I am.’”Dau’s extravagance might seem outlandish, but its budget is probably lower than that of a typical Hollywood movie. Costs in Ukraine are low, and the crew was relatively small. Added to which, Khrzhanovsky points out, he has made 13 films out of it so far, with more to come. How much more depends on what happens when the public finally gets a chance to engage with Dau. It is time to see if Khrzhanovsky’s self-professed intuition was correct.Where can Khrzhanovsky can go next, having devoted so much of his life to this one project? Actually he has a plan, he tells me. He wants to build an experimental city of 5,000 people from around the world, where everything is recorded and everything is open and transparent. Maybe he’s joking. Coming from anyone else, it would sound utterly ridiculous. With Khrzhanovsky, you can’t be sure.• Commenting on this piece?

Reading have cause to complain about their opponents’ strong arm approach and what looked a very soft goal for the second. With both Chelsea and Manchester City looking on course for three points, this was vital. This title race is very much alive, and Arsenal are back on track, even if they did appear a little underpowered by their long injury list. Filis gets a touch almost instantly, and sets up McCabe for a crashing finish from long range, fully 25 yards out, and that rounds it all off. 90+3 min: Arsenal sub: On come Filis, for her debut, for Veje. 90+3 min: And another! Honnundottir fires straight at the goalie, after a fine dummy from Remi Allen. Good work, but a disappointing shot. 90+2 min: Yet another Reading chance on goal. Arsenal are clearly tired. Jo Potter hits from distance. 90+1 min: Another Williams chance, as Reading go in search of a consolation. That came as a result of Peyraud-Magnin, in Arsenal’s goal, being too quick to get the game restarted. 90 min: Another Williams free-kick, but this one is not good, and it dips and swerves in entirely the wrong direction. Four minutes have been added on to this game. 89 min: A Reading attack - it’s been a while. Honnundottir shows neat control and awareness in setting up a chance for Fara Williams. 87 min: Another Reading change. On comes Jade Bailey for Chaplen. This is, though, a lost cause. 86 min: On the sideline, Moore, who made that penalty challenges, appears to be trying to explain what happened. Innocence is being protested. Let us recall that it was Moore whose contact lens slipped, too. 85 mins: Reading change and on comes Rakel Honnundottir for Moore, the Icelandic player making her debut. 83 min: Another look at the penalty and it might have been an arm, or a thigh obstructing Van de Donk. 82 min: That looked a lucky penalty for Arsenal. Van de Donk fell over, but was it a foul or her losing her balance? They’ll take it, not least because Chelsea are now leading Birmingham. Calm as you like, Little steps up and scores low to her right. Van de Donk turns in the box, and Jade Moore is ruled to have fouled. Had, though, the Dutch player instead tripped on the ball? 78 min: Mead’s long ball is flicked into the path of Miedema, who looked to be tripped but no foul. Mead then gets the ball down the wing, Kim Little looks favourite to score but Pacheco’s tackle stops a certain goal. 76 min: Van de Donk tries to get away in midfield, but loses the ball. Allen is booked for kicking the ball away after a foul is given. 75 min: Another Arsenal yellow card, with Beth Mead leaving some afters on Harding. There is an undercurrent bubbling under this match. 73 min: Arsenal’s need for a win is doubled as Manchester City have taken the lead already against Brighton. 72 min: The Reading bench looks unamused, faces as dark and gloomy as the skies above them. The word is that they are not happy with Arsenal’s persistent fouling. 70 min: Reading pushing on far more than Arsenal. Van Den Donk has barely had a sniff of the ball. It’s been a bitty game. 68 min: McCabe, another one on a booking, is penalised for a foul on Bruton, but no second yellow. She is, though, surely on sudden death now 66 min: Harding, on a yellow, clatters into Mead, goes straight through her, in fact. But that is ruled a fair challenge. In the men’s game, there might have been a bit more writhing from the victim. 65 min: Reading’s Jade Moore is down and the problem appears to be her contact lens. That’s a painful one, and not easy for the physio. Thankfully, the problem is sorted soon enough. 63 min: Another Arsenal free-kick on the left. Mead again takes, Bloodworth is free in the box but her header is poor when she had the freedom of Buckinghamshire to nod the second. 61 min: Mead’s corner comes in, and Louise Quinn comes forward to head over. 60 min: Veje is brought down by a scrabbling Natasha Harding. A yellow card, and deservedly so. McCabe takes the free-kick, but can’t beat the first defender. It’s a corner. 58 min: Chaplen tries another Reading shot from long range. That is either the limit of ambitions or the belief Peyraud-Magnin is weak from distance. 57 min: Arsenal’s great start to this half, just like the first, has faded fast, and they don’t have a goal to boast this time, either. Reading looking more likely? Their problem is the final ball. 55 min: Peyraud-Magnin looks winded but will be fine. Fara Williams takes a corner that Allen gets to but cannot keep down. 53 min: Pacheco is tripped and Reading have another free-kick. Potter takes and Williamson gets the ball clear. But Reading eventually get the ball back, and Fara Williams’ shot is headed goalwards until Peyraud-Magnin makes a fine, and brave, save. The goalie is down hurt after that. 52 min: Arsenal make a sub. On comes Danielle van de Donk for Kuyken, whose debut is at an end. That should increase Arsenal’s threat level. 49 min: Veje forces a corner. Mead takes it short and gets the return, and then pings the ball into the box. Moloney beats it away. Arsenal piling it on, colour-coded notes being adhered to, and Miedema is again the target for a pass into the area. 48 min: Another chance for Miedema, but the ball was just a little too high for her as she ends up heading the ball behind her. Then, Mitchell, from left-back, swings the ball in for Mitchell, and McCabe’s header is smothered. 47 min: Arsenal seek another quick start to the half but the ball is cleared by Reading’s defenders when Miedema was again the target. Miedema’s goal, her 16th of the season, is an all-time record for the WSL. And there are seven games to go. Prolific, as the Opta lads might say in their single-word conclusion to tweets. This is the top tune that has been belting out of the Adams Park PA for the entirety of the break. Half-time reading. Both Chelsea men and women’s team play later. Here’s one for the men’s team on the strikers’ graveyard Stamford Bridge can be. After that early Arsenal goal, this has been an even contest, with Reading giving a couple of scares to the team looking to go back to the top. Aaron D’Antino delays his entry into the dressing room he probably has plenty to say, and his colour coding has perhaps run in the fierce rain. 45 min+3: Arsenal’s Bloodworth makes a sliding challenge on Bruton that might have resulted in a penalty. Bruton hurdled it, perhaps too honest for her own good. 45 min: Four minutes were added on at the end of the half, after a couple of injuries. There is time for Remi Allen to turn and hit a shot at goal that has Peyraud-Magnin scrabbling. That was as dangerous as Reading have been this half. 44 min: Arsenal play some delightful link-up play in midfield, before McCabe tries to find Miedema, before a desperate ball is cleared. On the bench, the Arsenal coach, and manager for the day, Aaron D’Antino, is piling on the notes, and is even changing the pen colour. That’s fastidious stuff.

You may feel you deserve an alcoholic beverage after toughing it out all month – but have you forgotten what it feels like to wake up haunted by worries about what you said or did the night before? These post-drinking feelings of guilt and stress have come to be known colloquially as “hangxiety”. But what causes them?David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, London, is the scientist who was fired in 2009 as the government’s chief drug adviser for saying alcohol is more dangerous than ecstasy and LSD. I tell him I have always assumed my morning-after mood was a result of my brain having shrivelled like a raisin through alcohol-induced dehydration. When Nutt explains the mechanics of how alcohol causes crippling anxiety, he paints an even more offputting picture.Alcohol, he says, targets the Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor, which sends chemical messages through the brain and central nervous system to inhibit the activity of nerve cells. Put simply, it calms the brain, reducing excitement by making fewer neurons fire. “Alcohol stimulates Gaba, which is why you get relaxed and cheerful when you drink,” explains Nutt.The first two drinks lull you into a blissful Gaba-induced state of chill. When you get to the third or fourth drink, another brain-slackening effect kicks in: you start blocking glutamate, the main excitatory transmitter in the brain. “More glutamate means more anxiety,” says Nutt. “Less glutamate means less anxiety.” This is why, he says, “when people get very drunk, they’re even less anxious than when they’re a bit drunk” – not only does alcohol reduce the chatter in your brain by stimulating Gaba, but it further reduces your anxiety by blocking glutamate. In your blissed-out state, you will probably feel that this is all good – but you will be wrong.The body registers this new imbalance in brain chemicals and attempts to put things right. It is a little like when you eat a lot of sweets and your body goes into insulin-producing overdrive to get the blood sugar levels down to normal as soon as the sweets have been digested, all that insulin causes your blood sugar to crash. When you are drunk, your body goes on a mission to bring Gaba levels down to normal and turn glutamate back up. When you stop drinking, therefore, you end up with unnaturally low Gaba function and a spike in glutamate – a situation that leads to anxiety, says Nutt. “It leads to seizures as well, which is why people have fits in withdrawal.”It can take the brain a day or two to return to the status quo, which is why a hair of the dog is so enticing. “If you drank an awful lot for a long time,” says Nutt, “it might take weeks for the brain to readapt. In alcoholics, we’ve found changes in Gaba for years.”To add to the misery, the anxiety usually kicks in while you are trying to sleep off the booze. “If you measure sleep when people are drunk, they go off to sleep fast. They go into a deeper sleep than normal, which is why they sometimes wet the bed or have night terrors. Then, after about four hours, the withdrawal kicks in – that’s when you wake up all shaky and jittery.”Imbalances in Gaba and glutamate are not the only problem. Alcohol also causes a small rise in noradrenaline – known as the fight-or-flight hormone. “Noradrenaline suppresses stress when you first take it, and increases it in withdrawal,” says Nutt. “Severe anxiety can be considered a surge of noradrenaline in the brain.”Another key cause of hangxiety is being unable to remember the mortifying things you are sure you must have said or done while inebriated – another result of your compromised glutamate levels. “You need glutamate to lay down memories,” says Nutt, “and once you’re on the sixth or seventh drink, the glutamate system is blocked, which is why you can’t remember things.”One theory as to why very shy people might be more at risk of hangxiety and alcoholism is the possibility that alcohol’s seesaw effect on Gaba levels is more pronounced in them. Their baseline Gaba levels may be lower to start with, says Morgan. “It could also be a psychological effect – people who are more highly anxious are more prone to rumination, going over thoughts about the night before, so that’s another potential mechanism.”However, the study’s findings have wider implications – after all, most drinkers lean on alcohol as social lubrication to some degree.The bad news is that there seems to be little you can do to avoid hangxiety other than to drink less, and perhaps take painkillers – they will at least ease your headache. “Theoretically, ibuprofen would be better than paracetamol,” says Nutt, “because it’s more anti-inflammatory – but we don’t know how much of the hangover is caused by inflammation. It’s something we’re working on, trying to measure that.”Morgan suggests trying to break the cycle. “Before drinking in a social situation you feel anxious in, try fast-forwarding to the next day when you’ll have much higher anxiety levels. If you can’t ride that out without drinking, the worry is that you will get stuck in this cycle of problematic drinking where your hangxiety is building and building over time. Drinking might fix social anxiety in the short term, but in the long term it might have pretty detrimental consequences.” Exposure therapy is a common treatment for phobias, where you sit with your fear in order to help you overcome it. “By drinking alcohol, people aren’t giving themselves a chance to do that,” says Morgan.Until Alcosynth reaches the market, Nutt says his “strong” message is: “Never treat hangxiety with a hair of the dog. When people start drinking in the mornings to get over their hangxiety, then they’re in the cycle of dependence. It’s a very slippery slope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d85780076468b516c0ed1cbb4c188d1294f8c/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac23a0ce5c1c0f925378a91b8afe8ea6","title":"10 simple signs that youve turned into a responsible adult","story":"Being a child meant no responsibilities. Being adolescent meant ignoring them. But now that you’re a grownup, there’s no running away. Thankfully, there are 10 simple ways to show you’re tackling adulthood like a proRecyclingThere was a time when all your rubbish went into one bin. Not any more. Now it’s a military operation – food, paper, cardboard, bottles and plastic all need to be separated and placed in specific colour-coded containers. But you’re well-drilled, you know the weekly collection rota and you have all the rubbish out the night before. You’ve nailed it.Weekly shopsNo more grazing on sweets in corner shops or picking up a ready meal on the way home from work. You climb in the car on Saturday mornings and drive to a supermarket on the outskirts of town and buy enough groceries to last you all week, resulting in a three-figure bill. Or you order it all online and have it delivered. But it still takes one simple thing that demonstrates you’re an adult: forward planning.Growing plants and vegetablesThis was something that once struck you as OAP behaviour and, frankly, back-breaking work. Then you discovered homegrown vegetables actually taste better and that growing a few plants is good for the soul. Now you visit garden centres and buy tools. Don’t eat at the garden centre cafe, though, that really is for old folk.Work the central heatingIt feels like you have two choices: hand over half your salary to the energy company or freeze. Real adults have mastered the central heating thermostat and the boiler timer and save money and energy as a result. It’s not rocket science, after all. Bonus tip: sign up to EnergyCheck from Compare the Market and it’ll contact you if you could save money on your bill.CleanOnce upon a time, your parents made you clean your room and it felt like punishment. Now you have your own place that is entirely your responsibility to take care of. You embrace it, grab some dusters, spray furniture polish, put on some music and bask in the thrill of sparkling surfaces.Stack the dishwasher correctlyYou used to balk at the washing up. Now you have a dishwasher and know that by arranging the plates at the back, bowls at the front, cutlery upright and cups on the top, it functions properly. Simple chore – such ordered joy.VotingCouncil election, general election, referendum – no matter what it is, you always find the time to vote. When you were younger, you didn’t even know where the polling station was, but then you realised you were making a huge mistake. It was your future they were deciding, after all.Assembling furnitureAs a kid, your parents expected you to make your bed. Now, when you buy one, you actually have to assemble it, too. In fact, all new furniture comes flatpacked, necessitating a crash course in DIY, a properly stocked toolbox and the ability to follow a badly translated set of instructions.Hold a dinner partyGetting a pizza in for the big match is a thing of the past. Now it’s all couples and entertaining. In best MasterChef style, you can prepare and cook at least three dishes, because melting cheese on nachos and buying an M\u0026ampS cheesecake just doesn’t cut it any more.Going to bed at a sensible timeStaying up until dawn gaming or clubbing might be possible at the weekend, but midweek you need a full eight hours or you’re tetchy the next day. Then you get run-down, and you know what happens when you get rundown: it all goes horribly wrong.Prove you’re an adult and download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

From planning meals to advice on decreasing the time you spend managing bills, here are some handy online resources to help tackle time-consuming everyday tasksThere are a few things in life that are seemingly never-ending: taxes, bills and housework, for example. According to research by the Association of Accounting Technicians, adults carry out an average of 109 life-admin tasks a year. The poll, which surveyed 2,000 Britons, found more than half of those taking part struggle to keep up with household paperwork and failed to complete everything by the required date.It also found that four urgent and important tasks are always in the pipeline. Mustering the effort to get them done is another issue altogether, but putting in a bit of effort can save a lot of time – and stress – in the long run. Here are some tips on how to keep on top of things.Offload meal prepEven with an Instagram-worthy pantry, sometimes just deciding what to eat for dinner can be a drain. Luckily, in the past few years, there has been a boom in subscription services. Companies such as HelloFresh allow you to choose up to five meals a week and have all the ingredients and recipes delivered to your door. Allplants is similar but caters to vegans, while Graze will sort out your snacks, and Naked Wines will make sure to deliver some nice wine to enjoy with whatever you cook.Get reminders whenever you can save money on billsCompare the Market has made it simple with EnergyCheck, a service that automatically checks if you could get a better deal than your current energy supplier. Tell them your gas and electricity usage once and you’ll never have to overpay again. Choose your ideal saving amount (£50 or £100, for example) and update your preferences on the go. You’ll get alerts to let you know if you can save, or if you’re still on a great deal – and you can switch energy providers simply.Cut time on managing billsManaging bills and paying them on time is one of the most common life-admin tasks and one that can have expensive consequences if they are not dealt with on time. Apps such as Splitwise help split bills between groups – such as housemates – so everyone pays a fair share and knows exactly what they owe. WonderBill gets all your household bills in one place, so there is no sifting through piles of paperwork or old emails to figure out which one needs to be paid and when.Automate your savingsSaving money can be a strain if you’re struggling to budget. But bank apps and money bots are great for finding ways to stockpile your piggy bank. Some allow users to set up savings “pots”, which automatically round up purchases to the nearest pound and collect the leftover change, which adds up surprisingly quickly. Then there are AI chatbots such as Cleo or Plum, which take the thinking out of money management by learning their users’ spending habits and sending out personalised prompts that remind them to put a little bit away for a rainy day.Make the most of your appsHaving all your devices sync together and talk seamlessly can save you a lot of time. If This Then That (IFTTT) is a platform that helps make this a reality. It allows you to create customised “applets” and use ones others have created to make day-to-day tasks a little bit easier. It works on the premise of “if this happens, then that happens”. So, for example, if you complete a workout on a fitness app then Google logs it in your calendar.Clean up your computerOne way to save time before you even begin a life-admin task is having everything properly organised – including on your computer. But, with all the photos, files, and apps that gradually pile up, organising your laptop can be a major life-admin task in itself. Using apps such as Hazel will help automatically organise files based on name, date and file type – plus you can have it rename files and sort them into subfolders so they can be accessed, deleted or backed up. To start automating your life, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

Now it just makes me sad. With public discourse increasingly polarised, all views cheered or jeered by a baying crowd online and off, Question Time is the public square where we get to watch bears being poked. It not only televises the deep isions in the country, but the uncomfortable position the BBC adopts to straddle them.Since replacing the veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby with Fiona Bruce, the show has stirred up a hornets’ nest of rightleft ision in just three episodes, ending last week with a clarification about whether Labour or the Tories were ahead in opinion polls, which reminded us why BBC bureaucracy is the subject of such satire.To recap: Bruce’s second episode prompted loud support from Conservative voices such as Sarah Vine and the  but more than 100 complaints over the show’s treatment of the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, and a Momentum petition for an apology.By replacing Dimbleby with a BBC newsreader best known for helping members of the public sell things they find in the attic on Antiques Roadshow, the BBC hoped to find a figurehead who spoke for the ordinary viewer. She is more shire than Westminster no wonder the , which sends Bruce to report on nice holidays, loves her.The affair raises important issues for the BBC about impartiality and trust. Ofcom, currently reviewing its news ision, said when it was launched: “As national debates become more polarised, it becomes harder for broadcasters to be seen to be accurate and impartial. The BBC has to ensure it devotes the appropriate resources to maintain its position.”Here are some suggestions. First, spend time and money on basic fact-checking. The presenter of Question Time does not need to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hansard, but a proper knowledge of that day’s opinion polls is pretty much baseline. When a politician claims their party is “level-pegging” in the polls, the presenter cannot sneer, as Bruce did, “you’re behind, Diane” without knowing for sure they are right. Again, this is not just a criticism of Bruce. Why was there no producer whispering in her ear “actually Fiona, the polls are little more complicated than that.” Everyone makes mistakes, even the best, most knowledgeable journalists muck it up, especially when live on air and dealing with tricky politicians and panellists. Why can’t the BBC simply admit an error quickly and with grace and move on? Instead, its often weird approach makes things worse.Having failed to offer clarification by the end of the Abbott show, the BBC instead issued a weird statement 24 hours later mentioning “inaccurate and misleading” social media comments. Then on Twitter it stated: “A YouGov poll published on the day of the programme suggested a lead for the Conservatives. Diane Abbott was also right that some other polls suggested Labour either as ahead or tied, and we should have made that clear.”Then, Bruce waited until halfway through the next show to issue another clarification of sorts. “I just want to pick up on something from last week’s programme,” she began. “There was some discussion about opinion polls … I was talking about a poll which came out on the day of the programme which suggested the Conservatives were ahead. The shadow home secretary mentioned some other, earlier polls which showed Labour in the lead and we should have made that context clear, and I’m really happy to do that now.”The timing was to “fit in” with the flow of the show, but the tone was a bit “you ordinary people out there probably don’t even care about the polls.” Which may be true, but everyone who pays for it cares about the BBC getting it right and not being too grand to admit when it gets stuff wrong. It simply needs to be transparent rather than defensive when it makes mistakes, which are tiny in comparison with its vast output but nonetheless magnified not just by its vexatious critics but its own flat-footed reactions.The increasingly fractious treatment of people in the public eye is enough to make anyone defensive, of course. BBC journalists talk privately of being so hounded after admitting minor errors they vow never to do it again unless forced.Finally – and this is more difficult for a broadcaster keen to generate debate and maintain audience figures – Question Time needs to stop being so confrontational. The editor, Hilary O’Neill, promised “adrenaline-packed Thursday nights” when she was appointed. Yet 18 months later few seem concerned that the hormone not only sets pulses racing but closes the ability to think clearly.Ever since the appearance of the far-right leader Nick Griffin in 2009 gave the show its highest-ever ratings of 8 million, the show has increasingly courted controversial guests. Hence, Nigel Farage appears more frequently than his position would perhaps warrant.Seek out controversy by all means but realise that the end result is a dead bear, not valid debate.Of all the issues facing the BBC, the calm marshalling of facts is the most important, mostly because it is the central weapon against allegations of false equivalence. On climate change, the BBC no longer insists on seeking out the one voice who rejects the consensus. Impartiality does not mean saying that both sides are the same, when facts suggest that they are not. Fear of abuse does not help here either.One example from Question Time in recent weeks that has prompted fewer headlines concerns a comment Bruce made about the referendum campaigns. When an audience member said leave ran a “dirty campaign”, Bruce responded that there had been “questions over both leave and remain”.Paul Lashmar, the investigative journalist behind the documentary Who Paid for Brexit?, complained to the BBC that remain’s use of occasionally inaccurate economic forecasts was not the same as being fined and investigated by the National Crime Agency. There has been no response yet.These are difficult issues and, in the hurly-burly of a political debate, no one will always get it right. Bruce made a great start in her first week acting on behalf of the audience. The presenter of Question Time needs to speak for the audience, not play to it a journalist, not a celebrity. Ofcom’s own research suggests that the BBC gets it right most of the time, with high scores for trust and accuracy. The BBC could argue that the “ordinary people” who watch the show, rather than sad journalists who like to comment, don’t care about political spats and Twitter apoplexy. But those pesky opinion polls show that they do care about the BBC, as should we all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/589bffd66fb4f791cbb458dbc0feac677e16a0d0/32_0_1980_1188/master/1980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8043c85677f2a949448d921c10e2f459","title":"mortgage application income inflate refusal","story":"It’s one of the things that could lead to a refusal, making it harder to get a future loan Homebuyers have been warned to avoid inflating their income when applying for a mortgage, which can lead to their application being rejected. New figures show that one in six homeowners had been refused a home loan in the past. This crucially can lead to delays in being accepted for another at a later date.Consumer group Which? found the highest number of refusals was in the capital – far higher than the national average – with one in three mortgage holders saying they had been refused in the past. London is followed by the West Midlands.Among the reasons for banks turning people down has been applicants overstating how much they earn, such as including overtime payments with their main salary.While some banks allow this and others permit certain percentages of extra payments to be included, a failure to be clear can result in problems, warns Which?.It described the results of the survey as surprising and says that many people expect the application process to be straightforward with little chance of being refused.It is typically those aged between 18 and 24 who are turned down with the numbers reducing as the applicants get older.The rejection can lead to frustrating delays. More than half of those surveyed took a further three months to be accepted for another mortgage. This can result in delays along the buying chain and open up the possibility of a sale being stalled or even falling through.Applying for a mortgage will be noted on someone’s credit history, so in the case that they are refused by one lender, a subsequent bank may query why the first one declined.“While a mortgage rejection isn’t the end of the road when buying a home, it can clearly have a detrimental impact on the rest of your home-buying experience,” says David Blake from Which? mortgage advisers.“Ensure you have all the documents and relevant information you need before submitting your application and don’t overstretch your finances by applying for a loan that you won’t be able to afford.”There are a number of reasons why applications are refused – for example, a poor credit score, or being unable to provide proper documents.Lack of a paper trail can arise from an applicant having just started a new job and not having evidence of payments. People may also ask for too much money and if they are not registered to vote where they live, this can also work against them.Such simple factors could affect those who have lived in a house share and never had a bill in their name, or someone who moved from place to place and did not change where they vote when they switched.Which? has advised people to consider getting a “mortgage in principle” which means the lender is willing to give money in theory, thus giving the buyer an idea of the budget that they are operating under.Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert advises that longer and more stable credit relationships are important. Buyers are advised to keep up to date on all bill repayments, as defaults will count against them, and avoid applying for credit in the three months before applying for a mortgage.Lenders may probe how many times credit is applied for - if there are a large number of searches in a short space of time, this could raise alarm bells."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf6f3bcf5386560502e66d60a41f42d13fdb398/0_135_8574_5144/master/8574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed616cd1b5840cbbff4d53f627e7b662","title":"working mothers more stressed health","story":"Professor Tarani Chandola, of Manchester University, and Dr Cara Booker, Professor Meena Kumari and Professor Michaela Benzeval, of the Institute for Social and Economic Research at Essex University, examined biological data taken by nurses from 6,025 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, the largest survey of its kind in the world.They adjusted the raw data to exclude other factors that could influence their findings, such as the women’s ages, ethnicity, education, occupation and income, allowing them to focus solely on working hours and family conditions.According to their research, just published in the journal Sociology, neither working from home nor flexitime had an effect on women’s chronic stress levels. But reducing the number of hours they worked did have a positive impact.“Work-family conflict is associated with increased psychological strain, with higher levels of stress and lower levels of wellbeing,” Chandola said. “Parents of young children are at particular risk of work-family conflict. Working conditions that are not flexible to these family demands, such as long working hours, could adversely impact on a person’s stress reactions.”Overall, the 11 indicators, known as “biomarkers”, produce something called an “allostatic load”, a measure of the cumulative wear and tear on the body’s physiological systems, which can indicate poor health and a greater risk of death.“Repeated stressful events arising from combinations of social and environmental stressors and major traumatic life events result in chronic stress, which in turn affects health,” Kumari said.“Flexible work practices are meant to enable employees to achieve a more satisfactory work-life balance, which should reduce work-family conflict,” Benzeval said. “The use of such reduced-hours flexible work arrangements appeared to moderate some of the association of family and work stressors. But there was little evidence that flexplace or flextime working arrangements were associated with lower chronic stress responses.”The researchers also discovered that fathers’ markers could be lowered if they worked reduced hours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498776d75c2637ab51c19e5b3891fa73e14efb41/7_838_1865_1118/master/1865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=934da6e88a33074da5a3cc87527acccc","title":"going underground mod revival fanzines in pictures modzines","story":"Over the past year, Acid Jazz label ownerDJ Ed Piller and designer Steve Rowland have been putting together a book of mod revival fanzines from 1978 to 1984, entitled Modzines. “They’re an important social record,” Piller says. “By 1980, the mainstream media was virtually ignoring the enormous mod revival, apart from to disparage it.” Fanzines existed to “inform mods about culture, fashion and music”, says Piller.

No deal has gone from being one of several possible scenarios to a firm date in the diary.”Labour MP Yvette Cooper has revealed to the Observer that two major employers in her West Yorkshire constituency – luxury goods manufacturer Burberry and confectioner Haribo – had both written to her, warning of the damaging effects of no deal on their UK operations. Burberry employs 750 people in Castleford, and Haribo 700 across her constituency.Cooper is pushing for a Commons amendment – likely to be voted on in Tuesday’s debate – that would pave the way for Brexit to be delayed until the end of this year.Last week some of the UK’s largest employers – including Airbus, Europe’s largest aerospace manufacturer, which employs 14,000 people in the UK and supports another 110,000 through supply chains – warned of potentially disastrous effects of no deal on its UK activities.Tom Enders, the boss of Airbus, said: “Please don’t listen to the Brexiters’ madness, which asserts that because we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong.”Ever since the vote to leave the EU in 2016, business groups including the BCC and the Confederation of British Industry have lobbied ministers, arguing that our exporters need access to the EU’s customs union, which allows goods to be imported tariff-free.But the prime minister has insisted that the UK must leave both the customs union and EU single market if it the referendum result of 2016 is to be fully respected.Business concerns are growing as Downing Street braces for a series of Commons ambushes over Brexit this week. As well as moves to delay the date of leaving beyond 29 March, MPs worried about a cliff-edge exit or a hard Brexit are also planning to force a series of “indicative votes” in parliament on a range of alternative ways forward. These include a Norway-style arrangement and a second referendum.Some ministers, including Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and Richard Harrington, the business minister, have signalled they could quit if May does not allow them to back plans to delay Brexit by granting all Tory MPs including ministers a free vote on the issue.Meanwhile, some pro-Brexit cabinet ministers are pushing the PM to submit her own amendment pledging to renegotiate her Brexit deal, in a bid to win over Tory Brexiters and the Northern Irish DUP. Concerns are growing within the Tory party that the impasse may end in a snap election.Today, writing in the Observer, cabinet minister David Lidington says he shares the concerns of those worried about no deal and says the government intends to put a revised deal back to the Commons for another “meaningful vote” next month. “Once we have a blueprint for a plan that can secure the support of the House, the prime minister will go back to the EU,” Lidington writes. “MPs will then have another meaningful vote as soon as possible.”Meanwhile European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned Theresa May in a private phone call that shifting her position in favour of a permanent customs union is the price she will need to pay for the EU revising the Irish backstop.He said without a major shift in the PM’s position, the current terms of the withdrawal agreement were “non-negotiable”. Details of the call, contained in a leaked diplomatic note, emerged as Juncker’s deputy, Frans Timmermans, told the Observer that there had been no weakening of the resolve in Brussels in support of Ireland, and accused the Tory Brexiters of a “cavalier” approach to peace. “Let me be extremely clear: there is no way I could live in a situation where we throw Ireland under the bus,” Timmermans said.

For my first, we flew in from New Zealand to our base. From the air it’s just blue and white: icebergs and sea ice, and valleys full of high-glaciated mountains. You don’t see any wildlife and even seeing exposed rock is a rarity. It’s stunning. The runway at the research base is ice, no tarmac. Stepping off the plane, the air is so cold and dry (it’s often around -25C) that it instantly sucks the moisture out of everything. It can be hard to breathe.I’m doing a PhD looking at how the oceans are melting Antarctic ice shelves. An ice shelf is like a cork in a bottle – if you pull out the cork, grounded ice starts to flow more rapidly into the ocean. The work I’m doing is measuring the Totten Glacier, which is in quite a vulnerable region.We go in the summer months – December and January. There’s daylight 24 hours a day. For maybe an hour the sun dips below the horizon and it gets a little dusky. The research base is a small, closed community of scientists and base staff. I struggle with the danger of the cold and that it keeps you confined to the base a lot of the time. If you want to get out and have time on your own, you have to jump through a lot of hoops. With the remote location, I find the loss of personal freedom hard. I miss feeling in control of my own life.I work in a team of four and our trips are 10 weeks long. We are flown to the glacier. The first time we got dropped off, and the helicopter flew away, I was overwhelmed to be in such an isolated place. I felt like a tiny person in a huge expanse and it was quiet, quiet, quiet like you couldn’t believe. It was emotionally intense.Our priority is to find six equipment towers in the snow that were placed on the glacier the previous year. They’re light aluminium frames that house our monitoring equipment. Year to year the towers move up to 1km due to the flow of the glacier. We only have the last known GPS positions to try to locate them.The biggest challenge is keeping my hands warm, because I need good dexterity. I work with them bare and then ball them up quickly in big mittens. I don’t use gloves, because as soon as my fingers are separate they’re gone. I’m also never without my Thermos. I quite happily immerse myself in my new little community and don’t miss my friends and family too much. But when I return to Hobart I’m happy to no longer have to always tell someone where I’m going, or have to take someone else along with me.There are three doors to get into the freezer. They’re sealed and air-locked to keep the cold in. When you enter, you get a big waft of cold air in your face. The temperature’s between -18C and -25C. But if you’re working at the back when the fans kick in, it feels like -30C. Sometimes you find snowflakes hanging about.If I’m doing a morning shift I get up at 4am, but I have to be quiet as I have a missus and three children. I’ll put on my thermal socks, thermal vest, T-shirt, sweatshirt and jacket. And then a woolly jacket. When I get to work I put on a pair of overalls, a freezer jacket, freezer boots and woolly hat. Over that I wear a hard hat that has a neck wrap and ear muffs. The warehouse is quite dark, like a cave. It’s filled with long aisles and pallets stacked high. We mainly store meat: there’s beef, lamb, chicken and turkeys for Christmas. It comes from all over: Spain, Italy, Brazil. Tesco stores salmon here, also Greggs, Wetherspoon’s. We have other bits and bobs, too. Last year we had big ice sculptures and ice glasses for an ice bar in London, and we’ve had ice samples from the Antarctic for scientists.After about half an hour my goatee starts to frost up. After two hours I look like Santa Claus. My beard goes hard and when I breathe I feel it melt and run, and then it’ll refreeze. Sometimes my lips get stuck together.The summer months are the weirdest, because first you come out of the warehouse and get blinded by the sun and then after a few minutes of warming up you start sweating, so you take all your gear off. When I leave, I stay away from heat to let my fingers defrost by themselves, otherwise you get a horrible burning feeling.I’ve done this job for five years and I enjoy it. The day goes fast, as there’s so much to do. I started as a warehouse operative and worked my way up. I now introduce new staff to the freezer. After 20 minutes some will say: “Nah, not for me, far too cold.” The more you think about it, the more you get cold. If you just focus on the job, you crack on and get it done.Jimmy Tart, 41, ski patroller and avalanche educator, UtahI experienced hypothermia while working once. In 2005 I was in Vail, Colorado, and was standing on a ridgeline for more than an hour in 60mph winds that created a -40C wind-chill zone. It was the day after a big storm and the visibility was low. It’s an understatement to say I felt cold. It was awful. It became difficult to move. When your body temperature drops below a certain point, blood stops being sent to your appendages in an effort to keep your brain warm. I stopped shivering. My hands and feet felt like ice blocks.I’ve been working in snow safety for 16 years. I’m trained to forecast, avoid and mitigate avalanches and to educate the public on them. On a morning with new snow, I go with a team up to ski areas and we plan out and cause controlled avalanches while the area is closed. We use our knowledge of the terrain and watch weather patterns, because that drives everything. For example, winds can transport snow to a sheltered slope and force the top layer of snow grains together, creating a hard slab to form over soft, older snow. The effect is like putting a textbook on top of potato chips it becomes vulnerable to collapse. To make areas like that safe, we throw 2lb hand explosives into the snow to create pressure that can trigger an avalanche. Our work makes the danger of avalanches to the public minimal. But to us it can still be very real.On that morning in 2005 it was all well planned, as it always is – multiple teams working their way down the ridgeline, coordinating on radio so we don’t get underneath somebody who’s about to create an avalanche. But small delays here and there, and the next thing we knew, my route partner and I were standing out for longer than we should have been. Our supervisor, Colin, had skied down to a safe spot about 500ft below us to assess the conditions in the bowl. We told him we had one explosive left, and, to avoid the hazard of taking it back to our cache, he told us to throw it. We threw it into the bowl where we’d already put multiple charges, but it created an unexpected mid-size avalanche above where Colin was standing. The avalanche was large enough to bury people and trees.It must have taken between 10 to 15 seconds for the avalanche to run its path and the powder cloud to settle. I was looking down and knew something wasn’t right, but my brain was working so slowly I couldn’t tell what it was. We tried to call Colin, but he didn’t respond. I wasn’t panicking, because I couldn’t think properly. The powder cloud following the avalanche had knocked Colin off his feet and he had nearly been buried. Luckily the debris flow missed him and he was OK. Not being able to think during something so dangerous was a strange sensation.The job involves a lot of standing around in snow. We also forecast for avalanches by digging deep pits that we climb into and analyse the stratigraphy, which are the layers of snow caused by different weather. The avalanche danger can be determined by studying the layers and how they relate to each other.I’ve found it’s always better to carry more layers than you think you’re going to need – the extra weight is worth it. And I always tell people to wear warmer gloves than they think they need, too. When I really feel it, push-ups are my go-to to get the blood flowing.I grew up in Texas, where everything is unbearably hot. I remember being eight and riding to a friend’s house on summer break and thinking my brain was melting. Maybe, subconsciously, that’s why I ended up doing this work.After the fall of the Soviet Union there was no work for me. I had to think of a way to provide for my family, so I decided to create my own smallholding. I have 100 horses and work with my son and brother-in-law.Our horses are bred to grow extra fur in time for winter and to get a layer of fat for warmth. It enables them to live outside when it’s incredibly cold. Here it ranges from -20C to -50C in the winter. It’s important for us to dress warmly because you don’t want to lose an ear or a finger. It’s not uncommon for that to happen to people the trauma centre in Yakutsk, the nearest city, conducts dozens of amputations every year of fingers and toes due to frostbite. I’ve experienced -67C, but I have to work outside every day. I don’t mind. We’re in the mountains and being in nature is the best way to spend time.Oymyakon is 1,000km from Yakutsk. It takes 30 hours to get here by car when the roads are frozen. About 1,000 people live here. Homes are wooden and heated with wood or coal fire. Our toilets have to be outside because it’s too cold for plumbing. We don’t use our fridges in winter – we just keep things outside. There are only four hours of daylight then, so in the evenings the streets are empty. Most people stay inside and watch TV. I like the news and talk shows, and I also like to read, especially historical fiction.This weather is normal to us. Nothing really stops here, we drive (if our cars don’t freeze) or walk to work. The school only closes when it goes below -52C outside. When it’s very cold the little children are often taken on a sleigh. No one really complains about the cold for us, this is natural. We live 3,000m above sea level and it’s beautiful and wild. We’re so used to it that it’s actually difficult for us to travel anywhere south and acclimatise. It’s so cold here that there are few diseases and we can easily get sick when we go somewhere warmer.I’ve always liked the cold. It means we can travel and hunt – and the things that I make sell better. We live at the mouth of a river on Lake Iliamna in Alaska. There are about 60 people in our village. When the lake freezes from December to around May, we use the ice as a highway to get from village to village. A week at -35C is enough to freeze it solid. This year it was late to freeze.Subsistence has been part of my life since I was young. At least half of our family’s diet comes from indigenous fish, plants and animals that we hunt, gather and preserve ourselves. I work really hard. The older of my five children help whenever they can, and my husband works, too.We hunt caribou and moose in the winter, and also trap fur animals such as wolverines, wolves, beavers, otters and lynxes. We use the fur for our warm winter gear. We travel out and bury the traps in the snow. Most of the time the men skin the animals, but my husband cut himself deeply once while skinning a wolverine and, as I didn’t want the coat to go bad, I took over and finished it off. Now I always do it because I’m better and more careful.It’s coldest in March. The lowest temperature I’ve known is -45C. As long as you have the right gear to deal with it, the cold is good. I wear fur hats made from seal and sea otter and gauntlet-style mittens over gloves – my daughter and I make them for the whole family. We also make gumukluks, which is the local dialect for shoes made out of skins. But most of us wear bunny boots now: they’re military shoes made from rubber with air pockets in them that trap heat. They’re awesome and last forever.We also ice-fish in the winter. We make a hole with an ice pick and use a pole made from a skinny tree branch with a small amount of fishing line, and salmon eggs as bait. We mainly catch trout. Ice fishing only gives us enough for one night’s meal though. The summer months are when we catch most fish. For my size of family, I have to catch and smoke about 700 salmon to last a year. We used to store them outdoors in caches, which are tiny houses on high stilts, but now that we have freezers. I put them in there.In winter, we have about five hours of daylight. Things slow down, it’s not quite hibernating, but almost. Electricity changed how we live. With TV and artificial light we stay up longer and I sew. But we don’t use too much electricity, because it’s expensive. They have to fly diesel into our village for the generator. It used to come by barge, but the water level dropped and they can’t get up the river now.In the past 16 years the lake hasn’t frozen for two or three winters, which scares me. We can’t hunt, trap, ice-fish or travel to see people. It’s harder to live. We don’t get berries in the spring. It makes me worry the permafrost will melt under our house and it will slide into the river some of the banks are already eroding around us. I put a lot of my life savings into building this house. I think it will be OK here for about 20 years, but over time it will turn into a desert, as we don’t get much rain and now we’re getting less snow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

As a result of the agreement, payments of a few thousand pounds up to more than £100,000 in some cases will be made between April and the end of the year. Cross’s supporters say the payout was far greater than would have been achieved if it had been left to the unions.Loved by many of his clients, Cross cuts a flamboyant figure. He has admitted to using his Ferrari to do the school run. Companies House reveals that he recently set up a company called Cross Family Investments. Action4Equality Scotland has assets of more than £3.3m, according to filings at Companies House.“We will earn for 14 years’ work less than many other Scottish lawyers, including some trade union lawyers, have earned over the same period,” Cross said. “We are proud of our achievements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dab7fea1781793c22e290d3d89aca9a1317b3e5/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5afa2ddd639dd0db97afd8198ee245a4","title":"six nations preview shadow of world cup special edge","story":"With three of the four top-ranked teams in action and Japan 2019 looming, focus and intrigue will be at fever pitchIn January spring still feels far away, never mind the summer beyond it. But the start of the Six Nations, like the first green shoots, is a sign they are on their way. The tournament starts with the first snowdrops and finishes with the first swallows. When this year’s edition is over, the World Cup will be only six months and six days away, and the six teams, their players and coaches, will have a handful of August warm-ups left to finish getting ready for the tournament they have been working towards these last four years and which, if they win it, will define their playing lives. It is a thought that sharpens the mind.Right now the World Cup is not a topic either Joe Schmidt or Eddie Jones wants to dwell on. During the Six Nations launch last Wednesday both men said they were too busy planning for their opening game of the tournament, when their teams play each other in Dublin, to spare talk or thought on anything after. “I’m not looking as far as the World Cup. I’m not really even looking as far as Scotland,” said Schmidt. Ireland travel up to Murrayfield in the second week. It felt as if he and Jones were both protesting just a touch too much. Whoever wins will be laying down an ante for everyone else to match.Ireland start as favourites, for the first match and the championship. They are at an all-time high in the world rankings after their famous first home win against New Zealand. Officially they are still a point-and-some behind the All Blacks but Steve Hansen, New Zealand’s head coach, says the 16-9 win made them the lineal champions. “As of now, Ireland are the No 1 team in the world, so that the result makes them favourites for the World Cup.” Hansen, like Jones and everyone else, knows that the Irish have never been so far as the semi-finals before and was happy to heap a little extra pressure on.“Well, they’ve got to carry it, mate, haven’t they?” Jones said, with a wicked little grin, when he was asked whether the stress would get to the Irish. “We’ll have to wait and see how they go.” Judging by the way their captain, Rory Best, was talking, they will handle it just fine.Best said that in their own minds Ireland were favourites for last year’s championship too and, while all this hype is “something we can’t get away from because we hear so much about it,” he does not see why this year’s championship will be any different “just because it’s being shouted a little bit louder from external sources”.There was a certain steady confidence about Schmidt, too, and his matter-of-fact evaluation of England’s strengths. Unlike Jones, Schmidt does not like, or need, to play mind games. “It’s always hard with Eddie, because you don’t know if what he’s saying is what he’s really thinking so there’s a bit of double jeopardy,” Schmidt said. He is betting Jones is not bluffing when he talks about how brutal the match is going to be. “I do think that power game is something they may well bring to Dublin.” He winced as he listed off a few of the threats: Billy, Mako, Maro, Manu. “I’m just thinking of bruises, really.”As for England, Jones said the match “isn’t about making statements”. But after a year in which they seemed to take three steps back, England could surely use the sort of resounding performance that would show they are right back on track, whatever he says. “I’ve been in four World Cups,” Jones continued, “and the only thing that matters at the World Cup is how you are at the World Cup. How you are now doesn’t affect how you are at the World Cup. So the only thing we’re worried about now is being at our best for Ireland. That’s the only thing that concerns us.”Warren Gatland, who seems so at ease at the start of his last year in charge of Wales, was the one coach who was willing to admit he was thinking about the bigger picture. “While the focus is on having a good Six Nations, it’s also on thinking about the end of the year.” Wales start away in France and Gatland has said over and over again that, if they win in Paris, he thinks Wales will take the title too because “traditionally we’re a team that, the more momentum and confidence we get early in this tournament, the stronger we get towards the end of it.”After they play France Wales are taking 31 players to a six-day camp in Nice before their second game, against Italy in Rome, “to replicate what’s going to happen in the World Cup”. Wales have won nine Tests in a row now and risen to third in the rankings. All the while Gatland has been busy thinking about what went wrong in 2015. He says he has fixed it this time around. “We were decimated by injury in 2015,” he said, “and we spoke then about the plan for 2019. Twelve months ago I made a lot of changes when we played Italy and I was accused of being disrespectful but I was thinking about the bigger picture and the World Cup 2019. It was the same when we played South Africa in Washington, Argentina and Tonga last year.”Gatland says his squad have the strength in depth to cope. We will soon find out if he is right, because Wales have got the longest injury list of anyone. If he is, Wales look well placed. Remember, Gatland says, they were close enough last year: “If Stockdale hadn’t intercepted that pass…” He was thinking of the match they lost in Dublin: “… you could have had a different winner in the Six Nations.”First, though, France. “Warren’s created continuity, stability, coherence,” says Jacques Brunel, sounding envious. It is not so much that no one knows what to expect of the French, more that French do not know what to expect of themselves. When asked if he knew who was likely to be in his World Cup squad, Brunel shrugged, sighed and said no. “We don’t have really an idea. I could tell you a skeleton of what the team will be, then we’ll have to flesh the rest out.” With five uncapped players in his Six Nations squad, it feels as if he is hoping it will all fall together at the last minute.In Edinburgh the Italians are desperate to prove they are on the same level as the Scots, while the Scots are desperate to prove they are not. “Italy always believe they can beat us, and the players understand that,” says Greig Laidlaw, “but we’ll reiterate it.” His opposing captain, Sergio Parisse, promised his team are not “coming to Murrayfield just to watch Scotland play rugby”. For the Scots, though, the real problem is not what happens at Murrayfield, where they have lost only one Six Nations game in three years, but away from it, where they have won only two in the same time, and both in Rome.Leave the last word for Brunel. “Who’s going to win? Every year, you ask me this question, every year I say the same thing. This is January, the tournament is about to begin, nobody knows who is going to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea7e842ceb9b5089b96124f93ec3539ff390f01/0_0_5075_3383/master/5075.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b469e7aad79c00b6afcc128703e7c56f 1400w","title":"saturday night live james mcavoy steve martin roger stone","story":"As an incomprehensible air traffic controller, a Philly meathead and a gay Mr Tumnus, the Scottish actor powered a fine showThis week’s Saturday Night Live opens with Tucker Carlson Tonight. The high-pitched, constantly constipated-looking Fox host (played by Alex Moffat) is joined by judge Jeannine Pirro (Cecily Strong) and decrepit secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross (Kate McKinnon, under a mountain of old age makeup), both of whom attempt to spin the end of the government shutdown, for which Donald Trump was “finally able to get no wall”.Eventually, Carlson brings on Roger Stone (Steve Martin), fresh from his indictment and very public arrest. Martin’s Stone is appropriately grotesque, even if any attempt to parody such a bizarre personage is something of an effort in futility. Martin is always a welcome presence, so one has to wonder why more of the cold open didn’t revolve around him.Glass star James McAvoy hosts for the first time and rocks a kilt for his monologue, during which he highlights some of the achievements of his country: it’s the home of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, television inventor John Logie Baird, and deep-fired Mars Bar inventor “wee Patrick from down the road, who was stoned out of his nut”. Towards the end of the segment he flubs a line and loses his train of thought, but he charms his way through.In Virgin Hunk, McAvoy plays 26-year-old Dolton (from Turd River, Colorado), who hopes to find his soulmate among a group of “30 women who didn’t vote”. He cycles through the “randos” vying for his affection, each more crazy, desperate and conniving than the last, all while straining to keep himself from bursting. An exceptionally strong takedown of The Bachelor in all its materialistic shamelessness, it’s also a great vehicle for the women to showcase their screwball talents.Next is Mr H, a send up of trite “hood-to-Harvard” dramas (think Dangerous Minds or Freedom Writers), with McAvoy as a noble teacher attempting to pull a gifted student (Chris Redd) out of the hood. At least, that’s what the student assumes. It turns out that he’s not all that gifted and his teacher is really just looking to score some mushrooms for the weekend. It’s a precise and savage send-up, with McAvoy and Redd nailing their archetypes.In Air Traffic Control, McAvoy is a Scottish air traffic controller who attempts to advise an untrained pilot in an emergency landing. Thanks to his thick brogue, he proves completely incomprehensible to the baffled American. This sketch is a fun excuse to revel in Scottish patois and, like The Male Virgin, it’s packed with so many good lines that it demands repeat viewings.The UES is a rap from Leslie Jones, in which she reps her current stomping grounds of New York’s Upper East Side. Jones is a talented emcee but the jokes seem unlikely to land all that hard with anyone outside NYC.The clear winner of the night, Charmin revolves around a focus panel conducted by the toilet paper manufacturer and made up of a collection of utter morons, including a man who can’t tell the difference between reality and cartoons, a Philadelphia meathead, a horny professor and a woke college student defined entirely by her self-aware sense of white privilege. McAvoy is the standout as the Phillie knucledragger and his high-concept, scatologically-obsessed ramblings draw the biggest laughs of the night. If – when – he hosts again, count on this character returning.Rapper Meek Mill is this week’s musical guest. He performs the song Uptown Vibes. Weekend Update then tackles the president’s big defeat, as well as the arrest of “long-time Trump advisor and business Babadook” Roger Stone. Stone is a wellspring of material, with Update co-host Michael Che especially taken by the former Nixon aide’s well-documented history of “asking black guys to bang his wife”.Mr Tumnus features McAvoy as the faun from CS Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, who he played in the 2005 film, receiving a home visit from three nerdy would-be groupies. It turns out he’s become “an unlikely sex symbol for a very specific type of woman: a sort-of lazy Hermione, if you will”. Unfortunately for them, he’s also gay and in a relationship with a grown-up Edmund Pevensie. While not huge on laughs, fans of the Narnia series should get a big kick out of this sketch.Meek Mill returns to the stage and performs the deeply personal Championships. Next, I Love My Dog is a new rap from Chris Redd and Pete Davidson, featuring turns by Keenan Thompson and Ego Nwodim. The song, in which they profess their undying love for their furry pets, edges a bit too far into cutesy territory, but McAvoy saves it. His violently psychotic DJ –whose aggro tirades continuously stop the track dead – is yet another standout turn.New Orleans Vacation brings back Heidi Gardner’s professional tourist Diedre (last seen in episode three). She’s joined by her new boyfriend, a moronic Southern hipster named Reynolds, with whom she just returned from a trip to New Orleans (or, as they continually refer to it, N’awlins). Together, the navel-gazing pair ruin a late-night dinner with friends. SNL goes to the “self-absorbed aloof couples” well far too often, but this is still a fun sketch to go out on.All told, McAvoy killed it as host in what was the most consistently enjoyable episode of the season. As was the case with this year’s other standout hosts – Adam Driver, Liev Schreiber and Claire Foy – SNL in its current state seems best suited to serious actors with real range. Here’s hoping we get more this season, and that McAvoy returns sooner rather than later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29a8cd44d6abdaa8ccc9655b9b27d9abd973f4c/0_69_2790_1675/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c73ca0ffd4175afbdc3effd2d9517b1","title":"maduro rejects ultimatum on fresh elections in venezuela","story":"Crisis-hit country’s president under pressure as US urges the world to ‘pick a side’Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, has rejected an international ultimatum to call elections within eight days, and said the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, had violated the country’s constitution by declaring himself leader.In an interview with CNN Türk aired on Sunday, Maduro also said he was open to dialogue and that meeting the US president, Donald Trump, was improbable but not impossible. The broadcaster dubbed the interview from Spanish into Turkish.On Saturday, Washington, which has recognised Guaidó as leader, urged the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and financially disconnect from Maduro’s government.Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro, with food shortages and protests. The country’s economic and political crisis has prompted mass emigration, and inflation is predicted to rise to 10 million per cent this year.Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognise Guaidó if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister called “childlike”.The US, Canada, most Latin American nations and many European states labelled Maduro’s second-term election win last May fraudulent.Maduro retains the loyalty of the armed forces, though Venezuela’s top military envoy to the US defected to Guaidó on Saturday.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had voiced his support for Maduro in a phone call on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50802c46af020201c5873a8d0405abd5446903d6/0_327_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b499f43809bae48f083ab71ed3461c0d","title":"one in 20 britons does not believe holocaust happened","story":"Almost half of those questioned said they did not know how many Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, and one in five grossly underestimated the number, saying that fewer than two million were killed. At least six million Jews died.The poll, commissioned by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, a charity established and funded by the UK government to promote and support the international day of remembrance, echoes the findings of a survey carried out in seven European countries in November.Steven Frank, who was one of only 93 children to survive the Theresienstadt camp, said: “I find these figures terribly worrying. In my experience, people don’t have a solid understanding of what happened during the Holocaust and that’s one reason I’m so committed to sharing what happened to me.“At one of my talks, I met someone who said the Holocaust didn’t happen. The only way to fight this kind of denial and antisemitism is with the truth – I tell people what happened, what I saw and experienced. If we ignore the past, I fear history will repeat itself.”Education was vital in the fight against ignorance and hate, said Karen Pollock of the Holocaust Educational Trust. “One person questioning the truth of the Holocaust is one too many, and so it is up to us to redouble our efforts to ensure future generations know that it did happen and become witnesses to one of the darkest episodes in our history.”Holocaust Memorial Day will be marked by a national commemorative event in central London on Sunday, attended by senior politicians, faith leaders and survivors. More than 11,000 activities and events are planned across the UK.Yesterday Rachel Riley, the Countdown presenter, said she was to be given extra security on the show after receiving online abuse over her comments on antisemitism in the Labour party.

Well, I’ve been attacked by people on the left and the best way to not have me talk about antisemitism on the left is not to be antisemitic.”The remembrance day will also mark the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, which began in April 1994, and 40th anniversary of the Cambodia genocide’s end. Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, said: “As each year the number of Holocaust survivors able to share their personal testimony diminishes, our responsibility to honour their experience, to educate the uninitiated grows ever greater if we are to ensure that Jews can live as safely as all other European citizens.“On 27 January, the world will unite to remember all the victims of the Holocaust – let their voices give us the call to action we need to work together, united, to ensure the future of the Europe we know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b25e5c68877b389a89f80234a539a128bb788e8a/0_11_2770_1661/master/2770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bfe86794da0c416d390007b19dd0d53","title":"south african intelligence officers spread aids black communities","story":"A South Africa-based mercenary group has been accused by one of its former members of trying to intentionally spread Aids in southern Africa in the 1980s and 1990s.The claims are made by Alexander Jones in a documentary that premieres this weekend at the Sundance film festival. He says he spent years as an intelligence officer with the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), three decades ago, when it was masterminding coups and other violence across Africa.The film also explores the unexplained murder of a young SAIMR recruit in 1990, whose family believe was killed because of her work on an Aids-related project run by the group in South Africa and Mozambique.And it also claims the group’s then leader had a racist, apocalyptic obsession with HIVAids. Keith Maxwell wrote about a plague he hoped would decimate black populations, cement white rule, and bring back conservative religious mores, according to papers collected by the film-makers.Maxwell had no medical qualifications but ran clinics in poor, mostly black areas around Johannesburg while claiming to be a doctor. That gave him the opportunity for sinister experimentation, Jones says in the film, Cold Case Hammarskjöld. The film-makers were investigating SAIMR because it claimed responsibility for the mysterious 1961 plane crash that killed Dag Hammarskjöld, then UN secretary general.Any interest Maxwell showed in Aids in public was benevolent. Claude Newbury, an anti-abortion doctor who knew the mercenary leader, confirmed he had no medical qualifications but described a committed humanitarian. “He was against genocide and he was trying to discover a cure for HIV,” Newbury told film-makers.A bizarre Johannesburg Sunday Times interview with teenage SAIMR “ensign” Debbie Campbell in August 1989 has a photo of a teenager with a halo of curls, taking water pollution measurements and also talking about searching for a cure for HIVAids. But the wholesome image has a sinister undertone. She describes being recruited out of school at 13, and it’s hard to imagine any benign interest an international mercenary group could have in signing up prepubescent girls.The papers read like the fever dream of a man who aspired to be South Africa’s Josef Mengele. There are detailed, if sometimes garbled, accounts of how he thought the HIV virus could be isolated, propagated and used to target black Africans.What is less clear is whether he had the expertise or funds to implement his nightmarish visions. Jones, the former SAIMR member, claims he did. “We were involved in Mozambique, spreading the Aids virus through medical conditions,” he says.At least one other SAIMR member had apparently raised concerns about the group’s medical programmes. Dagmar Feil was a marine biologist who was recruited by her boyfriend. In 1990 she was murdered outside her home in Johannesburg her relatives believe the killing was linked to her work on SAIMR’s Aids programme.“My sister came to me, and she said she needed to confide in me,” her brother Karl Feil told the film-makers. “She sat with me and said she thinks they are going to kill her.” She said that three or four others in her team had already been murdered, but when asked what team, Dagmar said “she couldn’t tell me”.“The topic of Aids research came up several times, quite loosely in conversations, I never put two and two together,” Feil says in the film. Instead Dagmar asked Karl to go with her to church, so she could “make right with God”. Weeks later she was dead.Jones says he knew Dagmar Feil and claims her death came after a trip to Mozambique, which he describes as a base for the group’s medical experimentation. “She was recruited to do medical research,” he says. “She progressed and she became part of the inner circle for operations. She went to Mozambique to fulfil her obligations and … word got out that she was going to testify.”Feil’s family spent years trying to find out what happened to her, but police showed little interest, her brother says. During that time, the family say another SAIMR member gave them papers believed to be Maxwell’s memoir and his account of SAIMR. They later shared these with the film-makers.Dagmar Feil’s mother also went to South Africa’s truth and reconciliation commission several times, Karl Feil said. She asked it to investigate her daughter’s killing as part of a wider conspiracy, but was turned away.Although the commission first revealed the existence of SAIMR to the world, the team was also overworked and had to deal with false confessions, and what the family saw as their best hope of uncovering the truth slipped away. “They would not listen to her,” Karl Feil says. “They would not debate this issue at all.”Andreas Rocksen co-produced and Mads Brügger directed Cold Case Hammarskjöld.

Bologna experimented with free transport in the 1970s, when it was ruled by the Communist party.By 2000, there were 27 free public systems in the world. That increased to 60 in 2010, 99 in 2017 and 114 today, the majority in Europe, says Wojciech Keblowski, an expert on free public transport at the Free University Brussels.So does this mean free public transport is the wave of the future? The answer depends on the size and sociology of the city, and the existing network. Free transport has been a resounding success in, among others, Tallinn, Estonia, and Dunkirk, northern France.After studying Dunkirk’s example, Paris decided on January 10th to expand its tiered fare system, rather than abolish fares altogether.James Wickham, a retired professor in sociology at Trinity College Dublin and author of Gridlock: Dublin’s Transport Crisis and the Future of the City, says the question is largely irrelevant to the Irish capital.“The big issue in Dublin is not to get people on to existing public transport, but to create a lot more public transport,” he says.“It is very clear that the success or failure of a system depends highly on context,” says Keblowski.“The way it is done, the reasons why it is done. The absolute key thing is that there be strong political will behind it.”Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo raised the possibility of a full free-fare public system last March, when she was under fire for bungling changes to the city’s Vélib bicycle system. Hidalgo’s deputies spent nine months drawing up a report that concluded free transport would not work for the French capital.Paris could not accommodate a projected increase in public transport use, from 36 per cent to 48 per cent of all journeys, if the already saturated system was offered free of charge, the report said. Car traffic would have decreased only marginally, simulations showed.Public transport in Paris and the surrounding Ile-de-France region costs €10.1 billion annually. An exceptionally high percentage, 27.1 per cent, is financed by fares. In Dunkirk, which went fare-free last September, only 10 per cent of costs were paid by users.Discord between Hidalgo, a Socialist, and Valérie Pécresse, the conservative president of the Ile-de-France region surrounding Paris, also worked against a free-fare system. Pécresse’s constituency relies heavily on cars. Hidalgo has infuriated motorists by eliminating parking spaces, closing the banks of the Seine to traffic and other measures intended to discourage car use.Hidalgo instead adopted 23 measures which will cost the city €5 million annually. The most publicised will provide free transport for children under the age of 11.To create a free system, Paris would have had to spend a great deal more on public transport, and much less on car infrastructure, says Keblowski. “Maintaining fares is a way of keeping the system stable, of not radically changing priorities for transport infrastructure.”Contrary to what one might think, the main benefits of free public transport are sociological, not environmental.Helping the underprivileged is the most powerful argument in its favour. “Use among vulnerable groups – the unemployed, the elderly and youths who do not have a middle-class income – increases dramatically when fares are abolished,” Keblowski says.“The city becomes much more available to them. They can look for jobs and take advantage of cultural activities and institutions. That argument is especially present in the French context.”In Aubagne, a suburb of Marseille where Keblowski conducted research, “there is a clear danger of ghettoisation, of locking people in neighbourhoods from which it is difficult to escape. In such cities, free public transport is a social policy that redistributes access to the city . . . The challenge is to be socially sensitive to the effect of policies, so we don’t end up with cities that are green and environmentally friendly, but essentially middle-class enclaves surrounded by the working class living in car-oriented suburbs.”Patrice Vergriete, the mayor of Dunkirk, previously ran an urban planning agency. In his 2014 campaign, he promised to make all bus lines free in the city of 200,000.“Dunkirk was razed in the second World War. You probably saw the movie,” Vergriete says. “It was rebuilt for cars, which were used by the vast majority of people. It had become an environmental problem, not only for air quality. A quarter of the city centre was parking lots, which meant less space for housing.”Vergriete, a former Socialist, wanted to increase the purchasing power of Dunkirk’s citizens. “City taxes are mainly property taxes, so if you lower them, the property owners benefit. Making the bus free was a way of lowering tax for the elderly, for youths and the disadvantaged. It enabled everyone to move around the city freely, which fights social exclusion and the isolation of the elderly. We have far fewer shut-ins.”Finally, Vergriete says, he wanted to create a “psychological shock” that would push people towards the bus system. “If you don’t do that, people won’t change their habits and they keep their cars. Free public transport was a shock. Five months later, people are still talking about it in Dunkirk.”Vergriete knew it was important to improve the quality of the system before making it free. He expanded the bus fleet from 100 to 140 and banned parking downtown. He had city buses painted bright pink, orange, green, yellow and blue, with matching seats. Some run on environmentally friendly natural gas.“We want people to see them. We are proud of them,” he says. Buses pass every 10 minutes. Some provide free wifi and entertainment.“We want to make buses a place of conviviality,” the mayor continues. “People used to talk to each other in cafes. The buses have become like cafes in the old days, the place where people meet and talk to each other.”Bus usage has increased by 50 to 85 per cent. Vergriete disputes studies that claim free transport draws more pedestrians and cyclists than motorists. Fewer than 1 per cent of journeys in Dunkirk were made by bicycle.Though statistics will not be available until June, Vergriete expects them to show a high percentage of motorists have switched to buses, and substantially increased mobility among Dunkirk’s citizens.To finance free transport, Dunkirk has increased its transport budget by €15 million, to €35 million. That is 55 per cent financed by the versement transport charged of all businesses employing more than 11 people, and 45 per cent by the city itself.Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States have a different attitude towards public transport, Vergriete notes. “Public transport is a fundamental right, like health and education. The Anglo-Saxons have a liberal vision, which says users should pay for the system. I have no problem with the user not paying. If a person is mobile, pollutes less, does not take up parking space and has greater purchasing power, surely that is for the common good?”Wickham, the retired sociology professor from TCD, agrees with Vergriete. “In many ways, Ireland is more Anglo-Saxon than the British,” he says. “We don’t have a national health service . . . Transport is a public service. You have to subsidise it.”Wickham has piles of documents on the shelves of his study, going back 20 years. “They show all sorts of lovely lines on maps for metros and Luas extensions, virtually none of which has happened.”It goes back to Keblowski’s point about strong political will. “We have a ceremonial mayor for Dublin city,” Wickham says. “If you want proper public transport in a city, a powerful political authority is an essential condition.”The National Transport Authority has a legal duty to “consider” strategy for Dublin, Wickham notes. “But it has no responsibility to any elected body in Dublin. Most big, successful cities have something that looks like a transport authority, whose experts answer to a mayor or an assembly.”Dublin’s transport needs are so great, the city so sprawled, that priority must be given to “tying bits of the city together”, Wickham says.“We have what academics call constrained car dependency, which means you cannot move around unless you have a car, so you have to buy a car.”All the bus routes into the city are radial, Wickham says. “But studies show most journeys are from one suburb to another. You need some orbital routes, for example, a bus that went around the North Circular and down the South Circular, would be dead cheap. Make that one free. That would be absolutely brilliant.”Ireland already provides free public transport for citizens aged 67 and older, and for certain categories of welfare recipients. Free transport is irrelevant for greater Dublin, Wickham argues, but he makes an exception for the city centre, “between the canals . . . It would be largely used by tourists, and would prevent them clogging up at the Book of Kells and Dublin Castle.“Free public transport financed explicitly by a tourist tax on Airbnb’s and hotels within the canals makes sense.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3772098.1548515434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nationalists looking at new constitutional horizons belfast conference hears","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeputy leader of Fianna Fail Dara Calleary (left), Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald (second left), SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Minister for Education Joe McHugh (right) at today’s conference in Belfast. Photograph: Brian LawlessPABrexit has changed everything leading to a current “seismic shift” within nationalism, one of the main organisers of a “civic nationalism” conference stated at the Belfast Waterfront Hall on Saturday.Up to 1,500 people who are attending the “Beyond Brexit – The Future or Ireland” conference heard Belfast solicitor Niall Murphy say that nationalists in Northern Ireland were now “looking to new constitutional and political horizons”.“We are looking towards the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement and its recognition of the absolute legitimacy and validity to aspire towards Irish unity,” he told the large gathering.Mr Murphy was fiercely critical of the DUP and others in political unionism who, he said, had “blocked the development of a shared, secular society based on rights, civil liberties and anti-sectarianism.He complained about the “DUP’s sneering contempt for parity of esteem”, and its “sneering contempt” for an Irish language act as well as its opposition to same sex-marriage legislation.“Our language is an intrinsic part of all of our identity as citizens, yet we endure contemptuous taunts, such as Curry My Yoghurt and Crocodiles and the cancellation of microscopic bursaries for the Donegal Gaeltacht,” he said.Mr Murphy said “Brexit has changed everything” and “old certainties have gone”. “Most significantly, between December 2017 and November 2018, the nationalist discontent to which we gave popular expression has not only grown, in fact a seismic shift has occurred within wider nationalist opinion,” he said.And referring to how Sinn Féin does not take its House of Commons seats Mr Murphy added: “Having turned its back on Westminster in June 2017, nationalism is now looking beyond the parameters of what was the Northern state.”Mr Murphy, who described Northern Ireland as a “micro jurisdiction” said “conversations about the future, and future constitutional change, are happening in unexpected places”.“Every single citizen in the North, and beyond, is entitled to civil and religious liberties, equality, parity of esteem and to live free from sectarian discrimination or attack and all forms of bigotry and intolerance,” he added.Speakers at the conference include the Minister for Education Joe McHugh, the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Fianna Fail TD Dara Calleary.One of the early speakers at the morning session was Mr McHugh who said that “getting power-sharing up and running and working well is the best first step that can be taken by those who wish to advocate for a united Ireland”.“Letting the institutions drift on in a state of suspended animation is a path that leads only to further polarisation and dysfunction — and that is why the Government is completely focussed on helping to get them working again,” he said.Mr McHugh reiterated Dublin’s commitment to the Belfast Agreement principle of consent where any change in the status of Northern Ireland only can happen through a Border poll and a vote of the majority of the people in the North.“The Irish Government believes that a border poll in the current climate would be unsuccessful and would only succeed in creating further ision,” he said.Referring to last Saturday’s New IRA car bombing in Derry Mr McHugh said it was “vital that everyone in the community support the police in bringing the perpetrators of this attack to justice”. To applause he said: “I would say to whoever was behind those events: you are not acting on behalf of the Irish people. You represent nothing but conflict and fear and destruction, and you will not succeed in dragging us all back into the dark days of the past.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: CCTV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnti-Maduro demonstrators gather as one holds a poster of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido in Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Mario TamaGetty ImagesThe United States on Saturday called on the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro’s government, while European powers signalled they were set to follow Washington in recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s rightful leader.In heated back-and-forth exchanges at a United Nations Security Council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela’s oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup, and lambasted Europeans’ demand that elections be called within eight days.Mr Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on January 5th, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The United States, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognised the young leader in quick succession. Mr Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down.But on Saturday Nr Guaido (35) gained support from a key military official. Venezuela’s defence attache to Washington, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, told Reuters that he has broken with the Maduro government and recognized Mr Guaido as interim president.Speaking at the UN meeting, called by the United States, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Mr Maduro’s “socialist experiment” had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary Venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food.“Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side . . . Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Mr Pompeo told the council. “We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela’s democratic transition and interim president Guaido’s role.”Mr Pompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Mr Maduro’s government. Washington has signalled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Mr Maduro from power, but on Saturday Mr Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans.By overcoming opposition to holding the UN meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said.Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognise Mr Guaido if Mr Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister called “childlike.”“Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?” Venezuelan foreign minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council.Russia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with US president Donald Trump’s government was still on the table despite his administration’s two-year campaign against Mr Maduro.“If president Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won’t get that war in Venezuela,” Mr Arreaza told reporters later.Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Mr Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million per cent this year.Mr Maduro cruised to re-election last May. The opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part. Critics accused the government of vote-buying. The domestic opposition, the United States and right-leaning Latin American governments declined to recognise the result of the ballot.Venezuelan opposition sympathisers had been urging Mr Guaido to assume the presidency since Mr Maduro was inaugurated for a second term on January 10th. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Caracas earlier this week, calling on Mr Maduro to step down.Mr Guaido’s declaration of himself as the interim president takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognized abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions.After the Security Council debate, Mr Guaido sent a letter to secretary general Antonio Guterres asking the United Nations for help addressing hunger, violence and the lack of medicines in his country.The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.Mr Guaido celebrated the support of European countries and also asked them to send humanitarian aid to help relieve the economic crisis. “We woke up today with nothing less than the full support of the European community,” Mr Guaido said at a small political event in a square in the capital Caracas.“Several European countries have been in touch with us and are going to support the entry of humanitarian aid . . . We continue adding countries to this great effort,” he said.The Maduro government has previously rejected such aid, denying there is a humanitarian crisis in the country and blaming economic problems on sanctions.After Washington’s declaration of support for Mr Guaido, Mr Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with the United States on Wednesday and gave US diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.Some US embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statementHowever, Mr Maduro softened his demand that all US embassy staff withdraw by Saturday.Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with “Interest Offices” in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. If that fails, the missions would close.–Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added.

He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Six commercial operators added their voice.The hearings on the new bylaw are set for August 2019. In the meantime, there are no rules.Limiting Airbnb to some version of its initial ideal of “home sharing” is crucial.In 2018, 16 per cent of Toronto Airbnb hosts controlled 38 per cent of the listings, and the problem is worsening, with some downtown condos having hundreds of units listed on Airbnb, according to the Fairbnb report. The study concludes that Airbnb is responsible for countless illegal “ghost hotels”.What’s more, the report notes that if Toronto’s new rules were to come\u0026nbspinto force, more than 8,200 listings would have to be removed, and up to 6,500 whole homes would be available to boost the supply of\u0026nbsplong-term family rental housing.Toronto’s inability to set and enforce policy is not unusual. Some cities, especially in Europe, place a limit of\u0026nbsp90 days per year\u0026nbspon such rentals (Toronto’s limit is 180 days).Usually, licensing is also required.\u0026nbspThere’s also a municipal tax in some cities, similar to a hotel room tax. Licences vary in price — some are as expensive as taxi licences in the pre-Uber days and some are much cheaper.But licensing is essential for any regulation to work. Cities can only police the illegal use of properties if the name of the owner and their address and contact details are in a city database.Barcelona and Berlin have set up\u0026nbspserious regulatory systems\u0026nbspthat begin, as they must, by collecting data about the host and can result in fines of half a million euros.The top Airbnb holiday homes to book for 2019Israel threatens to slap high taxes on Airbnb after settlements banAirbnb to remove listings in Israel’s West Bank settlementsCouple’s LA holiday ruined when Airbnb ‘superhost’ attacks themShocked couple find hidden camera in AirbnbThat decision may be overruled, since all types of licences require a public body to collect and store information about the licensee. But in the meantime, the city of New York has had its hands tied as it tries to limit the negative impact of Airbnb on housing availability and prices.So if cities are having trouble limiting the undesirable effects of short-term rentals, who else could help?In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, the obvious answer is condo boards. Unlike cities, condo boards can force homeowners to put up curtains or blinds of a specific colour, never mind outlawing Airbnb rentals. However, bans are not easily enforced in large buildings with many absentee unit owners.And new condo buildings in Toronto are a particular problem. They usually come with a founding bylaw that allows short-term rentals. A bylaw is not like a rule about curtain colours: It can only be changed by a supermajority of 80 per cent or even 90 per cent of owners. It only takes a few folks renting on Airbnb to\u0026nbspfoil their neighbours.After researching the toothless regulations Canadian cities have placed on Uber, I concluded that municipal licensing bodies are not suited to limiting the economic and social damage\u0026nbspcaused by what I call “cowboy e-capitalism.” My chapter\u0026nbspin the book\u0026nbspLaw and the “Sharing Economy”\u0026nbspdelves into the issue.Cities have neither the legal powers nor the enforcement capacity needed to regulate transnational giants.\u0026nbspRedefining “ride-sharing” as a public utility, thus making it a state responsibility, is what allowed California to put rules in place that protect Uber drivers while promoting the public interest.Similarly, in Canada and elsewhere, Airbnb has been seen as a problem for municipal licensing bodies. But the threat it poses is to housing, which is a fundamental issue for higher levels of government.In Canada, cities could do more,\u0026nbspas Barcelona is doing.But given how difficult it has proved for municipalities all over the world to try to regulate this powerful transnational company, it is time for citizens to demand that provincial governments take their housing policy seriously and use their considerable planning powers to limit short-term rentals.Mariana Valverde is an urban law and governnace infrastructure researcher and professor of socio-legal studies at the University of Toronto.

During the last global recession there was a failure among world leaders to coordinate a global fiscal response of sufficient proportions, which meant the world’s major central banks had to do the heavy lifting with extraordinary monetary policies, in the form of record low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE).\u0026nbspQE involved central banks creating\u0026nbsp trillions of dollars worth of new money ‘out of thin air’ to buy up assets from the financial sector. This flow of new money into financial markets had the effect of re-inflating asset prices, which had collapsed during the financial crisis, and increasing liquidity in order to get banks lending again.\u0026nbspThe problem was that rather than using this new money to lend productively, banks predominantly stuck to the easy-profit route of bidding up property prices. In an ultra-low interest rate environment financial firms have also engaged in ever-riskier lending in the pursuit of higher yields. The result is reinflated asset bubbles and collateralised loan obligations to over-indebted companies, which echo the subprime lending behind the last crisis.QE also had dramatic implications for inequality. All of this new money flooding into financial markets pushed up asset prices, meaning a big payoff for their wealthy owners. The Bank of England, which has created £445bn through QE, estimates that its policies made the top 10 per cent\u0026nbspof households wealthier by £350,000 each. Meanwhile, the asset-poor were left with little more than the fairytale of trickle down economics.The billionaires of Davos are a painful symptom of inequalityThe rise of ‘pauper’s funerals’ is a sad reminder of UK inequalityBoE should wind down its balance sheet early, says Ian McCaffertyGeorge Osborne says the Bank of England\u0027s QE makes the rich richerAll this is not to say that central bankers should have kept their hands clean. Central banks were forced to ramp up monetary policy as politicians shied away from their responsibilities to manage the economy with appropriate fiscal policy, instead opting to counter-intuitively cut for growth\u0026nbspthrough austerity. With central bankers limited by time and by mandate, the first round of QE can be seen as a ‘necessary evil’ - doing nothing would have only deepened the recession.But there should be no such excuses when the next downturn arrives. Further attempts to stimulate the economy through QE-fuelled asset price inflation will have diminishing returns, only creating more bubbles and further widening inequality.A sustainable recovery will only come from policies which stimulate demand in the real economy. This is something which QE could be redesigned for.Central banks’ power to create new money, as demonstrated by QE, is a powerful tool that must be put to much better uses.\u0026nbspThis is an idea which has been put on the table in the UK. In the US rising Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and in France Nicolas Hulot, who resigned from Macron’s government, are also displaying the bold thinking required with their calls for a Green New Deal a massive programme of spending on green jobs and infrastructure, which could be financed by central bank money creation.But Green New Deals and other alternatives to QE will be most effective if there is an element of coordination between countries. Firstly, on a technical level, for any country other than the United States, creating vast sums of new money while foreign central banks keep a tight monetary policy could lead to unwanted pressure on their currency.But perhaps more importantly, the problems facing humanity, from climate change to spectacular inequality, are not limited to one country and cannot be solved by one country alone.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceThe figures follow research from Lloyds Bank which showed that UK firms ramped up stockpiling in the final quarter of last year. The bank said the increase in stockpiling efforts was caused by the threat of shortages and disruption posed by Brexit. UK Finance also released data on household lending and spending in 2018. Credit card spending rose to £11bn in December, up 8.8 per cent on the same month in 2017.Eric Leenders, the trade group’s managing director for personal finance, said this rise in spending was “largely offset by increased cardholder repayments, with almost half of cards not bearing any interest at all”. “This reflects the growing trend of consumers using credit cards as a preferred payment method rather than as a means of borrowing, in order to take advantage of additional protections and value-added benefits,” he added.

He also warned that “the recovery in mortgage approvals once Brexit uncertainty has faded likely will be lacklustre”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently WhatsApp users are not required to provide their name or any other identifying information beyond their phone number to use the messaging app.Merging with Facebook Messenger and Instagram could force WhatsApp users to reveal information about themselves that they would prefer to keep private.Data privacy expert Tim Mackey, who works at the software firm Synopsys, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat Facebook should take considerable care in how the integration ws handled given the firm\u0027s spotty history with user privacy.Merging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won’t be trivial, he said. Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy.With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That hasn\u0027t ever been possible before.At the moment, the three are entirely separate. Though they are all developed by the same company, and so share some data between themselves and work together, they are in practise three different apps that can\u0027t talk to each other.But this state of affairs has been gradually changing, even before this news. WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For Diane Abbott, a politician with extensive media experience, the show was a “horrible experience”, the worst of her many appearances on the programme. Having appeared on something like 30 episodes, that’s significant. After all, some of her early experiences were almost as eventful. \u0026nbspHer appearance on Question Time in July 1987 was particularly memorable. Abbott shared a panel with Liberal MP Cyril Smith and Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, with Robin Day in the chair. Then, as now, it was the discussion of opinion polls that caused uproar. The polls, Smith commented forcefully, showed that Labour was unelectable, “and one of the reasons for it,”\u0026nbsphe added, “is Diane Abbott and people like her...”\u0026nbspThe largely white audience applauded, and after a moment’s delay chuckled, seeming to get some unspoken joke. Abbott called him out:\u0026nbsp“If Mr Smith believes that having black people in parliament for the first time is in some sense a backward step, thousands of people that voted for me in Hackney North would disagree.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe response was immediate. For Heseltine this was beyond the pale. He appealed to Day to intervene. The audience protested vocally. “I honestly believe,”\u0026nbspsaid one white man, “that the vast majority of the audience here do not see Diane as a black person.”\u0026nbspThis went down well, as did his thought that Abbott was the panellist showing true prejudice for assuming that white people perceived race. Day wrapped up the discussion apologising to the audience for calling Abbott black, his implication being that unless he had said so, none of the white people in the crowd would have been able to tell.The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgraceThe 1987 episode exposes the nature of the assumptions of many white Britons about race in Thatcher’s Britain. Britain was, as Heseltine put it, a harmonious and tolerant country, white people were effectively “colourblind”, and black people who claimed otherwise were either deluded or harbouring their own anti-white prejudice.In the same way, last week’s Question Time says something important about the nature of our politics, its entrenched biases, and which political figures are taken seriously.Evidence of bias on the show is best illustrated through comparison. Abbott was interrupted twice as often as prisons minister Rory Stewart, even though Stewart spoke more often, and for more of the show. The introductions at the top of the show were far from even-handed. Stewart’s introduction covered his ministerial career, past and present, as well as his governorships in Iraq.For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weightBy comparison, Abbott’s introduction was short on detail. What is more, by linking her position as shadow home secretary to her relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, there was an implication that Abbott owed her job to a personal relationship, rather than merit. Indeed, according to several audience members, this was precisely the point made by Fiona Bruce before the show. Equally, in introducing Abbott, Bruce failed to mention her time as shadow minister for public health, her years on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the Treasury Select Committee, nor did she mention that Abbott is the first black woman to be elected to the Commons.Then there was Bruce’s decision to side with journalist Isabel Oakeshott’s wholly inaccurate statement that Labour was “way behind... miles behind” in the polls. At the same time, she was quick to assure the audience that Abbott was “definitely” wrong in her contention that the two main parties were essentially “level pegging”. In reality, as the BBC has subsequently acknowledged, Abbott was correct.Although this was never said explicitly, the constant interruptions (21 times compared to nine interruptions of Stewart and eight of the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman), the minimisation of Abbott’s achievements, the willingness to “correct” Abbott when she was in the right, all indicate that in some important sense, Abbott was out of place. For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weight:\u0026nbspin short, she was not treated as a serious political figure.Why not? Abbott’s treatment is perplexing. In some ways, her biography is similar to many of our political leaders. Educated at an elite university, she went on to have a career in Whitehall, then the media, and then parliament. But the fact that Abbott is a black woman, from a working-class family gives each stage of this story a different significance.She won her place at Cambridge in 1973, at a time when only 10 per cent of the university’s students were women. While the university did not collect data on student ethnicity at the time, recent research shows that she was the second black person to study at Newnham in its century-long history, and only the third black person to study history at Cambridge in the 750 years since the university’s foundation.For politicians such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, success in university politics was part of their path to Westminster. Not so for Abbott, who had little time for college debating societies. Her antipathy to university politics is easy to explain. Enoch Powell was honorary president of the university’s Conservative Society when Abbott started at Cambridge, and women were excluded from many of Cambridge’s student societies. But more than that, Abbott found the concerns of student politics essentially elitist.Abbott’s path from university to parliament was anything but straightforward. She entered the Commons in 1987, at a time when there were no black people in the house, at a time when fewer than 5 per cent of MPs were women, and at a time when there was widespread suspicion of black radicalism. Abbott’s historic success was the result of a decade of activism, working with black organisations, and within the Labour Party.Accusing the BBC of bias over Diane Abbott is a step too farDiane Abbott rejects BBC response to Question Time rowLabour demands BBC footage and apology amid Abbott Question Time rowDiane Abbott accuses BBC of anti-Corbyn bias in stinging attackDiane Abbott accuses Question Time of legitimising ‘bias and abuse’In 1978 Abbott became involved with the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), an umbrella organisation for black and Asian women’s groups. Founded by radicals including Stella Dadzie and Olive Morris, Abbott believed that the black womanism she encountered at OWAAD was far more sophisticated and rooted in the concerns of working-class black women\u0026nbspthan the student politics she had experienced at Cambridge. \u0026nbspIn 1983 Labour politics and black radicalism came together. Together with Russell Proffit, Elaine Foster, Marc Wadsworth\u0026nbspand others, Abbott founded the Labour Party Black Sections movement, which fought for black representation at all levels of the party, with a view to gaining black representation at all levels of government. Black Sections was\u0026nbspextraordinarily controversial. The right-wing press dubbed Abbott, Paul Boateng, Linda Bellos, Bernie Grant, Sharon Atkin and other LPBS activists “Black Extremists”, “Black Militants” and “Loony Left”.\u0026nbspIn 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime ministerThe movement was\u0026nbspno less controversial inside the Labour Party, and in the run-up to the 1987 election, black candidates were regularly deselected –\u0026nbspthe party leadership seemed to feel that white voters would not turn out for black candidates. In spite of this apparent hostility from the party leadership, in spite of constant attacks in the media, four Black Sections candidates won seats in the 1987 election, Abbott\u0026nbsp(the only woman) among them.Since 1987, Abbott has had a distinguished parliamentary career. Her first major campaign\u0026nbspas an MP\u0026nbspwas against the imprisoning of refugees on Britain’s first private jail, the Earl William, a recently privatised and hastily repurposed car ferry. Abbott visited the Tamil refugees, many of whom had fled torture, highlighting their squalid conditions, and the absence of medical care. The Thatcher government refused to back down, even when the floating prison, nicknamed “the hulk” due to its obvious disrepair, broke its moorings and ran aground in the great storm of October 1987.In 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime minister. Abbott also played an important role in exposing evidence of government complicity in the “arms to Africa” scandal. Someone at the top of government was clearly irked by Abbott’s efforts on the Foreign Affair Select Committee, for a government dossier on Abbott was leaked, containing material stolen from her a decade earlier.Abbott’s skill as a parliamentarian was not lost on The Spectator. The venerable right-wing journal awarded her parliamentary speech of the year in 2008, for her forensic critique of Gordon Brown’s proposed anti-terror laws. Abbott stood for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and since joining the shadow cabinet she led Labour’s attack on the government over last year’s Windrush scandal.The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuffIn spite of this long, pioneering and successful career, in spite of all of her experience in parliament, and working with grassroots campaigns, Abbott was treated with derision on Question Time.Anti-politics, and a generalised distrust of politicians is part of the current zeitgeist. Yet, even in an age of distrust some politicians are derided more than others. Privilege insulates some iniduals and groups at the expense of others. So, Oakeshott can get polling data wrong and still be taken seriously. Stewart can pull figures out of the air, and still expect to be treated with respect. But as a black woman, Abbott is routinely ridiculed, and her infrequent gaffs are seized upon as “proof”\u0026nbspthat she has no right to be at the centre of British politics.Boris Johnson is, perhaps the best example of a British politician insulated by privilege. As an exceptionally wealthy, white man he can get away with accusing the Turkish president of having sex with a goat he can brush off criticism following his use of the word “piccaninnies” he was even able to accuse Barack Obama of “ancestral dislike” of Britain, and still be given the job of foreign secretary – one of the highest offices of state.None of this is without personal consequences for Abbott, who experiences more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics. “Twitter has put racists into overdrive,” Abbott remarked in response to research published by Amnesty International in December 2018. The research showed that black women in journalism and politics were 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. “The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuff,” she said.\u0026nbspAn earlier study by Amnesty of 900,223 tweets sent in the six months before the 2017 election\u0026nbsprevealed that Abbott received 45 per cent of all abusive tweets sent to women MPs, 10 times more than other women in parliament. According to Abbott: “It’s highly racialised and it’s also gendered because people talk about rape and they talk about my physical appearance in a way they wouldn’t talk about a man. I’m abused as a female politician and I’m abused as a black politician.”During the 2016 US election, Trump claimed infamously\u0026nbspthat he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters. He was so insulated by his status that “his people” would still support him, even if he was guilty of murder. Sadly, as last week’s Question Time shows, a similar relationship between privilege and bias is at work in British politics.Robin Bunce is a historian based at Homerton College, University of Cambridge Paul Field is a lawyer, writer and human rights activistOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Perhaps, but it would be unwise to read too much into it.Markets\u0026nbspmight simply be wrong about the likely outcome.\u0026nbspWe often talk about markets as if they are definable, tangible entities but in reality they are huge numbers of companies, investors, traders and brokers buying and selling to each other.\u0026nbspThe price of the pound is an aggregation of millions of transactions between those participants. More sellers and the price will go down, more buyers it will go up simple supply and demand.While many of these participants have a significant financial interest in correctly predicting the movement of currency values, they frequently get things wrong.Banks spend vast sums applying statistical models and researching down to the tiniest detail in order to get an edge in currency markets.But that doesn’t necessarily mean they have any special information that allows them to predict the outcome of a political process that, it is fair to say, has been less than smooth.The report on the DUP that has helped boost the pound wasn’t special insider knowledge obtained only by financial institutions it was printed in The Sun.The Brexit referendum itself is a clear example of currency markets being a poor predictor of a political event. The pound suffered its biggest single-day plunge ever on 24 June precisely because most market participants thought the UK would vote to remain.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Michael Russell, the Scottish government\u0027s minister with responsibility for Brexit negotiations attends a Rally for Europe at Augustine United Church in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Counter-demonstrators also staged a march in London todayPeople in Santa costumes in Trafalgar Square, London, as they take part in SantaconIf they had predicted it correctly, the decline in sterling would have taken place before the vote\u0026nbspand not have been so painfully sudden.The 2016 vote was a simple binary choice on which there had been reams and reams of polling. The current political situation is anything but. It has many potential outcomes, none of which seem to be truly understood, even by some of the MPs arguing for them.On balance, have we benefited from being in the EU?The second reason not to set too much stall by\u0026nbspthe currency market as a political sage is that there are a host of other factors beyond politics that affect exchange rates.\u0026nbspInterest rates are the most obvious and closely correlated. A higher return\u0026nbspattracts foreign investment, pushing\u0026nbspup demand for the pound and therefore the price.Which leads to a related point: currencies are always priced in pairs. Pound v dollar, euro v ruble etc.So if demand for the other currency in that pair increases, the pound will suffer a relative decline.On Friday, the pound rose 0.7 per cent against the dollar but fell slightly against the euro. Events in Europe had strengthened the single currency, events that had nothing to do with the Brexit saga.\u0026nbspWhile it would be nice to have a handy index illuminating the road ahead, the value of the pound is only of marginal use in this regard.In other words, when it comes to Brexit, it’s still anybody’s guess.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The objects that are part of the collection of the British Museum are in the fiduciary ownership of the Trustees of the Museum.”Defenders of keeping the statues in Britain have argued returning them would pave the way for requests from other coutries for items in British museums to be returned.In a statement, the British Museum said: “Hartwig Fischer was stating the long-standing position of the British Museum. We believe there is a great public benefit in being able to see these wonderful objects in the context of a world collection.“The museum lends extensively across the world, and some loans are long-term but not indefinite.”Polling by YouGov conducted in 2017 suggested the British public mostly back the marbles’ return, with 55 per cent saying the statues should go back to Greece and\u0026nbsp21 per cent saying they should remain in Britain.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

three separate attempts to\u0026nbspredraft leader’s strategy so it\u0026nbspties party unambiguously to giving UK a second voteClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Corbyn faces a revolt from Labour MPs backing a new Brexit referendum, who will launch a drive to rewrite his proposals for the next phase of withdrawal.The move from three MPs to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a Final Say referendum, once again thrusts the party’s deep Brexit isions into the spotlight.Hours earlier four other Labour MPs had joined Tory counterparts at a press conference, with one accusing Mr Corbyn of “standing in the way” of a people’s vote.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhile Mr Corbyn’s office declined to comment on Thursday, the leader’s social media outriders launched a counter-attack on the Labour rebels whom they accused of dishonesty.Meanwhile doubt has emerged over the viability of a cross-party push by MPs to delay the UK’s withdrawal in order to avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March.No-deal Brexit would be ‘betrayal’ of what was promised, says HammondAnd in Davos, chancellor Philip Hammond warned that a no-deal Brexit – something Theresa May has refused to rule out – would be a “betrayal” of the 2016 referendum result, underlining the split\u0026nbspat the heart of the Conservative cabinet.On Tuesday Ms May will give a statement and table a motion setting out the next steps of her Brexit plan, but because of previous measures approved in the Commons, all MPs will also be able to table amendments containing proposals for what they think the government should do next.Mr Corbyn has already submitted the Labour Party’s amendment, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum because it failed to fully commit the party to backing one.It would require ministers\u0026nbspto find time for MPs\u0026nbsponly to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.But The Independent understands three Labour MPs – Ian Murray, Angela Smith and Mike Gapes – have now taken the unusual step of tabling amendments to their own party leader’s amendment, in a bid to remould Mr Corbyn’s approach so it backs a new vote immediately.Mr Murray’s would commit the government to holding a referendum offering a choice between a Brexit deal that guarantees “full participation in the single market”, as previously promised by Labour, and remaining in the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

opportunity to have a final say” on leaving the EU, while Ms Smith’s would see ministers legislate for a vote on “whether or not the UK should leave”.The Independent has run its own Final Say campaign to try and secure a new referendum, with more than 1.1 million people having signed the petition.While neither Mr Corbyn’s amendment, nor the three amendments to it, stand much chance of being passed in\u0026nbspthe Commons, the joint push from Labour MPs speaks to a growing frustration on the party’s backbenchers over the ambiguity of the leader’s position as the Brexit clock ticks down to 29 March.At an event on the steps of parliament earlier in the day Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Is Brexit causing hundreds of companies to leave the UK?Ford warns no-deal Brexit would cost it $800m this year, report says Jeremy Corbyn, help give the British people a Final Say over BrexitLuciana Berger\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Chuka Umunna, who was also at the event, argued that party politics should take a back seat, saying: “The choice is stark and there is no way of escaping from it or postponing making a decision because we are out of time – do you want to facilitate some form of Brexit or give people the power to stop it?”\u0026nbspMeanwhile,\u0026nbspChris Leslie told The Independent: “There really isn’t any excuse now for Labour not fulfilling the conference promise for a people’s vote. An election hasn’t been triggered, so we should be at that stage now.”Polling indicates Labour voters and members are in favour of a new vote, but the leadership has had to walk a fine line with many constituencies in heartland areas having heavily backed Brexit.A separate group of Labour MPs strongly oppose a new referendum, including frontbencher Melanie Onn, who wrote to her constituents saying she would quit her role in Mr Corbyn’s top team if the leadership did back a new vote.Following the event in the morning Corbyn-backing commentator Paul Mason said the intervention was “daft”, and accused the Labour rebels of “preparing a doomed centrist party”.Columnist Owen Jones argued that a second referendum amendment would not get through because Labour MPs in Leave seats and Tory MPs would oppose it.He added, addressing Mr Umunna on Twitter: “You either don’t know the facts or you’re being dishonest. Which is it?”The amendment that seems most likely to get thorough the Commons on Tuesday is that written by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, with cross-party backing, that seeks to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario.But concerns have emerged that legislation it requires to enact its aim\u0026nbspcould get bogged down and even blocked outright in the House of Lords.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No deal would not be a good outcome.”But he went on: “But, it is important that it remains as a possibility because, on the other hand... some people are trying to thwart Brexit altogether.”No-deal Brexit will compromise ‘last line of defence’ for UK habitatsOn the controversial backstop proposals – to come into play if the UK cannot agree a future trade deal with the EU by December 2020, potentially locking Britain into an indefinite customs union – Mr Hinds said there are reasons to believe it would never happen.“And, even if it did, actually there are some advantages to the backstop as well as drawbacks,” he added.Asked if the government supported a time limit to the backstop – something set to be demanded by Tory MPs and Ms May’s DUP backers on Tuesday – he said it was not “entirely in the gift” of the government.In an article for the Sunday Times, Ms Leadsom accused some MPs of using attempts to take no deal off the table in order to stop Brexit altogether.She wrote: “I’m usually the last person to agree with anything that Michel Barnier says, but this week I was surprised to find common ground with him.“He made clear that opposition to a no-deal Brexit will not stop it from happening in March.“Taking no deal off the table has been used as a thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit — which conveniently overlooks the simple fact that no deal is the legal default, and that the best and most responsible way to avoid it is by voting for a deal.”She targeted criticism at MPs attempting to temporarily rewrite standing orders of parliament in order to allow themselves to bring forward legislation to vote on instead of the government, effectively stripping Ms May of some executive power.The minister asked: “When government sets a policy and legislative agenda, parliament scrutinises and holds it to account. In a world where parliament itself is setting that agenda, who scrutinises and holds parliament to account?”Labour MP Yvette Cooper said she was not seeking to “block Brexit” with her amendment and said she was not yet sure if she had the backing of Mr Corbyn.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

protests in CaracasSupporters celebrate Juan Guaido declaration that he is Venezuelan president On his fact-finding mission to the country in late 2017, he found internal overdependence on oil, poor governance and corruption had hit the Venezuelan economy hard, but said “economic warfare” practised by the US, EU and Canada are significant factors in the economic crisis.In the report, Mr de Zayas recommended, among other actions, that the International Criminal Court investigate economic sanctions against Venezuela as possible crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute.The US sanctions are illegal under international law because they were not endorsed by the UN Security Council, Mr de Zayas, an expert on international law and a former senior lawyer with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said.“Modern-day economic sanctions and blockades are comparable with medieval sieges of towns.“Twenty-first century sanctions attempt to bring not just a town, but sovereign countries to their knees,” Mr de Zayas said in his report.The US Treasury has not responded to a request for comment on Mr de Zayas’s allegations of the effects of the sanctions programme.US sanctions prohibit dealing in currencies issued by the Venezuelan government. They also target iniduals, and stop US-based companies or people from buying and selling new debt issued by PDVSA or the government.The US has previously defended its sanctions on Venezuela, with a senior US official saying in 2018: “The fact is that the greatest sanction on Venezuelan oil and oil production is called Nicolas Maduro, and PDVSA’s inefficiencies,” referring to the state-run oil body, Petroleos de Venezuela, SA.Mr De Zayas’s findings are based on his late-2017 mission to the country and interviews with 12 Venezuelan government minsters, opposition politicians, 35 NGOs working in the country, academics, church officials, activists, chambers of commerce and regional UN agencies.The US imposed new sanctions against Venezuela on 9 March 2015, when President Barack Obama issued executive order 13692, declaring the country a threat to national security.The sanctions have since intensified under Donald Trump, who has also threatened military invasion and discussed a coup.The situation in Venezuela could easily spiral into civil warAfter backing Mr Guaido on 23 January, Mr Trump said, “I will continue to use the full weight of United States\u0026nbspeconomic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy.”Venezuela has also described US sanctions as illegal. In 2018, foreign minister Jorge Arreaza said they were “madness, barbaric, and in absolute contradiction to international law”.Since 2015 around 1.9 million people have fled the country and on 23 October 2018 inflation reached 60,324 per cent, while the civilian death toll is unknown.Despite being the first UN official to visit and report from Venezuela in 21 years, Mr de Zayas said his research into the causes of the country’s economic crisis has so far largely been ignored by the UN and the media, and caused little debate within the Human Rights Council.He believes his report has been ignored because it goes against the popular narrative that Venezuela needs regime change.“When I come and I say the emigration is partly attributable to the economic war waged against Venezuela and is partly attributable to the sanctions, people don’t like to hear that. They just want the simple narrative that socialism failed and it failed the Venezuelan people,” Mr de Zayas told The Independent.Trump’s intervention in Venezuela is wholly undemocraticThe then UN high commissioner, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, reportedly refused to meet Mr de Zayas after the visit, and the Venezuela desk of the UN Human Rights Council also declined to help with his work after his return despite being obliged to do so, Mr de Zayas claimed.He told The Independent\u0026nbspthe office gave him the “cold shoulder” because they were worried his report, which is now published, would be too independent.“They are only interested in a rapporteur who is going to … do grandstanding, is going to condemn the government and ask for regime change. And I went there to listen. I went there to find out what’s actually going on,” Mr de Zayas said.A spokesperson for the office of the UN high commissioner said: “The 56 Special Procedures – of which Alfred de Zayas was one – are independent, as well as very numerous, and so it is not a practice for the high commissioner to meet with them inidually to discuss their reports. It would be physically impossible for him … to do so.” \u0026nbspThe spokesperson said the actions of the Venezuela desk are more “complicated” then Mr de Zayas described, adding, “calling for regime change is not our business”.Ivan Briscoe, Latin America and Caribbean programme director for Crisis Group, an international NGO, told The Independent that Venezuela is a polarising subject, iding those who support the socialist government and those who want to see a more US-aligned business friendly regime replace it.Briscoe is critical of Mr de Zayas’s report because it highlights US economic warfare but in his view neglects to mention the impact of a difficult business environment in the country which he believes is a symptom of “Chavismo” and the socialist governments’ failures.Guaidó declares himself interim president of VenezuelaHe said even if the sanctions are lifted, the country could not recover under current government policies, adding that Mr de Zayas’s report is the result of a “lawyer trying to understand the nature of supply and demand, and it didn’t quite work”.But, speaking before the news of Guaido’s coup attempt, Briscoe acknowledged rising tensions and the likely presence of US personnel operating covertly in the country.“Yes, something is going on. Yes there is talk of a military intervention. Which would be a very bad idea. But the fact of the matter is that the plan has been conceived in the context of the humanitarian crisis,” he said.Eugenia Russian, president of FUNDALATIN, one of the oldest human rights NGOs in Venezuela, founded in 1978 before the Chavez and Maduro governments and with special consultative status at the UN, spoke to The Independent on the significance of the sanctions.“In contact with the popular communities, we consider that one of the fundamental causes of the economic crisis in the country is the effect that the unilateral coercive sanctions that are applied in the economy, especially by the government of the United States,” Ms Russian said.She said\u0026nbspthere may also be causes from internal errors, but said probably few countries in the world have suffered an “economic siege” like the one Venezuelans are living under.The sanctions are part of a US effort to overthrow the Venezuelan government and instal\u0026nbspa more business friendly regime, as was done in\u0026nbspChile in 1973 and elsewhere in the region, Mr de Zayas said.“I’ve seen that happen in the Human Rights Council, how the United States twists arms and convinces countries to vote the way they want them to vote, or there will be economic consequences, and these things are not reflected in the press,” the former high-ranking UN official told The Independent.“What’s at stake is the enormous, enormous natural resources of Venezuela. And I sense that if Venezuela had no natural resources no one would give a damn about Chavez or Maduro or anybody else there,” Mr de Zayas added.EU leaders demands Venezuela’s Maduro calls election in eight days‘Kremlin-linked’ military contractors fly to Venezuela for Maduro ‘The people have to rise’: Venezuela’s top golfer on a state in crisisVenezuela’s opposition leader offers ‘amnesty’ for president MaduroTrump says ‘all options are on the table’ for Venezuela Over Venezuela, Trump shows himself to be like any other US presidentVenezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world and an abundance of other natural resources including gold, bauxite and coltan. But under the Maduro government they’re not easily accessible to US and transnational corporations.US oil companies had large investments in Venezuela in the early 20th century but were locked out after Venezuelans voted to nationalise the industry in 1973.“If you crush this government and you bring in a neoliberal government that is going to privatise everything and is going to sell out, a lot of transitional corporations stand to gain enormous profits and the United States is driven by the transnational corporations,” the former UN special rapporteur told The Independent.In his report, Mr de Zayas expressed concern that those calling the situation a “humanitarian crisis” are trying to justify regime change and that human rights are being “weaponised” to discredit the government and make violent overthrow more “palatable”.“Venezuela is going through one of the worst human rights crises in its history. The list of crimes under international law against the population is growing,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty’s Americas director, said in late 2018.“It is alarming that, instead of applying efficient public policies to protect people and reduce levels of insecurity, the Venezuelan authorities are using the language of war to try to legitimise the use of excessive force by police and military officials and, in many cases, the use of lethal force with intent to kill.”Mr De Zayas recommended dialogue between the international community and Venezuelans to make their government better, rather than squeezing the country with sanctions and backing coups. He proposed that Venezuela’s abundant natural wealth can help it recover once sanctions are lifted.“The key to the solution of the crisis is dialogue and mediation… There is nothing more undemocratic than a coup d’état and nothing more corrosive to the rule of law and to international stability when foreign governments meddle in the internal affairs of other states,” he told The Independent.“Only the Venezuelans have a right to decide, not the United States, not the United Kingdom … We do not want a repetition of the Pinochet putsch in 1973\u0026nbsp… What is urgent is to help the Venezuelan people through international solidarity – genuine humanitarian aid and a lifting of the financial blockade so that Venezuela can buy and sell like any other country in the world – the problems can be solved with good faith and common sense.”\u0026nbspMr De Zayas has since signed an open letter with Noam Chomsky and over 70 other academics and experts, condemning the US-backed coup attempt against the Venezuelan government.He called the recent developments “totally surreal”.Ms Russian, speaking about the economic crisis, said:\u0026nbsp“It is insufficient to see only the errors or deficiencies that the government may have, without seeing the environment of international pressure under which this population lives.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

latest","story":"But just what does a No Deal Brexit mean for the UK  Heres what we know so far.A no-deal British departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers are seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations are ongoing under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ahead of the UKs exit on March , .Some fear these talks could collapse without a deal agreed before the deadline.This could mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisationrules.On January , Boris Johnson claimed that a No Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No Deal Brexit it likely,  per cent thinks a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.Mrs May is fighting back against opponents of her blueprint for Brexit, saying Parliament will have to choose between her proposal and crashing out of the European Union without a deal.It would mean scrapping a -month transition period lasting until the end of , and the exit would be immediate.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to the Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.Theresa May announced on January  that a vote on her EU Withdrawal deal will take place on Tuesday, January , which was rejected  to .May has guaranteed MPs a vote on whether the controversial Brexit backstop is triggeredthe UK fails to conclude a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.She unveiled her plan B Brexit plan on January  and vowed to have another go with solving the issue of the back stop.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Businesses receive a -page document, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government over the next few days.The news comes as:Theresa May’s Government plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.Aides of Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed he would call on colleagues on Tuesday to dramatically accelerate No Deal planning given the deadlock over the PM’s Brexit deal.The Sun can revealed he ‘activated’ the NHS’ own plans – amid spiralling fears key medicines could be caught up in chaos at the border.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted

forsyth","story":"That evening, MPs will vote on a series of Brexit amendments designed to show the EU what kind of withdrawal agreement the Commons would accept. At least one of them needs to pass.If one does get the support of a majority of MPs, then Theresa May can go back to Brussels and say, look, this is what will get the deal through my parliament.It will strengthen her negotiating hand, make the EU engage and give her a chance of securing some changes.As one secretary of state says: “She needs to demonstrate she can carry something through.”No insiders tell me that May will only go back to Brussels “when we have a very clear set of proposals”. Butnone of these amendments can muster a majority, then the EU will just sit tight.It knows this parliament is fiercely opposed to No Deal and so isn’t concerned that the UK will actually go down that route.Instead, the EU will wait, confident that the UK will request either an extension to the Brexit process or a softening of it.So far, there are a iety of amendments down. One from the shop steward of backbench Tory MPs, Graham Brady, says the Commons will support the withdrawal agreementthe backstop is replaced by “alternative arrangements” to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Another from the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, Andrew ­Murrison, seeks to time-limit the backstop. Influential cabinet ministers have also been pushing for the Government to put down its own amendment.They are confident that they are winning that argument and one will go down before Tuesday — though some in Number  still prefer to put their faith in the Murrison amendment.The signicance of a Government amendment would be that Speaker John Bercow would have no choice but to call it. One indispensable minister involved in these discussions tells me: “A Government amendment could well be a more objective exit mechanism which would allow us to ­demonstrate that this is not going to be permanent.”The outline of this amendment has, I understand, been discussed with the DUP and ministers believe that the “likelihood” is that they will support it. But one cautions that “what may seem a given one day can suddenly unravel”.No won’t be drawn on whether a Government amendment will be tabled or not. But leading cabinet ministers are confident it will be. One says: “This is the best chance of moving everyone forward together.”One option being discussed is for a series of clear tests which,met, would allow the UK to exit the backstop. The aim is to make it clear that the EU couldn’t keep the UK — or Northern Ireland — in the backstop forever.There is also, I understand, “a parallel conversation” going on about what the EU will accept in terms of changes to the backstop. If a Government-backed amendment passed the Common it would also, in the words of one source, give the Government “half a chance of stopping Cooper-Boles”.The amendment from Labour’s Yvette ­Cooper and former Tory minister Nick Boles would require the Government to ask for an extension to Article  to avoid No Dealthe UK and the EU can’t come to an agreement.As this source points out: “Cooper-Boles does best when people think there isn’t an alternative.” There is no guarantee that a Government amendment will carry the day.“To pull this off, you need the ERGto come in behind it — and that’s quite a big ask,” says one of those intimately involved in these discussions.This source warns that “emotionally a lot of them will find it very dficult”. But these Brexiteer MPs need to realise thatnothing passes on Tuesday, then parliamentary efforts to extend Article  will gather more support.Brexit itself will be in danger and this country will end up with a super soft Andrex Brexit — or no Brexit at all.MPs should not do anything to suggest that they want to take No Deal off the table. This week, the EU and the Irish government have been all over the place about what No Deal would mean for the Irish border.The contradiction at the heart of the backstop is beginning to become apparent. It is, the EU and ­Ireland say, necessary to prevent a hard border. Butthe backstop results in there being No Deal, then it will lead to precisely what it is meant to avoid: A hard border.As this inconsistency becomes more and more obvious, there is more chance of member states pressing the EU to move on this issue.One minister who has been talking to his ­counterparts across the EU in the last few days tells me: “They’re ­definitely budging.”So, this would be precisely the wrong moment for MPs to undermine May’s negotiating position by talking about taking No Deal off the table. As one of those close to the PM puts it: “This has been a dficult week for the EU. Don’t make it easy for them.”This is one of the reasons why MPs MUST REJECT the Yvette Cooper amendment. At the moment, this amendment looks like it will probably pass. But given how many Labour MPs in leave-voting seats have qualms about it, this is far from certain.Tory MPs, let alone ministers, shouldn’t help it through as doing so would pull the rug from under the UK’s negotiating position.VENEZUELA is a sorry tale of where state socialism leads. In an oil-rich country, people are starving. It is embarrassing, and shaming, that Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological blinders mean that he can’t see what is happening there.Labour talk about opposing “outside interference” in Venezuela even as a slew of democracies in the region recognise the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president.Labour’s opposition to outside interference puts them in the same position as Russia, China, Turkey, Bolivia and Cuba. This is the company we’d be keepingCorbyn became Prime Minister.AT Cabinet this week, Theresa May told ministers that to get the deal through she would have to go to the Commons and “present a changed backstop”.This is signicant because it is her recognising that she needs substantive – not just cosmetic – changes to the backstopshe is to get her deal through.TALK of an early election just won’t go away at Westminster. It is not that the Tories want one, but that there is a sense that the Commons is so deadlocked on Brexit that it might end up as the only option.One possible route to an election is that Yvette Cooper’s plan to extend Article  passes the Commons, a deal is then eventually agreed but can only pass with the rider that there is a second referendum. I understand that, in these circumstances, the Government would rather go for an early election.One senior Cabinet Minister says that Theresa May’s “reddest of red lines is we have to leave the EU”.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela. But we’d be Caracas to let him try.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry was always very pally with [them], so this is very unlike him.“What people love about Harry is that he wears his heart on his sleeve,” Larcombe added.“He’s down to earth, a normal guy trapped in the royal world, and he doesn’t take himself very seriously. But now he is.”The dference, sources say, is Meghan — whose American independence is reportedly rubbing some royal insiders the wrong way.They claim that it’s been tough for the duchess, who is expecting a baby in April, to go from controlling her own personal and professional le to not being allowed to make all her own decisions.“During their tour, just before they were about to go to the Invictus Games, Meghan was bawling at her hairdresser to get her hair right, while at the same time someone was ironing the bottom of the dress she was wearing,” said a tour insider.Kensington Palace declined to comment.Larcombe said he is “not in the least surprised there’s been teething problems” as the duchess adjusts to her new le and the constraints that come with it.While her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, briefly held a position as a part-time fashion buyer before marrying Prince William, Meghan is unprecedented in that she previously had a high-profile acting and philanthropic career.“As an actress, Meghan expects perfection,” he said. “But when you’re in the royal family, you have to learn that it’s not about you, it’s about what you represent.”According to a longtime friend of Meghan’s, part of the culture clash comes from her eagerness to make her mark.“Meghan is a great girl — the kind you can go and have a drink with. She’s always there for her friends and is extremely loyal,” the friend told The Post, pointing out how the duchess has had the same close pals for years, including her college BFF Lindsay Roth and stylist Jessica Mulroney.But, the friend added, “She’s ballsy. She’s unashamedly ambitious — she has a great work ethic — and I can only imagine how that’s gone down inside the palace.”Indeed, Meghan has thrown herself into her work.She’s hands-on at the Royal Foundation, the philanthropic organisation she leads with her husband, Prince William and Kate.And Meghan recently aligned herself with three more pet causes: The National Theatre and The Association of Commonwealth Universities, both of which are patronages she took over from Queen Elizabeth, as well as the charities benefiting ­unemployed women and animal welfare.“Meghan wanted to get [deeply involved] from the beginning,” said a palace insider. “She’s very bright and questioned absolutely everything from her first briefing.”It was Meghan’s idea to publish a cookbook to aid the survivors of London’s Grenfell Tower fire, which caused the deaths of  people in June .The Duchess of Sussex’s hard-driving work ethic has even pushed sister-in-law Kate to work harder since her recentfrom maternity leave. “Kate has to keep up with Meghan!” said the palace insider.However, this ambition has also ruffled feathers, with three key members of Meghan and Harry’s staff resigning in the past few months.Among them, the couple’s private secretary, who had previously been the Queen’s personal secretary and was charged with helping Meghan settle into royal le.The duchess’ personal assistant had previously worked for singer Robbie Williams but, the Mirror reported, left the palace because “Meghan put a lot of demands on her and it ended up with her in tears.”Similarly, Harry and Meghan’s chief protection officer quit after only six months because of resistance from the duchess.“Even though [Meghan] was a famous actress, she could still do what she wanted in the way of getting around freely,” a source told the Daily Mail.“But in her current role she can’t go anywhere without her protection team, and that’s a massive constraining force on an inidual like her.”All of this is stressing out her husband, sources say.“Harry wants to be protective of Meghan,” Larcombe explained. “If she’s getting frustrated and stressed, he is the one reading the riot act to the staff and doing the demanding on her behalf.“But you can’t blame Meghan, she’s gone into her biggest role yet and she’s put her heart and soul into it. Yes, she is firing off e-mails to staff at  a.m., but she’s super-keen and Harry is taking his lead from her. He is under a lot of pressure behind the scenes.”Adding to tensions are Meghan’s extended-family members.While her yoga teacher mother, Doria Ragland, remains dignied and quiet at home in Los Angeles, Meghan’s dad and half-siblings have been outspoken after their feud with Meghan.Next up, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will soon relocate to their new home at Frogmore Cottage — which has undergone a £million renovation — within the grounds of Windsor Castle. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would mean leaving the door open to No Deal and going back to the EU and demanding signicant changes. If she does then that’s great. If not, then all the discussions of the past few weeks have been pointless.In a second boost, Cabinet sources said the government now believes the EU is about to blink first on the backstop.It has become increasingly clear it is the main sticking point and with  days until Brexit, its removal would provide a le-saver for Mrs May, a solution for Brussels and a face-saving climbdown for Brexiteers and Leavers alike.About  to  Brexit hardliners are said to be looking for a “ladder” to end their stand against the deal – amid fears Remainers could force Britain to stay in the EU.But the powerful European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, has privately warned the PM she must set out exactly what concessions she will seek from the EUshe is to win back their full support.They insist she doesn’t need to extend Article  as we have agreed to a two-year implementation period.On Saturday she was given a further boost as the Irish government’s insistence on the need for a backstop collapsed into chaos.Dublin’s Europe minister Helen McEntee was forced to take to the airwaves promising never to erect a hard border hours after her PM Leo Varadkar warned troops could be deployed to man crossings in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Britain’s former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson said: “The Irish government is clearly in disarray over the backstop.“They have stirred up hysteria over the border as a mechanism to bully us into staying.

The only way to stop No Deal is for a majority for another solution to emerge.From my conversations with our EU partners it is clear they will not agree to delay Brexit without a plan for how we are going to approve a deal.Matt Hancock today echoed his words, saying that delaying Brexit won’t help solve these problems and would just kick the can further down the road.The news came as:Theresa May is set to refuse her Tories and ministers to vote for the plans, led by a series of rebels including Labours Yvette Cooper.But other ministers have refused to rule out resigningthey arent allowed to block it.Today Tobias Ellwood broke ranks to say the Government should officially take No Deal off the table as it would make Britain poorer, weaker and smaller to the world.He wrote in the same newspaper it was simply wrong for Mrs May to spend any more money on preparing to leave with nothing.Remainers Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond have both dodged questions on whether they would resign over No Deal.Although the debate will be on a so-called neutral motion, stating only that the Commons has considered her statement, MPs will have the power to table amendments dictating what should happen next.Speaker John Bercow -

giving ministers until the end of the  to secure a withdrawal agreement.The bill is a standalone law, but an amendment to the PMs statement would see it catapulted to the top of the Commons agenda.Jeremy Corbyn is likely to support the move, which would give it a good chance of passing.GRIEVE - WRECKING BREXITDominic Grieve has proposed an amendment which would effectively transfer power from the Government to the Commons.Under the terms of his proposal, MPs would get the power to decide which bills are debated in Parliament, a privilege usually held by ministers.The amendment would tear up centuries of precedent by limiting the Governments ability to govern and so is unlikely to succeed.MURRISON - PMS LIFELINETory Brexiteer Andrew Murrison has an amendment which could help the PM make her case in Brussels.It takes the form of a demand for a time limit on the hated Irish backstop plan, to stop Britain being trapped in the EU customs union permanently.If Conservative backbenchers support it, Mrs May could then use that as proof that all she needs to get the deal through Parliament is a tweak to the backstop -

Three of the four crew members aboard the Russian Tu-M were killed in the tragic incident in the Arctic last week. During the dramatic footage - which shows the full scale of the terrying incident - the plane approaches the runway at speed and touches down. However, the aircraft bounces and starts breaking up and quickly erupts into two fireballs - one in the cockpit section which breaks away from the rest of the plane. The clip was taken at the Olenya air base above the arctic circle and clearly shows the planes heavy impact with the runway. Russian defence officials say the plane was on a training flight and was unarmed - however unconfirmed reports suggest there was a missile on board.    Reports also suggest that the commander Major Alexey Guryev lost control as he landed at a remote airbase. The damaged cockpit was later seen lying on its side in a snowfield an unknown distance from the rest of the wreckage which is visibly charred. Guryev, , died at the scene. A tribute has been set up to the captain and the two other airmen who perished in the crash - co-pilot Konstantin Mazunin and navigator Viktor Greyf. An emotional message honouring Greyf, , who died as he was rushed to hospital, was posted his teenage son on social media. Kirill, , wrote: “You are my hero! You are the very best!” Another navigator Maxim Rylkov survived the crash but was reported to be in a grave condition. Guryev - a father of one - was from a dynasty of Russian air force pilots and had followed in the footsteps of his father German.   His eight year old son was named German after his grandfather. There is implied criticism of the crew in an official accident report that leaked two days after the crash. It claimed the captain “allowed the landing of the aircraft without levelling”. The unbalanced plane then broke apart with impact and began to “destroy”, said the report. The cockpit and the rest of the aircraft which erupted in flames were detached. “The crew did not respond the commands of flight management team,” said the leaked report. “The fuselage burned down.”    There were also claims the captain insisted on landing despite being urged to use another air base. “Currently, all possible versions of the incident, including a technical mal, are being considered,” said a military source. The crash was at Olenya air base, near Olenegrosk, on the Kola Peninsula some  miles south of Murmansk city. Aviation expert Vadim Lukashevich believed that the crash was likely caused by a vertical wind gust that suddenly hit the plane before touchdown, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. Accounts at the time suggested blizzard conditions.  The Tupolev bomber - an aircraft in service since the Soviet era - can strike targets , miles from base, and is a key war plane for potential deployment against the West. It has a crew of four. The crashed aircraft was reported to be  years old. It underwent a major overhaul in . Military investigators have started the crash probe, Last time a Tu-M crashed in summer  in Novgorod region, killing all four crew members. The latest accident came less than a week after two Su- bombers collided in the Russian Far East during a scheduled training exercise last Friday. Only one of the four crew members was rescued.

The Shadow Education Secretarys comments emphasise a split in the Labour party on whether Jeremy Corbyn should swing behind a so-called Peoples Vote. A poll this month found % of Labour members back a new referendum. Yet only  Labour MPs have publicly demanded one and Mr Corbyn is resisting calls to back it.Instead the party is still keeping a second referendum as an option on the table.  Ms Rayner told Sky News Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I would be really worried about a second referendum to be honest.I don’t think people necessarily will expect the result they get. I thinkanything it will be very narrow. And worst case scenario is it will be a very narrow Remain. And then what  We’re going to have the best of three  Labour is seriously considering backing a bid to delay Brexit beyond March  this Tuesday night, in order to prevent a No Deal.   The Commons amendment by MP Yvette Cooper is likely to passLabour backs it. If it does, MPs would choose how long to extend Brexit for, before asking for approval from the EU. Yet Ms Rayner said: I dont think people want to see a delay in Article  [which set the date of Brexit]. She added: I think thatwe end up in a second referendum, us as politicians have failed the public. We’ve failed to be able to do our job. I will see that as a really dficult situation for us all to be in. However,there was a new vote, she added: I probably would vote Remain.   I would probably vote Remain and the reason is Ive seen over the last . years all the analysis we have got at the moment. Were in the EU, we get benefits from being part of the EU and I believe that to be the right thing for the UK. I believed that at the start of this process when I made my first vote and I still believe that to be the case. When askedLabour would back Yvette Coopers Brexit amendment, Ms Rayner signalled the party would - but onlyits the only option we have.  She said: Labour will do whatever it takes to avoid a no-deal Brexit, sothats the only option we have its something we will seriously consider. Let me be as clear as I possibly can be for the people that are listening to this programme - weve put our amendment down, weve said we respected the result of the referendum, we want to find a deal, we want a customs union, we want protection for environment, consumer, employment. Weve said that all along. Theresa May will not budge on her red lines, shes forcing us and trying to bully us into a no-deal scenario.We will do whatever it takes, through Parliament, to stop that no-deal scenario from happening. If that means backing an amendment, then we will do that.

The Republics deputy PM blasted Mrs May as it emerged shes considering backing a demand to scrap a crucial clause called the Irish backstop. The backstop is the main reason MPs defeated the -page Brexit deal by a record -vote majority this month. But now veteran MP Graham Brady is leading a group of Tories who say theyll change their mind and back the deal -the backstop is replaced with alternative arrangements. And Cabinet minister Matt Hancock has confirmed the government will listen very carefully to Sir Grahams call - whichpassed on Tuesday, would send an ultimatum to the EU to think again. But Irelands rattled Deputy PM Simon Coveney blasted the plan and claimed the EU wont accept it. “Your Prime Minister signed up to the backstop as a compromise which was designed around her and Britain’s red lines, he told the BBC.  The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines. Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.”  Mr Coveney said abandoning the backstop would mean relying on an aspirational hope with no clear image of what comes next. He added: The European Parliament will not raty a Withdrawal Agreement that doesnt have a backstop in it. Its as simple as that. The backstop is an insurance policy which would kick in on  January there is still no arrangement to keep the border open between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It would prevent ato the violence of the Troubles - but the price would be trapping the UK under EU customs rules indefinitely.  Tory MP Graham Brady has laid an amendment to Theresa Mays Brexit plans, saying the government requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border. The amendment by Sir Graham, chairman of the Tory backbench  Committee, is one of  being laid by MPs ahead of a vote on Tuesday. Askedthe government would back it, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC: I think we have got to listen very carefully to people who are willing to vote for the deal subject to some amendments.  And I think we need to build that majority in the Commons, clearly. And this was one of the proposals thats coming from a wide range of people who want to get a deal through and have that good future relationship. He added: “Whether it’s that exact one - we don’t know which amendments the Speaker will select and so we don’t know exactly the shape of the debate on Tuesday. “But I do understand the impulse behind those who are laying that amendment. Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns went further, demanding Theresa May bin the backstop completely. She also suggested the PM replace her chief negotiator Olly Robbins with her own husband Philip May - who reportedly urged her to keep going with her deal.  But Mr Coveney suggested binning the backstop had no chance of success in the EU. He said: There are ways of resolving these issues - in my view, by changing the aspirations in the future relationship declaration which in my view will reassure people that the backstop is never likely to be used. That is the way I hope these negotiations will go, rather than the British Parliament deciding on something that may command a majority in Westminster but has no chance of getting agreement or ratication in the EU. Ireland’s Europe Minister Helen McEntee added: To suggest that we would compromise on the Irish backstop is suggesting that we would compromise on the leading requirement ensure that we protect the peace that we’ve had for the past  years. To put a unilateral clause in a backstop, to put a time limit on the backstop, it ceases to become a backstop or it ceases to be a backstop”. Despite Irelands comments, government sources and Mr Hancock suggested there was still wriggle room around removing the current backstop - as long as it gets a smart replacement. Mr Hancock denied Mr Coveneys comments meant Theresa Mays Brexit deal was dead in the water, saying: Not at all. He added: Thats a negotiating position the Irish are taking, but I think its also extremely clear from that interview and the tone... is that Ireland doesnt want to have a no-deal Brexit. The whole purpose of the backstop is to avoid a hard border, which risks being a consequence of a no-deal Brexit. The idea the EU and the Irish Government would drive this process to a no-deal exit in order to try to achieve something which is intended to avoid no-deal Brexit, that is not going to happen. Meanwhile Labour are still considering whether to back the most likely amendment to pass on Tuesday - one that would delay the  March date of Brexit. Yvette Cooper, the MP behind the bid, said today it will be up to MPs to decide how long a delay is for. The EU would still have to sign off a delay - but in a boost to the delayers, Mr Coveney said Ireland will not be an obstacle to doing that.

The two Old Etonians have been chumming up Mr Rees-Moggs pound.million, five-storey, five-bedroom home a stones throw from Westminster.Bumbling Brexiteer Boris was spotted arriving on his bicycle for a drinks party after inflicting the biggest ever Commons defeat on Theresa Mays Brexit deal.But the soirees have gone a lot further than that one celebration, the Mail on Sunday reports. According to the newspaper a string of MPs - mostly new members since  - have been invited to discreet dinners at Mr Rees-Moggs home. They are reportedly given wine and told about the virtues of Mr Johnson before a speech from the straw-haired slippery one himself.  Its because MPs are still a major hurdle to Boris Johnson getting on a leadership ballotTheresa May resigns.He is popular with the Tory grassroots, but only MPs two top candidates are ever allowed to go to a full vote by party members. That means MPs could band together to keep Boris Johnson off the ballot paper. Mr Rees-Moggs new mansion was recently used as offices and has four reception rooms, cast iron fireplaces and towering ceilings.  It is even closer to Parliament than Downing Street is, and was until recently the political HQ of Tory mega-donor Lord Ashcroft .The Old Etonian Brexiteer paid pound.million for the five-storey, five-bedroom home through private bank Coutts a year ago. Mr Rees-Mogg confirmed dinners had taken place but claimed they were relatively informal conversations to see where people in the party are.

The move has been described by sources as the civil service prepping for all possibilities. The revelation came as further Government splits emerged over whether Britain should quit the EU without an agreement as Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood broke ranks and insisted a no-deal scenario must be ruled out. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the government was drawing up plans to impose martial law and curfews in a no deal Brexit. Of course the Government all of the time looks at all the options for all circumstances, he told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show. But he insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention.  A Downing Street spokesperson said: Respecting the referendum decision means leaving the EU. The PM has said that there will be disruption in the event of no deal, but as a responsible Government we are taking the appropriate steps to minimise this disruption and ensure the country is prepared.   In other measures the Government sought to extend working hours for MPs in order to get Brexit legislation through the Commons before the scheduled EU withdrawal date of March . Responding to news the Government was looking at the possibility of a martial law scenario, Labour MP and Best for Britain campaign supporter, David Lammy said: This is a full-blown crisis. The Government is recklessly drawing up plans for a colossal act of self-harm. Through continuing on the path to Brexit, despite having achieved no consensus on a deal in Parliament, the Government is preparing to declare war on itself. The idea that the Government has any mandate for this catastrophic scenario is ludicrous. The Leave campaign promised a stable new trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, not total isolation and soldiers in our airports.   Despite Prime Minister Theresa May refusing to take the prospect of a no deal off the table, Mr Ellwood wrote in the Sunday Times: It is now time to rule out the very possibility of no deal. It is wrong for Government and business to invest any more time and money in a no deal outcome which will make us poorer, weaker and smaller in the eyes of the world. Also writing in the Sunday Times, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom branded bids by some backbench MPs to kill no deal as an option via a series of Commons amendments on Tuesday as a thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit. In a bid to try and ensure Brexit legislation gets through the Commons and Lords in time for the planned March exit, Parliaments February recess is to be cancelled, and MPs will be made to start earlier and finish later on sitting days. The move comes after the Commons Leader suggested that leaving the EU might need to be delayed by a couple of weeks in order to get all the legislation through. Reports that the Number  chief of staff Gavin Barwell had criticised the role of the Prime Ministers husband Philip May in Brexit discussions were dismissed as utter bunkum by a Downing street spokesperson.

Thats because EU countries will demand you have at least six months left before your passport expires on your date of travel. That is dferent to the situation now, where you can enter France or Germany evenyour passport only has a week left. HM Passport Office is now sending out texts urging people to checkthey need to renew. So here is the governments guidance for whether you need to renew.   Will my passport be valid after Brexit  British passports will carry on being valid to travel to the EU after Brexit. However,there is no Brexit deal, the UK will be counted as a third country after  March . That meansyou are travelling to Schengen area countries, you must have at least six months left on your passport from the date of travel.  The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. When should I renew my passport  The government is advising most travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip.If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. Whatmy passport was valid for more than  years Some Brits will have to renew their passports  MONTHS earlythere is a No Deal Brexit .The government has revealed a little-known loophole that could bar families from holiday hotspots like France and Spain this summer. Since last year, Brits have been warned to have at least six months left on their passportthey want to travel to the EU in a No-Deal. But now officials admit some people will need to renew much earlier than that. Its because between  and September , some UK passports were issued with up to nine months extra lespan on top of the usual  years. Yet those extra months - awarded when people carried over time from their old passport - wont countyou are entering the EU.Soyou have a passport that is valid for longer than  years, youshould notjust count six months back from the expiry date to find out when it wont be valid. Instead you should count  years and six monthsforwardfrom the date it was issued to find out when itll no longer be valid in the EU.  Will I have to pay to visit the EU  If there is no Brexit deal, you will probably have to pay for the privilege of visiting the EU.Short-term trips wont need a visa, but they will need avisa waiver.This is predicted to cost Brits € .  If there is a Brexit deal, the above advice does not apply. UK citizens will enjoy free, unlimited travel to the EU until at least  December , as long as their passports are in date.

There he stands every day in an EU top hat, pops up behind BBC interviewees and bellows STOP BREXIT!. In the ultimate act of trollingthe pad is on the same street as Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Moggs five-storey pound.million mansion - which is opposite him a few doors down. And the odd couple neighbours are already getting on famously - with Mr Rees-Mogg offering his new neighbour a cup of sugar. Mr Bray, from Port Talbot, confirmed on Twitter : We rent the house  nights a week on AirBnb paid for by supporters in fundraiser.Ive stopped taking sugar in my tea but thank you very much Mr Rees-Mogg.The Welshman infamously heckled Jacob Rees-Mogg while the Tory announced he was sending a letter of no confidence in Theresa May . His eccentric protests, which include bellowing STOP BREXIT at the top of his lungs daily outside Parliament, have interrupted countless TV interviews. Broadcasters even erected a scaffolding tower to avoid his placards popping up in the background - an effort he promptly ruined by sticking his signs on ft poles. Mr Bray told the Mirror in November: Im patriotic. Im Welsh, Im British, Im European.  We are all better together. History has taught us that. And Mr Rees-Mogg -youre listening - you are NOT going to destroy our nation. More than  people have contributed pound, to the effort to keep Mr Bray and his team in the Airbnb until at least March , racking up a pound, bill. The fundraising site wrote: Having a temporary campaign HQ right in the heart of Westminster has given Steve Bray extra energy.The whole team are able to come together, share supper and plan the next days strategy to keep several steps ahead of the Leave campaign. Extra funds are thought to have come from high-profile Remain campaigner and Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins, the Mail on Sunday reported.

Campaigning MP Stella Creasy wanted to repeal Northern Irelands Victorian-era anti-abortion law as part of the new Domestic Abuse Bill. Unlike the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland has a ban on abortions in almost all cases - even rape or incest.But the ultra-conservative DUP, whose  MPs prop Theresa May up in power in exchange for pound.bn, are deeply against abortion in the region. Now Labour MP Ms Creasy claims the scope of the Bill has been restricted, a technical move that stops her bringing her reforms forward.The furious MP tweeted: This government cares more about the DUP than domestic violence.  Proof [is that] theyve restricted scope of Domestic Abuse Bill to try to prevent abortion reform in Northern Ireland. Wont just affect Northern Ireland but all VAWG . [I am] asking every MP to join me ensuring this scam wont work. Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips added: The Domestic Abuse Bill cannot be used as a tool to appease the DUP. It would be so much stronger with UK wide immigration and welfare changes in it, and to keep them out for fear of amendments about Northern Ireland women is to undermine the safety of victims from across the UK.  The current law has led thousands of Northern Ireland women to travel to Britain for terminations in what a QC has branded physical and mental torture. It also leaves Northern Ireland with stricter laws than in the Republic of Ireland after a referendum relaxed the law last year. The Abortion Act of  means terminating pregnancies is legal in England, Wales and Scotland. But it is largely prohibited in Northern Ireland through section  of the Offences Against the Person Act . A measure which would have given Westminster jurisdiction over abortion laws in the bill has been dropped, The Sunday Times reported. A Cabinet Office source told the newspaper: A bright civil servant foresaw the potential for the legislation to cause problems for the DUP.

It was  and some people were shocked and embarrassed, complaining that graphic gynaecological jokes had no place on the BBC under the name “alternative comedy”. But I found it hysterical. I’d recently had my first smear test and, having worried unnecessarily for weeks, thought humour could tackle the taboo for others. Returning every three years, I’d remember Ben marvelling at a woman’s ability to endure “an ice cold, duck-billed torpedo being shoved up your khyber”. And joking that the most terrying phrase in a doctor’s vocabulary was: “Knees apart, keep your bottom down, I am about to drive something not dissimilar to a Ford Cortina into your vagina.”   But in his OTT routine Ben also drove home the message to young women: “You’ve got to do this, it’s terribly important.” In the  years since, tests for cervical cancer have changed no end. Those scary metal speculums have been replaced by disposable ones in ying sizes. So an experienced nurse can do the biz in  seconds with minimum discomfort – as we saw on Friday’s Victoria Derbyshire TV show. But why did they need to demonstrate this live on BBC  Because cervical screening uptake is at a -year low.   Five million women are overdue for testing and polls show  per cent of the  to -year-old delayers feel “too body-conscious” to attend. Worrying about how they look “downstairs” and ashamed of being examined means theyre missing potentially le-saving tests. Yet some would happily visit a beautician for an eye-watering Brazilian wax. Around , British women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year. A thousand die from it. But rates are predicted to rise  per cent in the next two decades.  After the reality TV star Jade Goody, , died from the cancer in , , extra women attended their screenings. But now that Jade effect has been wiped out, aided by unreal body images on social media. We need to break these new taboos and remove the fear from the smear. Or, as cervical cancer charities warn, “women will die from embarrassment”. That’s a shocking and terrying phrase in anyone’s vocabulary.

The Commission made recent headlines with its proposed worldwide health diet which said people should eat no more than a p-sized beef burger each day.  Its report blames lack of political leadership for preventing effective action against obesity and malnutrition. And it slams major food and drinks firms for focusing on profits and encouraging over-consumption of “unhealthy” products. The National Obesity Forum has thrown its weight behind the report.

A bridge worker had spotted the empty pushchair and reported it to police. When officers checked CCTV they saw harrowing images of a woman pushing the buggy and then falling into the water.Humber Rescue teams were dispatched, along with a helicopter, reports the Hull Daily Mail .Miraculously, the mother and daughter were spotted by bridge staff and thrown a lebelt, which they clung to until they were rescued. Both had survived their terrying ordeal and were pulled from the water, an estimated  minutes after they fell from the bridge. In a controversial move, police decided to charge the woman with the attempted murder of her daughter after she recovered. They were taken to Hull Royal Infirmary by helicopter, where the toddler was treated for hypothermia and the effects of swallowing water. Rescuers said it was a chance in a million that they fell on a still evening with no tide movement.   It later transpired the woman had written ‘cause of death’ and then her husband’s name in indelible ink. The mum, who suffered a fractured spine, was discharged from hospital two months later. But that was not the end of the remarkable and tragic story. Police and prosecutors defended the decision to charge her and said they were correct to prosecute and hoped it would serve as a warning to other people. A Humberside Police detective admitted that the June  case was one of the more dficult his career and that the decision to prosecute had weighed heavily on the conscience of investigators. He said: “We had to balance many considerations during this investigation. “The woman was in a desperate state, but she went to the Humber Bridge knowing what she was going to do. “People have to be aware that whatever mental state they are in they are accountable for their actions. “I hope this serves as a warning to other people. Help is available and people should seek it.” More details of the case came out during the court hearing, in which the mum pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted murder. The woman admitted she had set out with the intention of killing herself, but could not recall what led her to take her daughter, who was three days from her third birthday.   Judge Michael Mettyear, the Recorder of Hull, said he could not accept her actions were not premeditated and that only a custodial sentence could be justied. This is one of the most dficult cases I have ever had to deal with, he said. It is dficult because on the one hand you are an intelligent woman, you have no previous convictions and you pleaded guilty at the very first opportunity. On the other hand your conduct was very likely to kill your child. Of the  people who jumped off the bridge I was told that  died. It was a remarkable piece of luck that you and she survived unscathed. The court heard she had reached the depths of despair after the break-up of her marriage. She met her husband when she was seven months pregnant with her daughter. She was deeply religious and believed the deaths would lead to an afterle where she could be with her daughter in a place where they could be happy together.The court heard that after struggling to cope with losing custody of her daughter , the mum became increasingly concerned for the girls welfare.In a letter she had written: I had no hope of receiving help from the court or where. I do believe in the afterle. Solving the problems of this world seemed no longer possible. This is how I came to seek our safety in another world. I did not do this to get rid of my child or to hurt my husband or anybody . When I was in the water and my daughter was screaming, scared and cold it was me who felt the most pain. My child was now suffering more than before. Im forever grateful for those who saved my little princess. In seeing my child so poorly and so scared I knew that I had made everything worse.   A psychiatrist said the mum was suffering from a depressive disorder as a result of her lack of contact with the child. The woman ended up being jailed for  months in a case Judge Mettyear described as “one of the most dficult of his career”. The woman appealed the sentence and Court of Appeal judge Lord Phillips said he wanted to show the woman “mercy” as he agreed for her to be released from prison after just three months. Lord Phillips said of Judge Mettyear: “This experienced judge found this tragic case presented a most dficult problem. The fact he granted permission to appeal showed he had reservations. “We have to ask ourselves, was this a case that required a custodial sentence and ... was it really necessary to sentence this unhappy woman to prison, to punish her for the momentary aberration that led her to try to take her and her daughter’s le  “We say momentary, because she immediately regretted it. There is one word you will not read in the sentencing guidelines, and that word is mercy. “There are occasions when the courts can put guidelines to one side and apply mercy instead. “We have reached the conclusion that this is one such case and we quash the sentence of imprisonment imposed.” Whatever youre going through, you can call the Samaritans free at any time, from any phone on  .

Some paints use milk products or beeswax as a binder and can be tested on animals before being deemed safe for use. As a result, Meghan has opted to use the Organic and Natural Paint Co, and is going for neutral whites and greys, reportsThe Sun. An insider said: Meghan has been looking long and hard at paints for the Sussex nursery. Rather than opt for fashionable Farrow and Ball paint in favoured shades such as Wevet, Peignoir and Pavilion Grey and Salmon, the Sussexes are much in favour of The Organic  Natural Paint Co’s Auro range for the nursery. High tech Meghan and Harrys new home is going to be filled with all the latest tech and its likely that theyll be able to control many dferent things from their phones.

Bernie Brown is convinced her brave father Jim Brown somehow swapped places with little Finn, dying from the cruel condition as the youngster began to recover. Throughout two-year-old Finns battle with cancer Jim, , often said he wished he could trade places with the brave tot.But in a tragic twist of fate, Jims wish seemed to come true when he was taken to hospital with lung cancer in  just as Finn was winning his own battle.Jim, a veteran of the Korean War, passed away just  weeks later. Finn is now eight having battled the disease before his second birthday.Now, Bernie has written a moving poem to express her love for her dad, the Liverpool Echo reported.“He had sat on our sofa on diagnosis day and wept and said, it should have been me, I am an old man, Bernie recalled.   “It didn’t take long before I reflected on the meaning behind my dad’s diagnosis and his clear wish to trade places with Finn. Called Why Him Not Me , the poem has been entered into a competition in Liverpool as part of the th anniversary of the cancer charity Pause for Hope. “[The poem] is testament to my dad who, in the face of his terminal diagnosis, was courageous enough to know it was right he died to allow his grandson to live, Bernie said. “He took this responsibility in the same way as when a -year-old he went to Korea to serve in the forgotten war.” In another bittersweet moment, Bernie was heavily pregnant with her third son Sebastian when Jim was taken into hospital with lung cancer and gave birth on the same day Jims last battle ended and he died.   Sebastian was born on the day of his funeral – hours after I had read his eulogy, she said. “It was a beautul moment, and a fitting tribute to an amazing man, my dad, Jim Brown who was courageous in every aspect of his le – right to the end. “In his last week, we had a wonderful conversation about why it was better that he died and Finn lived – he celebrated the wonders of le and died at peace with everyone and everything – he lives on in his grandsons Toby, Finn, and Seb, and is so very well remembered.” A great believer in giving back, this year Bernie will be climbing Machu Picchu to raise money for Nicola’s Fund, a charity that supports the families of children diagnosed with cancer. Charity founders Debbie and Steve Riley were instrumental during Finn’s illness, sending the family to Centre Parcs to keep things as normal as possible. The experience has left an indelible mark on Bernie who is determined to show that ‘families can come through the other side’. She said: “I take great comfort from the belief that it was a trade and the events that followed including Sebastian’s birth on the day of the funeral only confirmed my spiritual sense that this was a le cycle moment,a precious gt of le from granddad to grandson, from father to daughter. “I am proud to be his daughter.” Why Him not Me  Bernies poem in full...

Lisa Fletcher, , gave birth to baby Lillie-Grace at  weeks term, the day after doctors told the mum-of-three her daughter had passed away in the womb. But thanks to a cold cot, Lisa and husband Nik Fletcher, , were able to take Lillie-Grace home and even introduced her to their relatives. Ever since their daughters death in October , full-time mum Lisa and handyman Nik have devoted their lives to transforming hundreds of donated wedding frocks into funeral gowns known as angel dresses for other babies who have passed away.   Mum-of-four Lisa, from Killamarsh, Derbyshire, said: From the first moment I saw Lillie-Grace it was pure, unconditional love. I felt so proud because I was still a mum and I was able to hold her and kiss her and spend that time with her. Unless youve been through this you wont understand. I carried my baby and she was part of my family, so I wanted to treat her as any other of my children. Parents in this position shouldnt be frightened of getting judged or what people think. Love is love. Now, we keep Lillie-Graces memory alive by making these gowns for other babies to help parents going through this devastating journey. We believe that every baby no matter how small still deserves something special.   Lisa, who has three older children, had a straightforward pregnancy after conceiving through IVF, with her and Nik hoping to complete their family with a child of their own. But tragedy struck just days before Lisa was due to give birth when doctors told the mum her little girl had died in the womb. Lisa then had to face the heartache of having a c-section while knowing that Lillie-Grace was already dead. She said: As soon as the surgery was over, the doctors gave Lillie-Grace to Nik to hold her. She looked like a sleeping angel, she was absolutely perfect. Even the doctor said she looked beautul. The staff treated her like she was a normal baby.   Lisa and Nik were then moved to a bereavement suite and the following day had their daughter baptised in the hospital chapel. They spent two days in the hospital before they ed to their house to spend a precious night at home with their now-complete family. Lisa introduced Lillie-Grace to her three other children as well as family and friends. They also put her in her Moses basket at the foot of their bed for her first and final night at home. She said: We had already planned Lillie-Graces Christening and bought her dress, so even though she wasnt with us it still felt the right thing to do. Being able to see the sun come through the stain glass windows while we held her in the chapel was wonderful. After we had her christened, we sat outside with her in the hospital garden and watched the autumn afternoon roll in.  The one thing I wanted to do was to bring her home and put her next to my bed in her own cot, which we had already bought her. I introduced her to her grandparents and my best friends. They all said how perfect she looked. It was devastating though explaining to them what had happened. Being able to share her with the people I loved and to make memories with her was so special. We were all together, although it was a terrible situation, it was just perfect. We were able to bring her into our family and show her her home. Going to bed that night and knowing she was there was so peaceful and calming. We were all under one roof together. The following day, the couple went to the funeral home where they visited Lillie-Grace daily in the eight days before her funeral. The day before her funeral Lisa and Nik held Lillie-Grace for one final time before putting her in her tiny coffin with a parting letter.  Now, the couple visit their daughters grave four times a week and kiss it goodbye each time they leave. Lisa and Nik now also devote themselves to making gowns for babies who pass away. Each delicate white gown is sewn from donated wedding or bridesmaid dresses and sent to hospitals, funeral homes and families direct free of charge. Lisa said: Every time we visit Lillie-Grace, we tell her how much we miss her and how much we love her and how sorry we are that we wont see her grow up. We make the dresses to help as many other families as we can who are yet to walk this devastating journey and give them something unique and special that is made with so much love for their beautul little angels. Hopefully, it gives them a little comfort to know that they are not alone.

The five-year-old, who is third in line to the throne , was out with his grandma Carole Middleton when a dog walker spotted him playing in a stream with younger sister Princess Charlotte. It is reported the dog walker started chatting to the young royals near Bucklebury, Berkshire. Speaking to The Sun , the woman said: I was asked by a police minder not to take a photo of the children, which I didn’t, but George started stroking my dog. Just to be friendly I engaged in a bit of small talk and I asked George what his name was, even though obviously I knew it. To my astonishment he said I’m called Archie with a big smile on his face. I don’t know why he calls himself Archie but kids often play with their names and I think it’s lovely.   Archie originally comes from Germany. In Scotland though, it is a short form of Archibald, meaning true, bold and brave. But George already has several nicknames, as do many other members of the royal family. His middle names are Alexander and Louis. At school, the boy is reportedly known as PG and his parents then started calling him PG Tips or just Tips after the tea. Prince William was dubbed Wombat by mumDiana. And at university he called himself Steve as he tried to blend in with fellow students.

In his surprise note, dated the dayAFTERthe Sunday Mirror revealed he had not made contact, the -year-old Duke wished Emma Fairweather, pictured right, a “speedy recovery”.Injured carer Emma, , said: “It was a nice touch. He made the admission in a signed letter sent to Emma Fairweather, who was in Kia in collision with his x. In his note – written a day after the Sunday Mirror revealed he hadNOTbeen in touch with Emma – the Duke said he was “shaken” by the collision. The typed -word message finally arrived six days after the smash and was signed “Yours sincerely, Philip” – in blue pen. Emma, , said: “When I opened it I saw the Sandringham House headed paper and went ‘Oh my God!’   “He asked how I was and said sorry that I was in pain. I was chuffed. “I thought it was really nice that he signed off as ‘Philip’ and not the formal title. I was pleasantly surprised because of the personalised nature. “A lot of people said it was unrealistic that I wanted that human kindness from Prince Philip – which is what I saw this letter as.” The note, thought to have been hand-delivered to Emma’s home in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, is dated January , four days after the crash. Emma received it on January .  The letter, in full, says: “I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident at the Babingley cross-roads. “I have been across that crossing any number of times and I know very well the amount of traffic that uses that main road. It was a bright sunny day and at about three in the afternoon, the sun was low over the Wash.   “In other words, the sun was shining low over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no dficulty in seeing traffic coming from the Dersingham direction, but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences. “I was somewhat shaken after the accident, but I was greatly relieved that none of you were seriously injured. “As a crowd was beginning to gather, I was advised toto Sandringham House by a local Police Officer. I have since learned that you suffered a broken arm. I am deeply sorry about this injury. “I wish you a speedy recovery from a very distressing experience.”   Emma, a care support worker, was left in crippling pain after the crash. She has been signed off for two months and has instructed solicitors to pursue a compensation claim. The Kia was driven by her friend Ellie Townsend, , and Ellie’s nine-month-old son was also in the car. Although Prince Philip, , refers to it being sunny, Emma recalls the day being overcast. She said: “He’s tried to give an explanation so I appreciate that, whether I agree with it or not. It is a dficult letter to write – to know what would be the right thing to say without making me more upset.”  The letter’s official stamp shows a castle, crown and the French phrase Honi soit qui mal y pense, which is used on the royal coat of arms. It translates to “Evil be to him that evil thinks”. The Duke was back behind the wheel within two days of the accident – but without a seat belt. He received “words of advice” from police. Emma told the Sunday Mirror last week that lady-in-waiting Mary Morrison had left a voicemail giving the Queen’s best wishes.  But there was no word from Philip. The good news is that doctors have told Emma her injured wrist is unlikely to need surgery. And despite being a fan of the Royals, she won’t be displaying her letter at home. The mum of two added: “It will just go in a file with all the rest of paperwork on this.” Buckingham Palace last night said the letter was genuine but declined to comment further.

Despite arguably penning the words several days late, it is most remarkable for him to take responsibility. I have no doubt that after his initial shock subsided he would have felt genuine contrition. Renowned for being a man of fierce independence, perhaps we can infer the delay was due to advice on the live police investigation. But as we reach this juncture, it’s fair to say there are no winners.  Buckingham Palace found themselves caught up in a public relations disaster, initially playing down the seriousness of the crash .Even the Queen had to get involved, sending a message to the crash victims as public opinion turned against her husband when he was seen driving a new car on a public road without a seatbelt  hours after the accident. Now, with this admittedly heartfelt letter, perhaps a line will be drawn under the whole saga.   However, serious questions will remain over whether Philip, at , should still be driving. If he admits liability, as seems to be the case as he blames the sun for his lack of vision, then his carelessness could have had dire consequences. As a principled man, perhaps now is the time to hand over the keys and let others take the wheel from here.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have decided to send their daughter to Thomas Battersea in South West London. Prince George, six, has been at the school for two years and now Charlotte will be following in his footsteps. Charlotte will turn four in May and has been attending Willcocks Nursery in Kensington since January .  Now the pair will be going to same school, meaning an easier school drop up for their parents, staff and security, according to the Mail On Sunday. The school offers a range of after-school activities with fencing, gardening and philosophy just a few of the extra-curriculars Charlotte and George can choose from.It comes after it was revealed that Kate and Prince William are thinking about sending Prince George to a less traditional school than Eton, where his dad and Prince Harry went. The proud parents are deliberating sending the future king to Marlborough College - the Duchesss former school - friends of the couple told the Daily Mail .They are reportedly considering the less traditional option for George as they want him to spread his wings as a child.   They wont ever do what people expect them to do when it comes to their children, the source revealed. Both William and Harry went to Eton, where they were able to visit the Queen in Windsor easily, but the couple are reportedly discussing whether the Wiltshire school may be a better environment for George. Eton hasnt been ruled out but they have talked atabout Marlborough as an option and the smart money is on George going there instead, the source said. Marlborough is considered a top boarding school in the UK, and it has incredible sports facilities and grounds.  The pound, per term school seeks a mixed ability intake and the results are good, with  per cent of pupils going on to Oxbridge, latest figures demonstrate. William and Kate have shown they arent afraid to deviate from tradition to make sure Prince George ends up at the option that suits him best. They reportedly surprised friends when they opted for Thomass Battersea over more traditional royal schools, but picked it because they thought it was the right fit for him.

Shes eaten the fanciest meals, visited all corners of the globe and met countless interesting and exciting people. But while her le has been filled with luxury, there are also lots of things being on the throne has meant she missed out on. There are lots of completely normal things that pretty much everyone has done during their lives which the Queen has never had to do.   While some of us would be happy to give up a few of them, others are important milestones treasured by many. Been to school Royals nowdays attend some of the best private schools and universities in the country, with Princes William and Harry proudly boasting Eton educations. But the Queen didnt go to school at all.Instead, she and her sister Princess Margaret were educated at home privately by some of the best tutors money could buy.They studied constitutional history and law to prepare them for their jobs in the royal family.   Even though they received a high quality education, they missed out on classroom learning and never had the chance to make lelong school friends like the rest of us. Taken a driving test Just like passports, drivers licenses are issued in the Queens name - which means she didnt need one. She learned to drive during the Second World War, but she never had to take the test. Shes often seen driving herself around Sandringham in one of her Land Rovers.   Dated As soon as the then Princess Elizabeth laid eyes on the handsome and dashing Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark at the Royal Naval College in Darmouth in , she was head over heels. She was just a teenager when they first met, and although the couple waited until she was  to announce their relationship they were very much in love. Biography Robert Lacy writes: One of the most extraordinary things about the Queen is that she fell in love and married just about the first man she met. Of course, its a slight exaggeration. But she met Prince Philip of Greece, as he then was in  when he was a dashing naval cadet at Dartmouth Naval college.   She had met him before at family occasion, but this was the occasion when, by her own account, the spark was struck. While its a lovely story, it means the Queen missed out on the whole dating game and the opportunity to meet lots of exciting eligible bachelors. Voted Although its not illegal, it is considered unconstitutional for the monarch to vote in any election. As Head of State, the Queen has to remain neutral on all political matters. Although were sure she has her own opinions on whats going on in the House of Commons, she maintains her ceremonial and formal roles. The Queen has weekly meetings with the Prime Minister where she is updated on whats going on and important issues.   Had a - job While the Queen has a very busy schedule filled with state business, Government matters and official engagements, shes never had a normal job. Shes never worked in an office, pulled pints down her local or had to deal with office politics and bitchy colleagues. Had social media Like all members of the Royal Family, privacy is very important to the Queen so like most of her relatives she avoids social media. While some of the younger royals reportedly have secret accounts to stay in touch with their family, its unlikely that the Queen has anything at all.She has however sent a Tweet before during a visit to Londons Science Museum in October .She wrote: It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting.

After lending the book to her next door neighbour and friend Rita*, the pair decided to suggest their idea to their husbands. Kay, who met her husband Robert* when she was  and he was , says she had longed for a night of passion with another man after realising she had no sexual chemistry with her husband. She told the : Id always been loyal to Robert, and he was the only person Id ever slept with. However, secretly I wondered what it would be like with another man. Robert was initially reluctant when he heard the idea, but Ritas husband, Terry , was keen to try it out. Kay and Robert had a son and a daughter of a similar age to Rita and Terrys two daughters, and decided to plan a two-week caravanning holiday with both families.  During the first week, Robert and Rita had a day away together while Kay and Terry looked after the kids. In the second week, it would be Kay and Terrys turn for some fun. But the amorous foursome found they couldnt even wait that long to give swinging a go. While Rita and Robert had checked in to a fancy hotel, Terry and Kay stayed at home looking after the kids.   But caught up in the excitement of it all, Terry and Kay ended up having sex. It started with a passionate kiss and before I knew it, we were in bed. Afterwards, I felt high and giddy, as though Id taken drugs, Kay admits. Then came the caravan holiday, with both couples swapping again for another night of passion. Only, after they got home, things had changed.   Kay explains: Rita and Robert said we needed to talk. They announced they were going to set up home together and all four children would live with them. Kay says she was stunned by the decision, and with nowhere to go and too embarrassed to tell her parents, ended up moving in with Terry. It was eventually agreed that Kays daughter Rachel would come with her, while Terrys youngest daughter also stayed. But while the sex was exciting with Terry, Kay desperately missed her le with Robert.   She says: I tried to make the best of a bad situation. But things got even more dficult when Kay discovered Terry was in debt. The two families became the subject of gossip in their local area. A year after the initial swap, Robert and Rita moved away to the north-west of England while Kay and Terry stayed on the south coast, trying their best to make things work. But Kay says Terry was possessive, and the pair ended up having furious arguments. After seven years, Kay and Terry admitted defeat and split up.   Kay focused on rebuilding her le with Rachel, although didnt have much contact with her son. Rachel didnt speak to her father much, we left the family completely split down the middle. Kay says: Now, at  years old, I still think about the we swap and all the hurt it caused. Although I didnt love Robert, we had created a stable home for our children to grow up in. But the we swap split Rachel and her brother apart, and ruined Rachel’s relationship with her father.

This meant she was forced to have a hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy when the blunder was realised after  months. She believes the ordeal could have been avoidedher test results had been read correctly back in . The removal of her womb means Hayley, who always dreamed of having two children, she is now infertile. Hayley began suffering unusual bleeding and eventually paid for a second opinion from a private consultant. She had her hysterectomy eight days later, underwent five weeks of radiotherapy and  hours of gruelling chemotherapy.  She said: I feel like a totally dferent person since my diagnosis and it has been incredibly dficult trying to come to terms with how my le has been turned upside down. Simple things that many people take for granted are now a real struggle. Even walking can be painful. I used to enjoy exercise and would go to the gym around six times a week but even moderate exercise now can leave me in agony for days after. One of the worst things has been trying to come to terms with the fact that I cannot have any children. I was always dreamed of having two children. It is dficult not to feel angry at what happened but I want to try and focus on the future.  I just hope that the hospital trust realises the impact its error has had on my le and learns lessons to improve patient care. By speaking out I hope other women realise how important it is that they recognise the signs of cervical cancer and seek medical advice at the earliest opportunity. Hayley had a smear test in October  at her GP surgery. The test was sent to University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust for analysis, and the results coming back as negative. Hayley was invited for a routine follow up test in a further three years. But in May  she visited AE at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after she suffered heavy bleeding for more than a week. In November  Hayley once again visited her GP complaining of bleeding, including after going to the gym. Her GP referred her to a private consultant who raised suspicions and sent her for tests including a biopsy.  She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in December  and had a hysterectomy eight days later. Hayley had previously travelled the world with her job as a service delivery manager but was forced to quit after her diagnosis. She now works for a bank but continues to suffer back, pelvis and hip pain, as well as fatigue and chronic swelling in her thighs caused by a build-up of fluid from her radiotherapy. Hayley, of Kings Norton, Birmingham, is now in remission and has instructed medical negligence lawyers Irwin Mitchell to investigate her case. Her lawyer Emma Rush said: The last couple of years have been extremely upsetting for Hayley as continues to try to come to terms with her diagnosis and the effects of her treatment, sadly including that she will not be able to have children. We believe thatHayleys tests results had been recorded correctly she would have received urgent appropriate treatment, which would have avoided her hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  We now call on the trust to ensure it learns lessons from this case so other women do not have to go through the anger and upset Hayley has had to endure following her diagnosis. Cervical cancer is a treatable disease with a good long term prognosis when it is diagnosed early. It is important women continue to attend regular smear appointments and be aware of the symptoms, andneeded, seek medical advice at the earliest possible opportunity. University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for analysing the original smear test results, admitted that Hayleys smear test was interpreted incorrectly. A hospital spokesperson said: The admission has been made by the trust that on this occasion Ms Wareing did not receive the care she could have reasonably expected. We are working with Ms Wareings representatives to achieve an appropriate resolution of the litigation. The trust always strives to deliver the safest and most appropriate care to all of our patients and cascades the learnings from cases such as this one.

Murrayfield Terrace.A number of the one and two-storey homes would be adapted for tenants with disabilities as well as for those with additional needs.The homes would be the first “in-house” developed

Clansman runs fantastic boat trips, but not everyone wants to go on a boat so we want to bring other visitor experiences to the loch.\"We approached the distillery. They think itrsquos a great idea and we think its a great idea and of course it will be a great means of promoting their product.\"He added: \"We get lots of bus tours from Invergordon to the hotel and this development will also help reduce traffic and help the environment because it means they will not have to spend half a day on the road travelling to a whisky experience where.\"GlenWyvis managing director John Mckenzie said: \"This opportunity has come at the perfect time for GlenWyvis. It will give us access to a global audience and it will provide a great forum to engage with visitors who are interested in the story of whisky from a Highland community perspective. This is about the story of grass-roots distilling, distilling for the people, and, of course, that is what underpins the community ethos of GlenWyvis.\"The aim is to have the new visitor attraction up and running by this summer but to develop it further after that, providing both interactive and interpretative displays, as well as a retail facility.Sunday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119378.jpg","title":"Call for Inverness to get a share of cash for shop conversions","story":"CONCERNS have been raised that Inverness could be denied a share of funding to help the hardest-pressed local high streets turn empty shops into housing.Mike Smith, manager of the cityrsquos Business Improvement Districtfears a move by the Federation of Small Businessesto persuade the Scottish Government to split a pound million fund between the poorest-performing high streets only could see a relatively buoyant Inverness miss out.ldquoI donrsquot think thatrsquos fair, he said.ldquoAll high streets are under certain pressures.

lending service has helped shape the city.A new booklet highlights the service’s  permanent buildings as well as community libraries and reading rooms that no longer exist.The first site in the city was the Central Library, on Rosemount Viaduct, which opened in  and its success with the public prompted an increasing demand for more to be available across the city.To satisfy the need, a reading room was opened in March  on the first floor of the former Town House in Old Aberdeen, followed by Torry and Ferryhill branches in December .Another reading room opened in September  at  Castle Street

Powis Community Centre got a new library and offered residents the luxury of reading newspapers for free.Unfortunately, the provision of the newspapers declined, before the site was eventually shut in

city-run libraries are Central Library, Airyhall, Bridge of Don, Bucksburn, Cornhill, Cove, Culter, Cults, Dyce, Ferryhill, Kaimhill, Kincorth, Mastrick, Northfield, Tillydrone, Torry and Woodside.Over the years, the city has also said goodbye to a number of branches, including Old Aberdeen, which closed in April  and Linksfield, which was adjoined to the academy and shut in .As well

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

In summary, Mr Anstee explained, not a lot had changed since an earlier report, though a lot of remedial work would be needed.Mr Anstee added that the question is: #What use to people want to make of the hall  Do we need it at all #The next question is whether the hall should be demolished and a new facility built or whether the facade should be retained # for which heritage grant funding may be available. A sense of frustration was evident in the hall as people heard about surveys and consultation # a familiar theme for Inspire Inveraray since its formation three years ago.Hotelier Donald Clark clearly wants to see action and is not keen on retaining the old building. He said: #It#s an eyesore. I think we need to work on the premise of demolition then decide on the use of it.#Next it was on to the vexed question of Inveraray Pier. Numerous attempts to start a dialogue with the owner Archie MacArthur had failed, said Mr Anstee.One approach Inspire Inveraray is looking at is to attempt to purchase the pier using community Right to Buy legislation. There is also the question of whether to bid for the puffer, which Mr MacArthur is trying to sell, as well as the pier itself.To get to the bottom of the community#s views, consultant Charlotte Lee has been employed to pull together opinions and draw up a community action plan.Of only slightly lesser importance is the telephone box in Church Square, in which Inspire Inveraray has expressed an interest. If BT agrees to hand it over, the next question is what to do with it.The many questions highlighted during the evening in connection with the community centre, pier and even the phonebox will be condensed into a straightforward questionnaire to be handed round Inveraray homes with the help of Inveraray Community Council.Anyone wishing to contribute their views or help with the consultation can contact Charlotte Lee on info@cslconsultancy.net or call  ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 30","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt does not matter how lovely, docile and well mannered your dog is.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

Gaenor, who joins Heathfield after heading up Dalmilling Primary for five years, said: “I was very happy there and only Heathfield would have pulled me away. “It is always the school I have aspired to.

I’ve never been at a school where the surroundings in the community are so rich.” Gaenor cut her teaching teeth in south London before ing north after her sister suffered a severe stroke, aged just . She said: “It made me review my le and decide what was important so we relocated back up to Scotland. “I’ve been back here for  years now and always had one eye on Heathfield as I knew it was such an exciting job. “Part of that excitement is that I live in the catchment and my children went here so it feels like coming home. “But I’m also excited about making this the flagship school. “However, we also need to make this the hub of the local community.” Fitness fanatic Gaenor admits an “open and frank exchange of views” took place during the first meeting with her new parent council last week. It follows concerns over the previous management’s approach to alleged bullying within the school. But she insisted: “I’m all for honest, vibrant and lively dialogue. “None of it was a surprise to me as a parent myself. “I would hate to think I’ll be a comparison to previous management in the school. “What I can bring is my own unique experience to the role. “I want to be open and visible and have parents approach me. “This has to be us together on the journey.” And she added: “I don’t have to grow a passion for the school.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

According to the Natural History Museum, the dinosaur would have walked on fingers and toes. Dippys rear legs are even larger: each thigh bone is one-and-a-half-metreslong.Mirroring the neck, Dippys tail curves another seven metresbackwards. Scientists believe it might have been used to make a noise like a whip as a defence against predators.Interestingly, Dippys tail has a series of coat hanger-shaped bones hanging at regular intervals, designed to support and protect the blood vessels. Their distinct shape is what gives the species ndash diplodocus ndash its name, meaning \"double-beamed\".The colour of a fossil typically depends on what minerals replace the bone over time. The original excavated skeleton looks dark brown, so Dippy was painted in a similar shade.Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian in Glasgow University, is delighted to see Dippy arrive in Scotland.\"Andrew Carnegie was originally from Scotland and this is a dinosaur that was named after a Scotsman,\" he says. \"Carnegie had the cast made for the British people so it is nice that it is finally going on tour and that everyone will have the opportunity to see it.\"It may be a replica rather than real bones, yet this matters not a jot, insists Clark. \"Being a cast doesnt mean that it is a fake,\" he says. \"It is quite a precise copy of the bones and people will see the actual size of the skeleton.\"Clark, who is also president of the Geological Society of Glasgow, is looking forward to seeing it capture the publics imagination and shine a spotlight on Scotlands rich fossil heritage.\"Everybody loves a good dinosaur story and I hope that we can let people know a lot more about our Scottish links with dinosaurs,\" he says.Fossils from the Middle Jurassic period, roughly  million to  million years ago, are extremely rare and Skye is one of the few places in the world where they can be found.Over the past three decades Clark has been a regular visitor to Skye, which has earned a reputation as Scotlands dinosaur isle. He is a member of the PalAlba collaboration made up of palaeontologists, geoscientists and other related experts in this field.\"Dinosaurs in Scotland are very important worldwide,\" he says. \"A lot of people may not realise how important they are. The dinosaurs in Scotland are from a time period from which very few dinosaurs are known. They are also at a time when dinosaurs ersy greatly.\"It is a very important time period: the Middle Jurassic. Even in North America there are no dinosaur bones known from that time period.\"Scotlands first dinosaur remains ndash a single footprint ndash were discovered on the Trotternish peninsula by Dr Julian Andrews and Professor John Hudson in . The cmprint is believed to have been made by an iguanodon-like ornithopod.A decade passed before the next discovery. Then they came thick and fast. In , German collector Matthias Metz discovered a small fossilised partial tibia of a bipedal theropod near Elgol in the south of Skye.Around the same time, Lachlan Scott-Moncrieff found a fragment of bone near his home in Staffin that turned out to be from a sauropod ndash four-legged, herbivorous dinosaurs.BP geologists Dr Doug Boyd and Dr John Dixon came across a more substantial sauropod bone on the foreshore at Valtos near Staffin in .There have been bones broken too ndash certainly for Clark, who fractured his leg soon after discovering Skyes second ever set of footprints in .He had gathered a team to remove the prints from a limestone block at Port Earlish when disaster struck. Vibrations from a pneumatic drill shattered Clarks tibia and fibula in multiple places requiring him to be airlted from the beach by helicopter and rushed for emergency surgery.Yet, it didnt put him off. A few months later Clark ed to Skye ndash on crutches ndash to lead a group of geologists and there, he found a tailbone of a theropod dinosaur. \"I have mixed feelings about that year,\" he laughs.In , Clark alongside Dugald Ross, who owns the Staffin Dinosaur Museum, and hotelier Paul Booth, discovered a trackway of  to  footprints at An Corran beach. The three-toed impressions are thought to have been made by a family of megalosaurus  million years ago.Another of Clarks most prized Skye specimens has pride of place in the Hunterian: the worlds smallest dinosaur footprint. Believed to belong to a theropod, the .cmprint is similar in size to that of a blackbird. He also found the first theropod tooth on Skye at Valtos in .More recently, Clark uncovered the first evidence that dinosaurs walked on the Scottish mainland. That discovery happened last March while he was retracing the steps of his great, great grandfather, who had been part of the Scottish Gold Rush in .Next month he will be hosting a \"Rock Doctors\" fossil-themed workshop as part of a programme of events and activities being run by Glasgow Museums to mark Dippys stay at Kelvingrove.There will be another important visitor too: a Tyrannosaurus Rex will go on show at Kelvin Hall in Glasgow this April. The -million-year-old skeleton ndash known as Trix ndash is on loan from the Naturalis Bioersity Centre in Leiden, Netherlands.Dating back to the Cretaceous period, the dinosaur was excavated in Montana in . Trix ndash named after the former Dutch queen Beatrix ndash is one of only three complete T. rex skeletons known to exist anywhere in the world.The exhibition is being co-organised by the Hunterian and Glasgow Museums. \"It will be the first time I have seen a complete mounted skeleton of a T. rex. I have seen bits and pieces of T. rex before, but I havent seen a complete reconstructed one,\" says Clark.\"The other interesting thing is that the little vertebrae I found back in  may be from a primitive tyrannosaur. It may be that Scotland is the birthplace of the tyrannosaur.\"Dippy On Tour: A Natural History Adventure is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow until May .T. rex in Town opens at Kelvin Hall on April  and runs until July .

It does not stand or fall on the popularity of inidual politicians or the policies of a single political party. This is not about a cult of personality, which is an empty rebuke devoid of any intellectual merit that some opponents have used to denigrate the Yes movement. It also insults ordinary supporters of independence and their families.Already, after the y and serious charges being faced by Alex Salmond were published, some people are seeking to make political capital. Mr Salmond has strenuously denied all of the charges and his innocence or guilt will be established in a court of law. This, though, wonrsquot stop ill-advised and ignorant speculation about the implications for the independence movement.The wider movement for independence will eventually succeed or fail by how many people like me, who hail from traditional Labour-supporting communities, it can persuade to join it. The polls that emerged at the start of the referendum campaign in  all indicated that support for independence was running at around %. This showed that there would probably never be enough lsquospiritualrsquo SNP supporters to deliver independence now or in the foreseeable future. That the Yes vote increased by around % in less than two years stemmed from several factors. For me, as I suspect it was for many from a similar background, the migration to self-determination was as much about the creeping values of neo-liberalism and profit-at-any-cost that had begun to dominate political Conservatism as it was about any emotional attachment to an independent Scotland.You might reasonably counter with the claim that neo-liberalism and profiteering have always found a welcome in the fortresses of UK political Conservatism. In the last decade or so, however, it became possible to witness a kind of genetic transmutation of traditional Conservatism into something more malevolent and toxic.Following the  banking crisis many on the left observed the ways in which the UK political elite tried to mitigate its effects. This rested on a desire to protect big capital with tax breaks and lax scrutiny and to penalise the far greater many who had endured the worst of its effects. To ensure that such a strategy flew without close inspection by those it was designed to hurt some culprits had to be provided. Thus lsquoexcessiversquo immigration and the lsquounaccountablersquo bureaucrats of the EU were identied before being tried and found guilty in the pages of the English right-wing press, which now passes for the highest court of jurisdiction in this new hard-right ideology. For the first time many Labour supporters began to look more favourably upon the idea of an independent Scotland as offering a long-term escape route from a society that seemed to have lost all sense of a moral bearing. After independence we could shake the SNPrsquos hand send them on their way with a nice clock to recognise their long service and then set about the task of ushering in an authentic socialist republic.In the five years that have elapsed since I opted for an independent Scotland Irsquove not been its most reliable role model. I was not emotionally scarred by the outcome of the referendum. Faith, family, friendship and even old football allegiances all remained higher in my list of priorities than the struggle for an independent Scotland. Independence was a preference rather a moral imperative. I still consider myself to be an Old Labour type and do not foresee any circumstances under which I would vote for the SNP, a party which still harbours too many right-wing types and Mickey Mouse liberals for my taste. The circumstances of Brexit and the conduct of those tasked with delivering it, however, have intensied my emotional commitment to an independent Scotland.The fact that Scotland is increasingly likely to be dragged out of the EU in less than nine weeks with no viable deal, and against the overwhelmingly settled will of its citizens, initially raised obvious questions about the value of Scotlands democratic institutions. This has been accompanied throughout the last two years with a disdain bordering on outright contempt for our parliament and for those elected representatives who, like me, believe that a measure of sovereignty resides in it.Worse than this, though, as testied by events of the last few weeks, is the outright dishonesty of some of the chief Brexiters who are revealed to have been on the take from institutions with a direct interest in leaving the EU. The dangerous lies about immigration found fertile ground in empty minds and, recognising such, the UK Government is making plans for military intervention on the streets of mainland Britain. The Prime Minister is sacricing the entire economic future of this country and risking serious civil unrest to placate the whims of  Ulster medievalists. These are people who awake each day hoping that they will be caught up in the Rapture that will portend the second coming of Jesus.We are dealing with a country that has succumbed to the law of the economic jungle and where the chief architects of this are now openly mocking the rest of us as they move their fortunes offshore. If violence erupts on Englandrsquos streets we can be certain of one thing: they will be on the first Learjets out of here. In Scotland we will have one last opportunity to establish something better and more human. Itrsquos now not merely a matter of moral necessity but one of self-respect. And when self-respect goes you will permit anything to be done in your name."},{"url":null,"title":"ex-labour-mp-suspended-over-remarks-on-jewish-community-reinstated-to-party","story":"Jim Sheridan, a former Paisley and Renfrewshire North MP who is now a councillor in Renfrewshire, said he is \"delighted\" with the decision and his support for Labour will continue.The party launched an investigation following a complaint in August last year, reported to relate to a social media post in which he spoke about his loss of \"respect and empathy\" for the community amid the anti-Semitism row.In a statement issued on Friday, he reiterated his apology while calling his accusers \"misguided\".He said: \"Today I was notied that my suspension from the Labour Party has been lted with no further action to be taken by the party.\"Whilst I am delighted with this decision, I remain of the view that my accusers were misguided and overreacted to what was intended to highlight my personal frustration and criticism of those intent on undermining our leadership in Scotland and the UK.\"I would also like to reiterate my sincere apologies to the Jewish community whose historic struggle I have supported all my political le.\"Mr Sheridan said he had been \"humbled\" by the level of support he received.He added: \"Throughout this unfortunate distraction I have maintained my total commitment to my constituents and will continue to do so.\"Likewise my complete support for the Labour Party and our leaderships at every level continues, and reinforces my determination toLabour administrations at local, devolved and national level, for the many not the few.\"It is understood Mr Sheridan will be issued with a reminder of party conduct.A Labour Party spokesman said: \"The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.\"All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-analysis-why-claims-of-an-indyref2-mandate-are-political-hot-air","story":"Nicola Sturgeonrsquos ideal backdrop for her imminent announcement on the timetable for indyref is not dficult to imagine. Growing support in the polls. A bit of political momentum. And nothing disastrous lurking around the corner.A potential trial involving her predecessor and mentor, who has been charged with multiple counts of attempted rape and indecent assault, hardly meets the criteria and will inevitably provide the SNP leadership with sleepless nights.But the impact of the Salmond case on Scotlandrsquos constitutional future should not be over-stated. The former SNP leader is a political has-been who took an axe to his own reputation when he agreed to work for a Putin propaganda station. His supporters are not swing voters they will back Yes regardless of the facts.Sturgeon faces referendum roadblocks far more formidable than the Salmond case, particularly over her delay in revamping the case for independence and, critically, explaining the process by which she intends to deliver another plebiscite.The First Ministerrsquos line has been to claim she has a ldquocast iron mandate for a referendum. A combination of her partyrsquos victory at the last Holyrood election, Parliament endorsing a second vote, as well the SNP winning a majority of MPs in , turned it into a ldquotriple lock mandate.However, a \"mandate is a rhetorical device that has no basis in law. In politics, the only mandate a party can secure from voters is the right to bring forward a policy for parliamentary scrutiny. An initiative may be pushed through, rejected, or tweaked, but there is no such thing as automatic implementation based on an election victory.A mandate must also reflect the powers of the legislature. The SNP could win the next Holyrood election on the basis of demanding a poundbn funding top up from Westminster, but Theresa May would be under no obligation to hand over the money. You cannot force another Government to do something.Let us suspend reality and pretend Holyrood does have the power to organise another referendum unilaterally. In ,  SNP MSPs - a minority - were elected on the basis that the Parliament should have this ldquorightthere was a ldquomaterial change such as ldquoScotland being taken out the EU against our will.However, the pro-independence Scottish Green MSPs did not sign up to this form of words ahead of the poll. Patrick Harviersquos party instead suggested indyref should be triggered by a petition being signed by an ldquoappropriate number of voters. This has not happened. Only by ignoring the Green manesto and pretending they made the same commitment as the Nationalists can you conjure a credible majority at Holyrood.Some of the more adventurous Nationalists would like Holyrood to ignore Westminster and legislate for a Catalonia-style referendum. But anyone with a basic understanding of Sturgeonrsquos cautious political instincts understands this will not happen. She has no ambitions to become Scotlandrsquos Clara Ponsati.The importance of the Edinburgh Agreement, which Sturgeon helped draw up, was not whether such a bilateral deal was legally required. What it confirmed was that a legitimate referendum must be based on the consent of both sides. Without such a partnership you are left with a ldquowildcat referendum, legal challenges and a boycott from the No side. No sensible person in the Yes movement would favour this move.Sturgeon also faces the problem of an increasingly restless pro-independence movement. A senior Yesser told me two groups currently co-exist in the ldquoindy coalition. ldquoYou have activists whose priority, above all , is to have another independence referendum, he said. ldquoBut you have wiser heads whose priority is to win a referendum.A primary reason behind Yes losing in  was the inability of the pro-independence side to reach out to soft No voters and speak their political language. Some activists made no attempt others were simply contemptuous of their opponents.I attended Yes events during the campaign for news-gathering purposes and my notebooks are littered with examples of aggressive speeches and contributions that persuaded nobody.Here are a selection of the descriptions by speakers and audience members on the UK: ldquowar-mongering ldquoeconomically bankrupt and ldquofailed imperial state. Labour supporters were dismissed as ldquored Tories and the BBC was either ldquobiased or a ldquodisgrace.Some of the hustings were open-mic, rather than open mind, and marked by apocalyptic warnings that only appealed to people who were already furious. Nuance was a foreign country and subtlety a stranger. Many of the same folk are now demanding Sturgeon immediately delivers indyref.The First Minister knows, deep down, there is only one narrow road that can take her to a second referendum. The SNP and the Greens would need to win a majority of seats in  on an explicit promise of another vote. Such an outcome would not constitute a ldquomandate, but it would put maximum pressure on the UK Government.

Even once all these Nazi genocide survivors have died, the day will not lose its living voice. For genocide still pulses across the world.The living voice of International Holocaust Remembrance Day is there in the survivors of the many genocides that have happened in recent decades. No other recent genocide may have taken so many lives, but all have been as horrying and bewildering in their atrocity.Many of these voices are still young. Among them, for instance, visiting Scotland this weekend is -year-old Fareeda Abbas, a Yazidi woman who, like Nadia Murad, last yearrsquos winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is a survivor from Kojo, a village massacred by Islamic State.On August , , Islamic State soldiers gathered all of the people from her village in the school building and asked them to convert to Islam ndash then, when they rejected that, they began killing the men,  over the course of one day, including her father and two of her brothers.For four months, Abbas was held in captivity, raped, beaten, forced to watch an eight-year-old girl being raped. At one point her injuries were so bad she could hardly move or see. After several attempts at escape, on the third she succeeded.Abbas is one of the key driving forces in Yazda, a charity that aims to prevent future genocides against the Yazidi community and other minorities, and to assist them in recovery. Recently it held a fundraiser in Edinburgh, organised by a Scot who had been affected by their story. It was a reminder that the Yazidi plight must not be forgotten.Thousands of Yazidi women are still imprisoned by Isis. Around , Yazidi were killed, and many more fled to refugee camps. It is a community so broken its survival depends on international support.Meanwhile, there are the voices of the Rohingya, around , of whom were killed in Myanmar in , and , are currently living across camps in Coxrsquos Bazar.There is also Sudan, where hundreds of thousands of Darfuris have been killed under Omar al-Bashirrsquos genocidal regime, and the many other countries, where according to Genocide Watch, there is a genocide emergency.But genocide doesnrsquot pop up from nowhere. We can see it coming. The Genocide Watch site lists around  countries which are already at what it describes as the ldquoextermination stage of genocide, and many more that are involved in polarisation or other processes which it outlines as leading up to mass murder.Never again, we say. But then we look around the word and see that here it is again, and again. If we want to know what wersquove learned in the  years since Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated, we need only look at how we have reacted to these recent genocides and what the international community has failed to do. These are the people we should think about most on International Holocaust Memorial Day ndash the people still in the grip of horror, or aftermath, the people who need support.Above all, though, this day should provide fuel to a fight against the hatred, polarisation and dehumanisation that, according to Genocide Watch, are preconditions for genocide. These are as present as ever across the world, perhaps on the rise.In this climate, it seems that more than ever we need to listen to the words of Nazi death march survivor Harry Spiro: ldquoI came to the conclusion a long time ago that hating people doesnrsquot achieve anything. People are capable of doing horrendous things to each other, but that isnrsquot overcome by yet more hate.Sharing in mob justiceYou only have to look at some of the responses online to the fact that former Shameless star Tina Malone is being prosecuted for contempt of court for sharing an image of someone said to be Jon Venables to realise that vigilantism is alive and well in the British public. For, it seems that plenty are out to support Malone, not just because they think the possibility of her being jailed is ridiculous and would represent a step too far ndash which is fair enough ndash but because they think she was quite right to share the Venables picture and that he should indeed be exposed.Mob justice seemed to be the mood of the day, with a general feeling pervading that Venables would deserve whatever came to him. Few were the voices saying, this is the law and the kind of restrictions we need in order to live in a civilised society where justice isnrsquot meted out by crowds baying for blood. But Malones fame makes her a particularly good example to pursue for this sharing, which was done by many others.The trial no doubt will gain much attention. Surely, after this, no one will be able to share Venablersquos identity, and say, as she did, ldquoI am not au fait with the law."},{"url":null,"title":"why-venezuela-is-the-one-to-watch","story":"THE rousing lyrics of the national anthem said it all. ldquoOff with the chains! Off with the chains!, they sang as one voice in the streets of Caracas last Wednesday. Just moments earlier, constitution in hand, Juan Guaido, standing before tens of thousands of his supporters had taken the oath declaring himself president of Venezuela.No sooner had he done so than news broke of the United Statesrsquo recognition of Guaido as the interim president and a short time later a whole raft of Latin American countries, notably allies of Washington, duly followed suit.It all might have had a feeling of spontaneity, but watching the dramatic events unfold last week in Venezuela one was left with the persistent impression that so much of what was unfolding was all very carefully orchestrated.By Friday, in a leafy square in the Caracas neighbourhood of Chacao, Guaido ndash now the de facto opposition leader to incumbent president Nicolas Maduro ndash was urging Venezuelarsquos armed forces to ldquocome over to the side of the people to bring about fresh elections and ato democracy.As every day passes the distinct whf of regime change becomes ever stronger in Venezuela, leaving this giant Latin American country at an uncertain political crossroads and one not without some considerable danger.Even the timing of last weekrsquos resurgence in the countryrsquos opposition to Maduro seemed to have been worked out to the day. It came during a highly symbolic date for Venezuelans, as they marked the st anniversary of a civilian and military uprising that overthrew former Venezuelan dictator General Marcos Perez Jimenez back in .So is history repeating itself and is Maduro, widely regarded as a dictator, about to be ousted, or will he, as some suggest, hang on with the help of the countryrsquos all-powerful military Venezuelarsquos journey to this volatile political juncture has been a rocky one to say the least. For his part, Maduro has continued the huge social welfare programmes and price control policies of previous Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who steered the country toward socialism before dying in .But a crash in the price of crude oil in  was the catalyst for Venezuelarsquos woes, with the cost of a barrel dropping from nearly  to . This coincided with nearly a decade of mismanagement, as the countryrsquos government squandered its phenomenal oil wealth. Today, oil production has declined to barely one-third of the level a decade ago.At the same time, inflation has soared, and the International Monetary Fund predicts it will reach a staggering  million per cent this year.The crisis has left Latin America reeling from an unprecedented mass exodus of Venezuelan migrants in search of food. About . million people have fled the crisis since , according to the United Nations, while those among the  million Venezuelans left behind face failing public services including water, electricity and transport.Last week, it seemed like their patience had finally run out, and buoyed by the appearance of a new leader in the shape of telegenic congressional chief Guaido, many seemed ready to face down the Maduro regime.Such a stance, of course, has been music to the ears of those in the US administration of President Donald Trump who have been gunning for Maduro for some time. As far back as the summer of , Trump, citing George HW Bushrsquos - invasion of Panama as a positive precedent, repeatedly pushed his national security staff to launch a military assault on crisis-plagued Venezuela.According to reports in the American weekly magazine The Nation, Trump wanted to know why the United States could simply not invade  Time and again in meetings with senior staff he is said to have brought up the idea.While military and civilian advisers, are said to have forcefully dismissed the notion Trump then outsourced Venezuela policy to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who, along with National Security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began co-ordinating with the Venezuelan opposition.Indeed, prior to being appointed Secretary of State, Pompeo, former director of the CIA in , was already on the record as admitting that he wasldquohopeful that there can be a transition in Venezuela.The CIA he said was ldquotrying to help themunderstand the things they might do so that they can get a better outcome for their part of the world and our part of the world.CIA meddling in Latin America, of course, is nothing new, making it easier for Maduro to point the finger at Washington and casting those it supports in Venezuela as nothing more than American puppets.Almost immediately after Washingtonrsquos recognition of Guaido last week Maduro broke off relations with the US, giving its diplomats until this weekend to leave and ordering Venezuelan diplomats tohome by the same deadline. Not surprisingly, Madurorsquos reliable allies in the shape of China, Cuba, Bolivia, and Turkey then rallied in their backing for the president, none more so than Russia.ForCuba was the Kremlinrsquos closest ally in Latin America during the Cold War, these days itrsquos Venezuela, whose still vast oil wealth gives Moscow direct influence over an Opec member.That Madurorsquos predecessor and mentor Chavez was stridently anti-American made Venezuela the ideal partner in the eyes of Russian president Vladimir Putin.According to an investigation by the Reuters news agency, the Kremlin is deeply invested in the survival of Madurorsquos regime, having sunk both political and financial capital into Venezuela. Russia is said to have propped up the countryrsquos rulers with at least  billion in loans and credit lines since , often taking oil assets in . For obvious reasons then Moscow is far from happy about what one Russian official government newspaper described as the US ldquocarrying out a classic coup drsquoetat in Venezuela.According to an exclusive report by Reuters, the contractors are associated with the so-called Wagner group whose members, mostly ex-service personnel, fought clandestinely in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine.The story cites Yevgeny Shabayev, the head of the Khovrino Cossack organisation, who has his own background as a mercenary and routinely speaks to the international press about such activities as well as anonymous sources.ldquoOur people are there directly for his protection, Shabayev told Reuters, adding that the mercenaries were there specically to prevent rogue members of Venezuelarsquos security forces from detaining Maduro. He also claimed that Wagner had around  iniduals in the country.Citing contacts in a Russian state security organisation, Shabayev claims the Russian contingent flew to Venezuela at the start of last week, a few days before opposition protests to Maduro started.He said they set off in two chartered aircraft for Havana, Cuba, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to Venezuela. While verying such claims remains dficult, the report,accurate, would underline the extent to which Russia is concerned over the latest development in Venezuela and the potential of the crisis to draw in outside forces.For the moment, most observers agreethat the direction in which the crisis travels in the coming days and the fate of Maduro and his rival Guaido will very much depend on the reaction of Venezuelarsquos own military.Showing considerable astuteness, Guaido has tried to break the strong bonds that tie the army and Maduro by offering an amnesty to any personnel in the ,-strong armed forces who disavow the president.Addressing members of the military last week before renewed street protests, Guaido said: ldquoWersquore not asking you to launch a coup drsquoetat, wersquore not asking you to shoot. Wersquore asking you not to shoot at us.On Friday, at a news conference, he went even further in efforts to appease the army. ldquoI want to insist, to our military family, our brothers, the moment has arrived for you to put yourselves on the side of the constitution, Guaido appealed.Whether the army that is also supported by some . million civilian militiamen listens to Guaidorsquos offers is crucial in determining whether Maduro stays in office or the country makes a peaceful transition of power. Earlier last week, before the streets protests and Guaido declared himself interim president, there was a small uprising on a Caracas military outpost by low-ranking National Guard officers, that some thought might mark the start of a sht in the militaryrsquos position but nothing has followed since. But not all are convinced.ldquoA sergeant at a National Guard outpost is not to me important, what would be important is a situation like that in a major unit or a battalion, observed Rocio San Miguel, a military expert with non-profit group Citizen Control, speaking of the uprising. In the main, opinions of analysts on which way the armed forces will jumpat all remain mixed. Some suggest there are subtle indications they may, for the first time, be reconsidering their ironclad support for Maduro.ldquoWhat I think we are seeing is a security system and armed forces that are still trying to figure out where they are on this issue, William Brownfield, a former US ambassador to Venezuela, told the Washington Post on Friday.The point on which most analysts agree, however, is that soldiers have multiple reasons to be angry. Military installations are steadily decaying along with the rest of the country, and salaries quickly disappear amid two million per cent annual inflation.Rights organisations say that around  soldiers were arrested in  for conspiring against the government, while , more deserted the National Guard.More than aware of the potential threat that lurks within the military to his government, Maduro has played his own card to keep the army on side, putting officers in charge of key posts in the government and state oil company PDVSA while offering lucrative oilfield services contracts for military-linked firms.So far, over the past week, the armed forces have been unusually restrained in dealing with the political crisis.Not only did they refrain from launching an all-out offensive against massive anti-government demonstrations ndash although  people have been killed in recent days ndash but they have also not arrested Guaido.According to the New York Times, factions of army officers who have already defected say they are plotting s from their makesht headquarters in Peru, Colombia and other neighbouring countries. The Trump administration is also said to have held secret meetings with rebellious Venezuela military officers over the last year to discuss their plans for the overthrow of Maduro, according to American officials and a former Venezuelan military commander who participated in the talks.But not all within Venezuelarsquos militaryrsquos ranks view Washington in a favourable light, far from it. A resilient anti-American ideology remains and in some cases was no doubt inadvertently bolstered last week by Washingtonrsquos eagerness to back Guaido. ldquoThese are guys that fought with Chavez, that believe in their hearts that the US is the enemy, says Eva Golinger, a Venezuelan-American lawyer and author of Confidante Of \"Tyrants\" who is also an outspoken supporter of the late Venezuelan leader.Sixty years ago, when Venezuelans took to the streets, the then dictatorship collapsed in the face of surging protests.But demonstrations alone didnrsquot bring down Venezuelarsquos strongman back then. Only when the military stepped in, with tanks alongside protesters, did the dictatorship fall. That sobering fact is something that not only ordinary Venezuelans are acutely aware of but also self-declared interim president Juan Guaido and those in Washington who have given him their blessing and support.For that simple historical precedent alone, in the days ahead all eyes will be on Venezuelarsquos army, for itrsquos in their hands that the future political direction of the country almost certainly now lies."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-did-top-secret-pentagon-stargate-letter-convince-senator-john-mccain-alien-invasion-was-imminent","story":"Despite its rather outreacute nature, this tale is no urban myth ndash although some details have been embellished over the years. One retelling even has Reagan weeping on Spielbergrsquos shoulder as ET ldquowent home. Having since confirmed the event indeed took place, the legendary director has also admitted he remains unsureReagan was being honest with his guests ndash or simply pulling off deadpan surrealism better than Rikki Fulton or Jacob Rees-Mogg.One thing is incontrovertibly true ndashRonald Reagan had intimate knowledge of extra-terrestrial visitations to Earth, then he certainly knew they werenrsquot friendly, doe-eyed botanists. Without even taking his bizarre satellite-laser ldquoStar Wars missile defence system into consideration, Reaganrsquos numerous mentions of aliens in speeches marked him as a blatant UFO-nut hiding in plain sight. One turning a blind eye to the Pentagon burning through tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating ldquoforeign advanced aerospace weapons.Yet,such research ndash carried out under dferent guises by the US military since Project Blue Book in the s ndash was simply to ascertain the threat from traditional Russian or Chinese bogeymen, then it seems they were a wee bit more technologically advanced than previously thought.This week, the Pandorarsquos Box of top secret Pentagon documents was declassied under a Freedom of Information request ndash a single five-page letter containing the titles of a bewildering litany of otherworldly research papers commissioned from scientists around the globe.The titles of these academic studies certainly donrsquot concur with commonly accepted Russian technical malevolence like vote rigging and web trolling. Certainly, research into invisibility cloaking, dark energy, stargates, multidimensional manipulation, meta-materials, laser weapons, quantum entanglement and ldquocontrolling external devices in the absence of limb-operated interfaces seems more like a Philip K Dick fever dream.If nothing , the document ndash addressed primarily to the office of late Senator and former pilot John McCain, who also had a considerable interest in colourful accounts of unusual aviation ndash certainly proves the Pentagon had been trying to get their heads around the true nature of a somewhat peculiar security threat. And unless the Russians or Chinese have torn a wormhole through the fabric of spacetime with a laser weapon recently, it wasnrsquot them.Uni lateral thinkingTHE exotic nature of some of the research papers commissioned by the US militaryrsquos Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Programwould raise a quizzical eyebrow on even Vladmir Putinrsquos Botox-irrigated deathmask.Itrsquos certainly reaffirmed the suspicions of the global Ufology community, who only learned of the research papers existence last week after the AATIP letter ended up on the desk of Nick Pope, ex-head of the UK Governmentrsquos official UFO research project. Colloquially known as Britianrsquos ldquoFox Mulder, the affable Nick immediately teased true believers on Twitter with some ambiguous speculation, saying: ldquoIt still doesnrsquot give us a definitive answer to whether, as claimed, lsquoforeign advanced aerospace weapon threatsrsquo is coded language for UFOs.Nick would likely call the documentrsquos revelations a solid five on the Rio count ndash a new global ET ldquoRichter scalersquo developed by academics at our very own St Andrews University. It marks global reports of extraterrestrial activity from zero to  ndash the alarm sounding when Jacob Rees-Mogg rips off his skin suit to reveal true reptilian form.Thatrsquos not all academics at St Andrews have been getting up to though. One of the AATIP reportrsquos  ldquoadvanced technology studies was completed by the impressively alpha-sounding Dr Ulf Leonhardt, a respected German scientist working at the uni at the time.Cynics may think Ulfrsquos ldquoInvisibility Cloaking paper better suited to Hogwartsrsquo library than John McCainrsquos desk, but the good professor is a noted global expert on something called quantum optics, which juxtaposes the fact nothing actually exists with photon manipulation. One day, this may potentially allow a military force to enter a country without being seen.

Yet, as the human brain or internet didnrsquot always exist, an untainted objective reality clearly exists ndash and the empirical truth behind any murky complex mystery involving our species often reveals itself by simply applying one time-tested method ndash following the money. By doing this, the AATIP report is revealed as perhaps less revelatory than hype suggests.From -, the Pentagon spent pound million commissioning these  papers. Meaning, towering piles of hard cash were on offer for academics willing to sell their credibility for a basement swimming pool. Might be dficult to find one who wouldnt. A few imaginative chapters of pseudo-waffle on non-existent technology that only Hollywood CGI can presently bring to le  Beats working for a living.Itrsquos also perhaps no coincidence that many of these ldquoacademics were already already part of a network of true believers ndash the now-defunct ldquoNational Institute for Discovery Science , which was well known for its studies of UFO sightings, extraterrestrials and other ldquofringe topics.To understand why such a band of eccentrics were ever commissioned by the Pentagon in the first place, we must first understand the origins of AATIP. Initiated in  by then US Senator Harry Reid to study unexplained aerial phenomena, the group was formed at the request of Reidrsquos influential friend, Nevada businessman and UFO true believer Robert Bigelow. Who, coincidentally, also founded the aforementioned NIDSci.And, again, entirely coincidentally Irsquom sure, it was Bigelow Aerospace which won the AATIP contract to manage its research.Military writer Joseph Trevithick has since carried out some admirable work uncovering the interesting backgrounds of some of the papers authors, a number of whom already had associations with Bigelow. The largest single source of these Pentagon academic reports is EarthTech International of Texas, whose CEOs both also have close ties to the billionaire business mogul.Trevithick also reveals that Marc Millis, a former NASA propulsion engineer, is also among the authors. Millis apparently left NASA after attending a venture capital event that some fella called Joe Firmage hosted in . Firmage, for those unaware, is a Silicon Valley tech millionaire who claims he had an unexplained visionary experience where a lsquobeingrsquo produced a ball of energy which then entered his body. Weve all been there.Perhaps being exposed to the mind-bending fantasies of some of these academics explains another great mystery of our times ndash why John McCain believed Sarah Palin was a sensible choice of running mate for the  Presidential elections. Likely he thought she would come in handy in a world threatened by extra-terrestrial invasion, being able to communicate directly with destructive, hostile oddities intent on destroying Earth and depleting our natural resources.And finally ...ON his death bed, John McCain enjoyed one last dig at his nemesis Donald Trump, accusing him of ldquohiding behind walls. Although McCain never became president himself, another wall-hating Republican did ndash the aforementioned Ronald Reagan.Although itrsquos unknownthe AATIP paper convinced McCain of a viable alien threat, itrsquos certain that Reagan believed in such a possibility ndash and used his fears as leverage to take down the actual Berlin Wall.During the  Geneva Summit, Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev had a private chat. Years later, Gorbachev revealed that Reagan had simply asked him to set aside their dferences in case the world was invaded by aliens. No, really.Perhaps, in the current climate of ision, intolerance and social discord, another famous fearmongering speech by Ronnie is still relevant today: ldquoI occasionally think how quickly our dferences would vanishwe were facing an alien threat from outside this world.\"Yet, I ask you, is not an alien force already among us  What could be more alien to the universal aspirations of our peoples than war and the threat of war Follow Bill on Twitter: @futureshockbb"},{"url":null,"title":"charity to mark 140th anniversary with celebratory ball","story":"Local charity North East Sensory Services will mark  years of improving lives with a celebratory Ball to remember.The charity operates with the main aim of achieving independence for blind and deaf people.The prestigious Ball event will take place at Aberdeens five-star Marclfe Hotel on Friday, March .A wonderful line-up of entertainment will be topped with a live performance set from singer, radio and television presenter, Aled Jones MBE.Aled has been a household name since the s, and will be forever noted as having been one of the worlds most successful boy sopranos.He is best known for singing Walking in the Air in the animated film, The Snowman.His theatre work is world famous too, having enjoyed starring roles including Joseph in Andrew Lloyd Webbers Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat.The Ball event will be hosted by Emmerdale favourite Chris Chittell, best known for his role as Eric Pollard in the ITV soap.Entertainment will also be provided by top class live band Callanish.Stronachs are kindly sponsoring the champaign reception at the event.A spokesperson for the law firm said: \"Stronachs are delighted to be associated with this long established charity and the services they provide to the blind and deaf communities, and are looking forward to being part of a fantastic launch event.\"Tickets for the Ball are still available for those who would like to join the guest list.

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results.

Its absence soured debates over the rights of EU citizens. It also explains the bitterness over arguments about the Irish backstop. And it is an absence of trust that has shaped relations between London and Edinburgh since June .As Theresa May casts about for support for her Brexit deal, her latest appeal has been to the Scottish, Welsh and indeed Northern Irish parties in Westminster. Speaking in the House of Commons on  January, she declared that while “it will always be for Her Majesty’s Government to negotiate for the whole of the UK, we are also committed to giving the devolved administrations an enhanced role in the next phase, respecting their competence and vital interests in these negotiations”.On the surface, this was a sensible offer. What really matters in terms of the long-term future of the country is not the Withdrawal Agreement currently stuck in parliamentary gridlock, but the future UK-EU relationship. In offering this ‘enhanced’ role to the devolved administrations, the Prime Minister was trying to dilute their opposition to the former with the promise of consultation over the latter. However, as Professor Nicola McEwen noted, Scotland and Wales don’t even get a passing mention in the political declaration, despite it having massive implications for devolved policy areas.Having proffered an olive branch, May then proceeded to snatch it away. After a meeting in Downing Street last week, the First Minister reported that the Prime Minister “was keener to rule out the things she wasn’t prepared to do – extend Article , contemplate a second EU referendum” than to discuss the red lines she had laid down unilaterally back in .Indeed, the UK Government’s only substantive offer was for Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford to attend new Cabinet sub-committee meetings on preparing for the UK’s exit from the EU. “Watch us implement policies we defined despite your objections” is hardly the most enticing proposition.: Brexit: Philip Hammond refuses to rule out quitting in event of no-dealSo far, so predictable. This is typical May. It has been a striking — and, at least since she lost her majority in , dysal — aspect of her style that she is more comfortable ruling options out than opening them up. She has proved happy to make concessions on process as long as it is process heading in a direction she alone has determined.Think back for a second. Immediately after moving into Downing Street, May made her first visit as Prime Minister to Scotland. She stressed her willingness to listen to options and declared her wish to see the Scottish Government “fully engaged in our discussion”. She then proceeded to lay down a series of red lines that directly contradicted the expressed preferences of the Scottish Government to stay in the single market and customs union.The UK Government then published its EUBill, which managed to unite Carwyn Jones and Nicola Sturgeon in describing it as a “naked power grab” by Westminster.The Withdrawal Bill underlined not only the fragility of the devolution settlement, but also the willingness of London to tinker with it as it saw fit. PersonallyI suspect this was more an overwhelmed civil service trying to simply the Brexit process rather than a deliberate attempt to sabotage devolution.: Brexit: Why People’s Vote campaign is failing – Paris GourtsoyannisWhatever the truth, the Withdrawal Bill involved the relocation of powers previously held in Belfast, Cardf and Edinburgh to London as “retained EU law”. The Scottish Parliament refused consent for the EUBill and passed its own Continuity Bill, and the UK Government took the Scottish Government to the Supreme Court. The latter ruled before Christmas that the Bill was legitimate, but that placing requirements on UK ministers was not. Negotiations in court rooms, as opposed to smoke-filled rooms, is rarely a recipe for building trust.Meanwhile, in December MSPs voted by  to  to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Whatever happens in Westminster, evenTheresa May can Houdini herself out of the current bind, this will not be a Brexit deal that has the consent of all parts of the UK.As one might expect, the handling of Brexit by the Government in London has not endeared May to the Scottish public. A large majority are less than impressed by the Prime Minister, with  per cent believing she is doing badly or very badly. By last October, a majorityalso viewed her either unfavourably or very unfavourably. That’s not to say Nicola Sturgeon has had things all her own way either. Brexit and what many view as the shoddy treatment of the devolved settlement has not translated into increased support for independence. As researcher Ian Montagu has explained, this has remained remarkably stable, despite increasing irritation at the Government in Westminster. And the SNP faces a dilemma of their own: according to the Scottish Social Attitudes survey, around half of independence supporters are also Eurosceptic. Between  and , the SNP’s support among this group fell by  percentage points while remaining steady among Europhiles.The creation of this schism in Sturgeon’s electoral coalition is a political problem for the SNP. Yet, May’s uncompromising style, and an inability to build up trust in the last two years, has deepened the schism between Westminster and Edinburgh. The Prime Minister’s inability to build trust through compromise could well be the character flaw that trumps her unionist instincts.Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europeand professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London.

Even when this strategy has demonstrably proved damaging – both Sturgeon and Deputy First Minister John Swinney conceded that the promiseof indyref played its part in the nationalists’ loss of  seats in the  general election – the First Minister has found it impossible to remove this particular record from the turntable.: Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish independence is “bigger than” Alex SalmondWhen times are bad  Then independence is the only way to improve the lot of the Scot. When times are good  Imagine how much better they’d be with independence.Most recently, the chaos of Brexit has been held up by Sturgeon as a compelling reason for the break-up of the UK. The very integrity of our democracy would be threatened by the refusal of the British government to facilitate indyref.Recently, Sturgeon has promised that she will soon set out her thinking on a second independence referendum. Enthusiastic SNP members have taken this to mean it’s game-on for another vote on the constitution.They are kidding themselves.Recent weeks have been, to put things mildly, dficult for the independence movement. Tensions between Sturgeon and her predecessor, Alex Salmond, have bubbled to the surface and created a civil war in the SNP.The instability of this situation should have been enough to force the First Minister to put the brake on the indyref bus. After all, a campaign ided is a campaign that will lose.But evenshe continued, through the recriminations, to harbour the hope that another referendum might be both achievable and winnable, events of the past week – Salmond’s arrest and subsequent court appearance on serious charges – must surely have convinced her to revise her assessment.For some in the SNP – and I speak of people who consider themselves loyal to Sturgeon – the dream of a swt indyref is dead. “We can’t, with everything that is happening, contemplate another referendum,” says one. “We got close to winning in  because we had a tight, well-disciplined campaign. Nobody serious in the SNP could argue that the time is right to kick things off again. People’s minds are where.”From another smart Nat comes the suggestion that Sturgeon should only continue with her plan to lay out her thinking on indyrefshe intends to clearly put it on indefinite hold. The game of “mebbes aye, mebbes naw” must come to an end and the FM should make it clear her priority is on domestic policy rather than constitutional wrangling.I find it impossible to disagree with the assessment of these party insiders that the SNP not in a good place, right now. How could anyone And, this being so, their wish for Sturgeon to press pause on her referendum plans makes perfect sense. It is often forgotten in the heat of constitutional argument that the Scottish Government does not have the power to hold an independence referendum. Sturgeon – as was the case with her predecessor – would require the agreement of the UK government before putting the constitutional question to the people.Recent Sturgeon rhetoric has pointed to her planning a politically expedient battle with Westminster over this point. The FM has spoken repeatedly about her desire to have that authority transferred from London to Edinburgh.In normal circumstances, this battle – one that Sturgeon would lose – might have made sense. The narrative that Westminster dictates rather than listens to the Scottish parliament has served the SNP well in the recent past.But circumstances are not normal and the FM would be open to the charge that such a fight with the UK government was little more than a ersionary tactic. And a tawdry one at that.There has been, among pragmatists in the SNP, some frustration in recent years with the First Minister’s constant pandering to the more excitable among independence supporters. Many feel that, every time she plays to the gallery of the already convinced, she turns off those who –independence is ever to be won – must be persuaded to change their minds. This feeling is sharper than ever right now.I have a great deal of sympathy for those in the SNP who believe Sturgeon should, in recent years, have taken for granted the support of hardcore nationalists. After all, where  are these voters to go  A steady – even cautious – approach to the constitutional argument might not be to their taste but they are unlikely to change their minds on the key question of whether Scotland should be independent. Their votes are already in the bag.Some might feel any declaration by Sturgeon that plans for indyref are on hold would represent a humiliation. I would argue that fighting to stage a vote and then losing it would be a far more damaging course of events.The First Minister has repeatedly said she wishes to be judged on her government’s stewardship of Scotland’s education system. This must become her real priority.The SNP is now deep in crisis and things stand to get very much worse before they get better. If Sturgeon and her party are to survive the months ahead and come out the other end as contenders to win a fourth Holyrood election, she must concentrate on proving to cautious “middle Scotland” voters that the SNP is about more than constitutional wrangling.“It might not be what the independence and nothing less mob wants to hear,” says one activist, “but it is absolutely what has to be donethey’re ever to get what they want.”When Sturgeon succeeded Salmond as First Minister in , she promised to be a leader for all, not just for the pro-independence minority. Circumstances dictate that she must live up to those words. If she doesn’t, the chances of Scots ever voting yes to independence will grow increasingly slender.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863098.1548582733!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit saps support for scottish independence claim unionists","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Brexit is turning Scots against independence, which is seen as an #alien concept# to many young voters in the new, globally connected world, according to the head of the pro-Union campaign. Scotland in Union chief Pamela Nash says it’s “very clear” that Scotland will reject independence as Nicola Sturgeon prepares to set out her plans for a second referendum in the coming weeks. And the prospect of the SNP government seeking to hold its own “Catalonia-style” vote without the authority of Westminster, which has control over the constitution, would be a mistake, she warns.: Euan McColm: A week that put second independence referendum in mothballsBut the claims on voting intentions have been rejected by the SNP, which insists that polling evidence indicates young voters are moving towards Yes.: RT to continue broadcasting Alex Salmond chat showThe pro-Union campaign has stepped up activity in recent months with town hall meetings, high street stalls and a presence at a range of other events. Sturgeon cranked up the pressure on Theresa May on the independence issue at Downing Street last week, suggesting the Prime Minister is afraid of the verdict of the Scottish people.The nationalist government says that Scots deserve an alternative to the Brexit chaos and will increasingly be driven towards supporting independence.But Nash, a former Labour MP, said: “It’s having the opposite impact on people’s views on another independence referendum in Scotland.“People see the chaos that has ensued and they don’t feel that they need more constitutional chaos with another independence referendum in Scotland.“We see very clearly now the dficulties of breaking up decades of political union, but those dficulties would be exponentially biggerwe were breaking up a centuries-old union.“The UK is an important political union, but it’s not just that, it’s the economy and, most importantly, it’s our shared culture and history. “I can understand why that question is being asked, but it’s just not what we’re seeing and it’s also not what’s playing out in the polls either.“Polling has not moved in every single poll that was taken over the past year.“People see those dferences and they actually want stability. They don’t want to go through even more turmoil.”According to Nash, the recent feedback from meetings around the country and events like Glasgow and Edinburgh Pride is that Brexit has altered the views of many about Scotland being in the UK.She said: “They don’t want to cut off those opportunities and they want to keep that as open as possible. That has had a big impact which the SNP has not reflected.“The world has continued to become increasingly interconnected. We were making these arguments in , but that has developed much, much faster than we would have anticipated,” said Nash. “That is the argument we will be putting to the younger generation as well – that it’s an alien concept to put up more barriers and borders when the world is much \u2028more interconnected when we want to travel and we want to work with people throughout the world when we’re sitting in our own living rooms. “I’ve spoken to young people who since Brexit have changed their minds on the support they had for Scotland being independent before – it made them think again.”But the SNP insists the most recent polling from Panelbase indicates  per cent of Scots aged  to  would vote Yes in an independence referendum. This has steadily increased over the past year as the Brexit chaos has intensied, according to surveys from a iety of pollsters.Nationalist MSP George Adam dismissed Nash’s claims as “demonstrably untrue”.“This simply exposes how rattled the SiU are by the consistent polling which shows that – by a factor of two to one – young Scots overwhelmingly back independence,” he said.Scotland in Union formed in early  as the dust settled on the previous year’s independence referendum. Its aim was to make the pro-Union case as support for the SNP soared. But despite the political upheaval of the past four years, the one constant has been the level of support for independence, which has remained broadly around the same  per cent level it stood at when the referendum was held.“There’s a need for Scotland to continually make the positive case for remaining in the United Kingdom, which could easily be lost at the moment with everything that’s going on,” said Nash. The fact is that it’s still the best way forward for Scotland’s future to have increased stability and opportunities and the global influence of being part of the UK.“We do need a continued campaign to make that case. The polls haven’t changed much, but we would want to increase support further.”For those who might be tempted to vote for Scotland to leave the UK as a means of rejoining the European Union, Nash said there was no easy route to becoming a member. “The evidence points towards a y application process with no guarantees at the end,” she said.Recent weeks have seen senior SNP figures such as former deputy leader Jim Sillars and MP Pete Wishart urge a more cautious approach to a second referendum until the case has been made and victory looks assured.But Sturgeon is also facing growing calls from grassroots activists and the Greens at Holyrood to forge ahead and call a second vote.The First Minister has been accused of “playing to the gallery” in recent statements on the issue.“For any party leader there’s an element of having to keep their own supporters onside – there’s no doubt that’s what Nicola is doing,” said Nash.Similarly Sturgeon’s pledge to announce her timetable has been put back a number of times as the Brexit chaos ensued.“We were first expecting that last June and that’s continued. It keeps getting put off every few weeks,” said Nash.The Scottish Government has always been clear in public that the  referendum – held after a Section  order was agreed with Westminster – was the “gold standard” for holding such votes. But recent weeks have seen suggestions from leading SNP figures to look at the option of a “Catalan-style” referendum, which would see a vote staged “illegally” by the Scottish Government without a Section  order from Westminster. Reports have even indicated that the Scottish Government is seeking legal advice on such a move.“I think that would be a very silly move from the Scottish Government to go ahead and do that,” said Nash.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863168.1548590166!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon scottish independence is bigger than alex salmond","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Criminal charges against Alex Salmond do not damage the case for independence, Nicola Sturgeon has said.The First Minister insisted that the campaign for an independent Scotland was “bigger than any one man”.Her predecessor as First Minister and SNP leader was told this week he faces  charges including attempted rape, indecent assault and breach of the peace.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players from throughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams from Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face. to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

We regard this as the most important constitutional gathering in a generation,” he said.The conference comes as uncertainty continues to remain over the issue of the Irish border backstop along with the need to ensure EU rights are protected after Brexit.Last November one thousand prominent nationalistsportspeople, artists, actors and leading business heads put their signatories to an open letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining their concerns. At the time the Taoiseach responded by insisting the interests of Irish citizens north of the border are a “priority” in the Brexit negotiations."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.30.08.png","title":"eye on the past january","story":"Twinbrook anger at RUCTHERE has been angry reaction from Twinbrook residents to a raid by RUC men on a house in the area which led to the arrest of a father of seven for the non payment of a £ fine.During the raid three RUC men – two of them carrying sub-machince guns – burst into the home of Mr Gerard Duffy at Glasvey Gardens and he was punched and kicked before being taken to the RUC barracks at Dunmurry.Mr Duffy was lted for non-payment of a fine imposed because his car had not been taxed. But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”. IN a front page article in the Sunday World this week reporter John Keane disclosed that the , political prisoners in the Long Kesh internment camp are being held in huts which would be regarded by the EEC farming officials as unsuitable for pighouses.AdvertisementsHUNTING LODGEScotch from £.Vodka from £.Gin from £.Double litre Italian wine £.Full range of winesCans Skol p  doz Packs Lager pBrandy from £.Hennessy Brandy at £.Plus an extensive range of LiquersLámh Dearg GAC Social Club Behind Watters old pub at the top of Hannahstown Hill.A great night of singing and dancing on Sunday.ROMANOSSaturday  January - – From the top of the charts KENNYSaturday  February GLITTER BAND."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"our playground was upton cottages and arizona street","story":"IN March , an ‘Arizona Street and Upton Cottages reunion party’ was held in the Glenowen. It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"dup under pressure from within to get brexit deal to end border poll calls report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new strain was found to inhibit multi-resistant bacteria identied by the World Health Organisationas a major threat to human health.According to local belief, the miracle soil from the Sacred Heart Church near Enniskillen can cure infections after it was found to contains a new strain of streptomyces, a micro-organism used to produce antibiotics. Dr Gerry Quinn said his research was inspired by his great-uncle, who believed he could cure jaundice by foraging natural ingredients in the mountains.However, the discovery has caused some controversy. The Impartial Reporter newspaper said a signicant increase in visitors to the church grounds to collect some of the soil is causing concern among locals, who are worried that things may be \"getting a bit out of hand\". Last week the parish priest Fr Cathal Deery refused permission for television crews from the BBC and UTV to film in the churchyard.However, his decision was overruled by Monsignor Joseph McGuinness, administrator of the Diocese of Clogher. He said he did not know permission had been declined, blaming a communication breakdown.Fr Deery declined to comment on the matter when contacted yesterday. However, in a statement, Monsignor McGuinness apologised to the priest and his parishioners, saying he wasnt aware that Fr Deery had initially refused the television crews access to the church grounds. He said: \"When I was approached by the BBC for permission to film at Boho, I was unaware that they had previously been in contact with Fr Deery.

BlairNo deal could be disaster for horse racing and breeding, warns trainer HamiltonMr Varadkar was speaking after Chancellor Philip Hammond had pulled out of a  discussion on Europe he was participating in, alongside a number of other European leaders in Davos.The Taoiseach said that a no-deal Brexit would result in a period of \"chaos\" and that Ireland would have to negotiate with the EU and UK to avoid a hard border.The UK is currently on course for a no-deal Brexit, with no agreement in place ahead of the UK leaving the EU on March .Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit withdrawal plan was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs earlier this month.Mrs May presented her Brexit \"Plan B\" to the Commons on Monday, with MPs set to vote again on January .Mr Varadkar said Ireland would face a \"major dilemma\"there is a no-deal scenario.\"Ireland has obligations to protect the single market, the United Kingdom would have a responsibility to abide by World Trade Organisation rules, and both the United Kingdom and Ireland would have responsibilities to honour the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process,\" he said.\"So I think wed end up in a situation whereby the EU and Ireland and the UK would have to come together and in order to honour our commitment to the people of Ireland that there would be no hard border, we would have to agree on full alignment on customs and regulations.\"The Taoiseach said that he thought Mrs Mays Brexit deal was the best option on the table.\"After a period of chaos we would perhaps end up exactly where we are now, with a very similar deal,\" Mr Varadkar said.\"The truth is nobody can know for sure what would happen in a no-deal scenario, thats why we worked so hard over the past two years to put together a withdrawal agreement.\"Responding to the comments, DUP MP Nigel Dodds said that his party was committed to seeing a Brexit deal that worked for people in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.However, he said that he rejected Mr Varadkars \"analysis\" and called on him to work \"constructively\" to reach a consensus.\"It is not a constructive contribution when we are focused on trying to reach a consensus,\" the North Belfast MP said.\"In any case, the Taoiseach’s comments about the Belfast Agreement actually ride a coach and horses through that Agreement. \"Mr Varadkar is evidently and understandably concerned about the impact of a ‘no deal’ on the Republic of Ireland but this is a time to tone down the rhetoric and keep cool heads.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dunlop family supportive of michaels

It was the third road tragedy to hit the Dunlop family. Williams legendary uncle Joey Dunlop OBE died in  while racing in Tallinn, Estonia and just eight years later tragedy struck again when his own father Robert was killed during a practice session at the North West .At the time of his death, William had been looking forward to the birth of his second child with his partner Janine Brolly.Williams \"pride and joy\" - his daughter Ella - marked her second birthday just three days after her father was buried. The couples baby girl, Willa Wren, was born two months after his death.Speaking to the Belfastlast night, Michaels mother Louise Dunlop said that he \"does what he wants to do\". She said that she had to get behind Michael as he gets back on the road, ing to the Isle of Man TT Races with Tyco BMW.\"To be honest, I dont know how I feel,\" she said. \"I only heard the other day. He does what he wants to do. I have to be honest about that. Quite frankly,he wants to do that, we have to get behind him.\"Last week William was posthumously inducted into the Irish Motorcycling Hall of Fame at the annual Cornmarket Motorcycle Awards in Belfast.Accepting the award, his partner Janine spoke about Williams legacy and revealed she was starting the William Dunlop Foundation for other children who had lost a parent.She said: \"As Ella and Willas mum, my job is to fix things and unfortunately I cant fix this for them, theyve lost their daddy.\"And as tremendous as William was and the legacy that hes left is, they are missing out on a le with him.\"And unfortunately there is a lot of children who also are unfortunately in that position and maybe dont have the motorcycle community to support them.\"Hence, the foundation idea was born. Its main basis will be the support of children who have suffered the bereavement of a parent and hand-in-hand with that will be the support of the partner left behind.\".

We need rights codied and enshrined in law,” he said.“We do not need warm words about the Common Travel Area. We need it written down and formalised.”Massive cheer in the room as Paul Gosling comments that \"If only the British government could organise Brexit as well as the organisers here today\". #IrelandsFuture. pic vDoIBVCXE— Irelands FutureJanuary , The professor was speaking at the Beyond Brexit event in Belfast which examined what Northern Ireland would look like post-Brexit.He said: “We acknowledge the special arrangements in the Withdrawal Agreement and the majority of people here want to see theprotocol as a medicating factor for the terrible situation we are in.“We are beyond the stage of warm words. There are things the British Government can do – get on and do it.“We are being told that we cannot talk about the Good Friday Agreement mechanism for permanently getting rid of the hard border on this island.“We will not be seeking permission from anyone to talk about the unity of our country.”Professor Harvey also defended the event’s organisers for not inviting Unionists to speak at the conference at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall.“Let me absolutely clear, we apologise to no-one for being here today and having the conversation about the rights of Irish citizens,” he said.“I make no apology for being with you today.”The Beyond Brexit gathering in Belfast is the latest initiative by Ireland’s Future – a collective of Irish citizens living in the region seeking to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on their rights and livelihoods.The prospect of united Ireland is reasonable.Paul GoslingFacebookTwitterPolitical commentator Brian Feeney told the audience that Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland have been “left behind” by the Irish Government.Mr Feeney, who was one of a number of lists speaking at the event, also accused the British Government of being in contravention of the Good Friday Agreement.He explained: “Their default position is:you are living in the North, you are a British citizen and there is nothing you can do about it.“They say an international treaty has no constitutional position in Her Majesty Government’s law.“We hear all these promises , we are told: ‘You won’t be left behind, we are totally committed to this’ – warm words. That’s all we get.”Journalist Paul Gosling said that he has been left “appalled” by people in England who he claimed “do not care about the border”.“The rise of English nationalism is what drove Brexit. It represents a challenge and a threat to democracy,” he added.He also said he could not support a border poll at the present time.“We have to think and plan.

It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland.

We think that request should be made now, but nevertheless I think Yvette Cooper’s amendment takes us in the right direction.”On Saturday the Scottish Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell spoke at a Rally for Europe in support of a People’s Vote.He said it would be “physically possible” to organise another referendum in the time available before the Brexit due date, however it remains one of the lesser considered options in Westminster.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  When Ms Sturgeon was asked about its chances, she told Mr Marr: “I don’t think it’s off the table. I do accept that as things stand right now there doesn’t appear to be a majority in the House of Commons and that’s because for reasons that only he can or can’t explain, Jeremy Corbyn is fixedly on the fence on this issue. He said he wanted to try to get a general election, he tried that and failed. “It seems to me it’s incumbent on Labour to make its position on this clear –it does so then I do think there would possibly be a majority in the House of Commons so Labour, at the moment, are the block to that and I think that’s deeply regrettable. “We’ll have to wait and see what Labour’s position would be.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

We need rights codied and enshrined in law,” he said.“We do not need warm words about the Common Travel Area. We need it written down and formalised.”The professor was speaking at the Beyond Brexit event in Belfast which examined what Northern Ireland would look like post-Brexit.He said: “We acknowledge the special arrangements in the Withdrawal Agreement and the majority of people here want to see theprotocol as a medicating factor for the terrible situation we are in.“We are beyond the stage of warm words. There are things the British Government can do - get on and do it.“We are being told that we cannot talk about the Good Friday Agreement mechanism for permanently getting rid of the hard border on this island.“We will not be seeking permission from anyone to talk about the unity of our country.”Professor Harvey also defended the event’s organisers for not inviting unionists to speak at the conference at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall.“Let me absolutely clear, we apologise to no-one for being here today and having the conversation about the rights of Irish citizens,” he said.“I make no apology for being with you today.”The Beyond Brexit gathering in Belfast is the latest initiative by Ireland’s Future - a collective of Irish citizens living in the region seeking to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on their rights and livelihoods.Orange family stunned by death of husband and we Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Political commentator Brian Feeney told the audience that Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland have been “left behind” by the Irish Government.Mr Feeney, who was one of a number of lists speaking at the event, also accused the British Government of being in contravention of the Good Friday Agreement.He explained: “Their default position is:you are living in the North, you are a British citizen and there is nothing you can do about it.“They say an international treaty has no constitutional position in Her Majesty Government’s law.“We hear all these promises , we are told: ‘You won’t be left behind, we are totally committed to this’ - warm words. That’s all we get.”Journalist Paul Gosling said that he has been left “appalled” by people in England who he claimed “do not care about the border”.“The rise of English nationalism is what drove Brexit. It represents a challenge and a threat to democracy,” he added.He also said he could not support a border poll at the present time.“We have to think and plan. We could have a defeat in the South which could put us back many years,” he continued.“The prospect of united Ireland is reasonable.”try catch  TrendingSnow brings N.I. to standstill - traffic chaos as Belfast International Airport shuts runwayIN PHOTOS:  pictures of the heavy snowfall in Northern IrelandDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NIMissing N.I. boyfound safe and well found safe and well\"          ..

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/prog_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business darina armstrong","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Darina Armstrong’s career within the Progressive Building Society began at a young age, working her way up to leading the organisation since  – almost  years after first starting with the society.“I absolutely love everything about the business. I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer.
