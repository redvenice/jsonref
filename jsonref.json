She sought a French court order to force the child to return to France. But his aunt, Moira, based near Hexham in Northumberland, said she would be \u0027terrified for him if he goes back\u0027. She said the youngster had told a counsellor that while in France there were times when \u0027he went to sleep at night and wished he wouldn\u0027t wake up in the morning\u0027.She said 40-year-old Charlie, who works in shipping, would have been willing to go to one of UAE\u0027s prisons for his child - but realised he would not have been any help behind bars.Eventually, Charlie agreed to hand Jamie over to his estranged wife at a family centre court in the UAE in an attempt to \u0027keep on the right side of the law\u0027.But the family said Jamie screamed as he was taken away, refused to go with his mother and was then taken into the orphanage.Mrs Oomes said: \u0027What is a father supposed to do faced with trying to keep on the right side of the law by trying to return his son to France, whilst also trying to respect Jamie\u0027s wishes to stay with him in Dubai, and of course protecting his son\u0027s right to live in a protective, loving and stable environment.\u0027This is not a custody battle situation. Jamie refused to return to France before any custody was sought through French courts following the parents\u0027 separation. \u0027This is about a nine-year-old child being locked away because his wish is to stay living in Dubai with his father. This is about the human rights of a British child being completely ignored. This is about saving the life of a child who is not able to cope with his current predicament.

As many as 90 Tory MPs are threatening to defy her in the ‘meaningful vote’.Today the Treasury will publish a major economic analysis that is expected to show that a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster compared with the PM’s blueprint.The 150-page paper will set out the impact of scenarios, including Mrs May’s Chequers deal, the so-called Norway option, the ‘Canada Plus’ model and a no-deal exit.The analysis is expected to warn that no deal would have a dire impact. The Bank of England is also expected to publish an analysis showing it would hit house prices.          Asked to choose between Mrs May’s plan and leaving the EU with no deal, voters opt for no deal by 41 per cent to 35          In other Brexit developments yesterday:Boris Johnson tried to muscle in on a planned TV debate between Mrs May and Jeremy CorbynNo 10 said the PM would snub Donald Trump at this week’s G20 meeting after he said her proposals could wreck hopes of a trade dealIt emerged that Mr Trump’s intervention came hours after her plans were attacked by Nigel Farage on the President’s favourite TV showAllies of Mrs May warned Brexiteers that Britain could be forced into a permanent customs union if parliament rejects her dealCar industry bosses warned that failure to agree a deal would be ‘catastrophic’MPs warned of chaos at ports under no dealDowning Street confirmed it would publish only a summary of attorney general Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice on the backstopFormer defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon described Mrs May’s deal as ‘doomed’An attempt to woo Labour MPs appeared to have flopped after just 26 turned up to a briefing by Mrs May’s aides and none said they would back her plan.          Asked to choose between Mrs May’s plan and the prospect of a Labour government, voters favoured the Prime Minister by 46 per cent to 31 per cent          Today’s poll asked voters whether they agreed that Mrs May’s Brexit deal was ‘not ideal but the best on offer’ – 52 per cent agreed against just 19 per cent who did not          Today’s poll asked voters whether they agreed that Mrs May’s Brexit deal was ‘not ideal but the best on offer’ – 52 per cent agreed against just 19 per cent who did not.Forty-four per cent said the EU would not make further concessions to the UK if Mrs May lost. Nor do voters think a new Tory leader such as Boris Johnson would do any better, with only 25 per cent saying ousting Mrs May would increase the prospects of a better deal.Almost half of those polled said the Prime Minister would have no choice but to resign if she lost the Commons vote.Tory supporters are more sympathetic: well over half said she should stay in office in defeat. Tellingly, when the Brexit vote is framed in the way that Mrs May has put it – that Brexit is ‘the best deal for UK and MPs should back it because it is time to get on with Brexit’ – she gets a clear thumbs-up. A total of 49 per cent agree, with 22 per cent against. The results will be seized on by Downing St as evidence that while MPs are against Mrs May, voters are with her and are impressed by her dogged determination.The poll suggests however that this does not translate into enthusiasm for her deal.          Boris Johnson tried to muscle in on a planned TV debate between Mrs May and Jeremy CorbynAsked to choose between Mrs May’s plan and leaving the EU with no deal, voters opt for no deal by 41 per cent to 35. When asked to choose between the Prime Minister’s plan and staying in the EU, voters opt to remain by 46 to 37. And faced with leaving with no deal and staying in the EU, voters opt to remain by 50 to 40.Further support for staying in the EU is reflected in growing backing for the campaign for the ‘People’s Vote’ – in effect a second referendum.A total of 48 per cent support the idea with 34 opposed. But the public is in no doubt about the potential humiliation caused by any decision to reverse Brexit at the 11th hour – 47 per cent say it would damage our international standing against 24 per cent who disagree.Damian Lyons-Lowe, boss of Survation, the only polling company to get the result of the 2017 general election right, said: ‘The results show the deal doesn’t please anyone, but the public knows it is the end of the negotiations and think that they – and MPs – should be realistic.‘They regard Mrs May’s deal as the least worst option and better than a Labour government.’A total of 1,030 adults took part in the online poll yesterday afternoon.Brussels has launched a campaign to lure finance and insurance firms away from London. The Belgian government is hoping to poach them by pointing out that companies would have a ‘passport’ to the EU’s single market.It is hoping another draw will be the close proximity to key EU institutions such as the Commission.Cécile Jodogne, the country’s secretary of state for foreign trade for the federal region of Brussels, said: ‘Brussels is where key European decisions are taken.’    Changing tack now will only make things worse Analysis by SIMON WALTERSSome Tory MPs have said Mrs May’s deal is ‘as dead as a dodo’. But the Survation poll suggests that while the public regard it as an ugly duckling, they do not want MPs to kill it off in the Commons vote.The survey provides the clearest evidence yet of the mass confusion caused by Britain’s Brexit crisis.Bearing in mind it says MPs should back Mrs May’s deal, you would think her option would fare well when compared in a straight contest with the two other main options: ‘no deal’ favoured by Jacob Rees-Mogg, and remaining in the EU, favoured by Tony Blair.Not so. In a political version of rock, paper, scissors, when asked to choose between Mrs May’s deal and ‘no deal’, voters choose the latter. Asked to pick between her deal and Remain they opt for Remain. When asked to choose between ‘no deal’ and Remain, Remain wins.By that reckoning, Blair wins, with Rees-Mogg second and May last.          May at Queen\u0027s University in Belfast, during her visit to Northern Ireland, where she has been speaking about her Brexit dealBut that is all hypothetical.When the only question that matters for now is put – should MPs back Mrs May on December 11? – the answer is yes. How can these conflicting findings be reconciled?The public thinks Brexit has become a mess but it is too late to do much about it – and that to change tack now would risk causing an even bigger mess.  "},{"url":null,"title":"University chiefs admit tutors pressure inflate grades","story":"    Staff may be tempted to hand out more top marks because they fear bad reviews in student feedback surveys, they said (stock image)The confessions come in a report which claims that better teaching and more dedicated students have led to more top degree results – but a proportion of the change over the last decade remains ‘unexplained’.The study was commissioned by Universities UK, which represents vice chancellors, amid fears that degrees are being devalued.

The report notes for the first time that the pressure from students who want ‘good degrees’ has created ‘incentives to increase upper degrees’.It says: ‘There is likely to have been a system-wide inflationary dynamic that has contributed to the increase in upper classifications over time.’Professor Andrew Wathey, vice chancellor of the University of Northumbria, said: ‘This report shows that there is a clear need for the higher education sector to take action to grip the issue of grade inflation.’           Professor Andrew Wathey, vice chancellor of the University of Northumbria, said: ‘This report shows that there is a clear need for the higher education sector to take action to grip the issue of grade inflation.’ Pictured: City Campus East of Northumbria UniversityThe report was produced by UUK, GuildHE and the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.It found some of the increase in firsts and 2.1s could be explained by factors such as ‘additional investment’ and ‘heightened student motivation’.However, a portion of the increase remains ‘unexplained’ and ‘could be due to unaccounted factors and, potentially, inflated grades’.The study says many employers screen out any candidates not achieving a 2.1 or first, meaning students are desperate to get these grades. In addition, tutors may be tempted to give out more high grades because they fear getting bad reviews from students in official feedback surveys.And because the proportion of 2.1s and firsts awarded at universities now features in consumer league tables, institutions are under pressure to hand out more too.The report even notes that some universities create targets for staff to increase the number of top grades they hand out.UUK said it was now planning changes to the degree classification system to tackle ‘perceptions of grade inflation’.Universities are independent of the Government and are free to set their own grading systems but are answerable to the Office for Students regulator."},{"url":null,"title":"SIR ANTHONY SELDON Derided arts students valuable ever","story":"    Historian Sir Antony Seldon (above) says seeing the study of the arts as a disadvantage later in life is ruinously short-sightedCan it really be true that it is a disadvantage in life to study and learn the works of great writers such as John Milton and Charles Dickens?If you spend your time immersed in Shakespeare at university or in the great artists of the Renaissance, will it set you back?Certainly, at first glance, that\u0027s what new research suggests. A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that male creative arts graduates are likely to earn 14 per cent less than their peers who didn\u0027t go to university.To some, it will be seen as damning proof that an education in the arts is an expensive self-indulgence, a complete waste of time for any students who choose to pursue it. As a historian and as the vice chancellor of Buckingham University, I cannot help but despair at such a view.Seeing the arts in this way is not only woefully narrow- minded, it is ruinously short-sighted, ignoring the changing needs of Britain in the 21st century, a time when the vital skills students learn during an arts education will be more important than ever.The emotional tangles found in Jane Austen novels, for example, are a blueprint for diplomacy, sensitivity and realpolitik within a family (or business) as well as great tales of romance.A knowledge of great literature can offer an unequalled foundation for adult life, for it tells us so much about the human character and iniduals\u0027 foibles and failings.          A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that male creative arts graduates are likely to earn 14 per cent less than their peers who didn\u0027t go to university. Stock photoThe point is that time at university is about far more than merely maximising a student\u0027s future earnings. It is about the development of more rounded, innovative, empathetic iniduals.Beyond the preparation for a career, a successful university course should help students to have lives of fullness and meaning, no matter what they subsequently earn. Assisted by the best sort of teaching, they can learn how better to communicate, to relate to other people, to be more creative, and to manage their own mental health — all critical skills in the new Britain now emerging.\u0027I have a masters and now I work for Deliveroo\u0027: Literature...Having a degree increases average earning by 26 per cent for...Share this articleA utilitarian focus simply on earning capacity would create a stultifyingly dull society.We would become dominated by engineers, scientists, doctors and economists, because those are the disciplines that attract highest incomes.That would be sad for the students who are forced to limit their horizons, and sad for Britain, because so much of the vibrancy and humanity that enriches our lives and culture would be lost.Universities were founded as arenas to guide young people into making the widest possible contribution to society. Because they cover such a range of the human experience, the arts are uniquely equipped for the task.They can make their students better at communication, self-awareness and entrepreneurship — qualities that will be even more important as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technology grow in influence.          A knowledge of great literature can offer an unequalled foundation for adult life. Pictured, Charles Dickens For in a world where algorithms prevail, there will be an even greater need for social interaction and creativity.Then there is the nature of post-Brexit Britain. We will almost certainly be leaving the EU in March, and if we are to make a success of it, we will have to exploit our nation\u0027s strengths. That has to mean making the most of Britain\u0027s global leadership in the arts.Where once our nation was the workshop of the world, we are now its creative hub, aided by our rich heritage and the dominance of English — the main language of the planet.Our small islands have produced many of the greatest writers in history, as well as magnificent artists like Turner, pioneering architects such as Christopher Wren and more recently Richard Rogers, popular musicians like The Beatles and Adele, and universally admired actors like Anthony Hopkins and Judi Dench.The British arts must be treasured, not derided, as we begin a new chapter in our national life.All that said, arts teaching in higher education is not always as good as it could be. The fact is that the problems graduates can face in the workplace are too often compounded by the poor quality of the courses they studied.In some areas of life there is a profound disconnect between the real world of the commercial arts — particularly the media, the theatre, publishing and the cinema — and the modules taught on academic courses, which can be full of esoteric jargon and heavily politicised theorising.It is telling that many major media organisations would sooner recruit a science graduate than one with a degree in media studies from some institutions, partly because such courses are perceived not to provide rigorous grounding. These issues have grown worse in recent years as a host of other problems have undermined arts courses.           To some, it will be seen as damning proof that an education in the arts is an expensive self-indulgence. Stock photoOne is the low level of contact hours and tutorials on offer, which means that students are not receiving the personal guidance they need — and have paid for. Another is the huge increase in class size and lectures, again leaving students isolated and lacking academic oversight and support.It is no wonder that, in this age of educational mass production, so many students complain about poor value for money. Given the levels of debt that they now incur, with tuition fees costing an annual £9,250, it would be irresponsible to ignore their concerns.But there is a straightforward solution. Due to rising tuition fees, the balance of power is gradually shifting from the institutions to the students who pay the bills. They are no longer willing to put up with shoddy teaching, poor employability, irrelevant modules or purposeless studies.That is a challenge for universities. But crucially it is also a great opportunity for the arts. Rather than serving as a threat, the establishment of this vibrant new culture ought to allow arts courses to reveal their true worth beyond simply this obsession with the money added to graduates\u0027 salaries.When properly delivered, such courses are invaluable because they can build better citizens, by improving empathy, resilience, understanding and personal responsibility. This is not some vision concocted by an out-of-touch don in an ivory tower, it is a reflection of what we can already see happening in workplaces up and down the country.The arts underpin entrepreneurship by encouraging original thought and innovative solutions. This will be more important as major corporations are replaced by start-ups and free-wheeling enterprises.That is exactly what we at Buckingham University have recognised. To reflect that, today our Entrepreneurship Centre is to be opened by Frank Field MP, the perfect guest on account of his reputation as one of the most independent-minded Members of Parliament.I believe passionately that the statistics about the future prospects of arts students should not be the death knell of arts teaching, but a clarion call for its growth.What\u0027s more, I believe, as we move towards the middle of the 21st century, every student in medicine, engineering or science should have some modules in the arts, just as every arts student must be armed with a level of numeracy and science.How appalling it would be if teaching was simply a matter of the size of their pupils\u0027 future salaries.n Sir Anthony Seldon is the author of The Fourth Education Revolution. "},{"url":null,"title":"Cheers Gin sales rocket 254 cent ten years","story":"    Gin has moved from suburban cocktail parties to the height of fashion with a 276 per cent increase in sales in less than ten years, according to official figures.A report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) shows the value leapt from £130million to £461million since 2009, and Britain produces some three-quarters of all the gin made in Europe.On its own, gin is an unremarkable, albeit powerful, spirit, distilled from barley, maize or wheat.However, the secret of its success and new found popularity comes from the many exotic flavourings that are added.Traditionally, the overwhelming flavour of gin came from the juniper berry, but now there is a huge range of options, including many herbs and fruits.The creation of these flavours is presented as something of an art form, designed to appeal to connoisseurs and hipsters alike.Such is the popularity of gin that earlier this year it was added to the official basket of goods used by the Office of National Statistics to calculate inflation.NHS worker, 38, who led police on road chase after crashing...Advent of the VERY Merry Christmas: Calendars once packed...Share this articleGin has undergone a remarkable journey from the scourge of the working classes to a style statement.In the 1700s it was sold as a medicine and, bizarrely, was promoted as a cure for gout and indigestion, but most attractive of all, it was cheap.In the 1730’s notices could be seen all over London. The message was short and to the point ‘Drunk for 1 penny, Dead drunk for tuppence.’ In London alone, there were more than 7,000 ‘dram shops’, and 10 million gallons of gin were being distilled annually.Gin was hawked by barbers, pedlars, and grocers and even sold on market-stalls.

It is more than twice the height of the London Eye, the next-tallest moving visitor attraction in the capital.The planning application was lodged on 13 November and has already attracted some opposition from local residents.Manuel Kaiser told City of London planners during a public consultation that “the proposal reeks of desperation in its straining after ostentatious effect”.Anastasia Shteyn seconded Kaiser and said: “I don’t understand why we need this phallic-shaped attraction, with little aesthetic merit. As a resident of Petticoat Tower, I object to this construction project. It will create noise and turn the neighbourhood into a construction site for years to come, affecting property prices and residents’ daily comfort.”Astrid Kirchner said it “would fit better into Dubai than London”, and Marianne Harris asked: “Is there a competition for the ugliest skyscraper?”’s architecture critic, Oliver Wainwright, said: “The architects may have been aiming for a tulip, but the structure is more reminiscent of a coconut shy, or an egg perched at the top of an etiolated egg cup. The structural spoons, meanwhile, have the inescapable look of obstetrical forceps, brandishing the freshly extracted Gherkin baby towards the clouds.”Foster and Partners has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9515993a5aebb757c7a00dea3ff451b9fb1d5eff/298_432_3702_2222/master/3702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4185b48f5f6230db0c1b66da6f630863","title":"the trolley boys of manila in pictures","story":" Scores of commuters in the Philippine capital, whose metropolitan area is home to about 13 million, are propelled to their destinations daily by so-called ‘trolley boys’, who push metal carts along a few segments of the sprawling capital’s railroads"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a83a6a3b12a8385ff1f7aeedabfcc9395ba33508/2727_459_4798_2880/master/4798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b90634a3ec95543f3097a3e1b9be410","title":"paradise lost miles aldridge and todd hidos suburban nightmares huxley parlour gallery london","story":"With their desperate housewives and sinister driveways, an exhibition at London’s Huxley-Parlour Gallery pairs two artists whose work investigates and subverts the concept of suburbia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6392b22ef8026d90b55dd0456f30803883569fc/0_356_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66e584434cb42afb84a55bb7f4c5b097","title":"have you ever read a pirated book or been affected by piracy share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have downloaded books illegally and those affected by book piracyThe rise in book piracy coincides with author salaries dropping around the world, with the average UK author earning less than minimum wage.

The report also proposes that all companies in Britain with more than 250 staff would have to reveal the names of employees paid more than £150,000 a year.Coming in the wake of a study by the International Labour Organisation earlier this week showing that wage growth in Britain had been the weakest of nine advanced countries over the past decade, the report says its 20 recommendations are necessary to “curb undeserved executive pay and also create mechanisms for better distribution of income”.Labour, which is seeking to show it is ready to fight a snap election if Theresa May’s government collapses over Brexit, gave a warm welcome to the report commissioned from a team led by Prem Sikka, professor of accountancy and finance at Sheffield University.Party sources stressed it would be wrong to assume all the suggestions would make it into the party’s next manifesto but Long-Bailey and McDonnell are well disposed towards five key reforms proposed by Sikka:Stakeholders includes shareholders, long-term customers and employees.Labour believes an attempt to curb boardroom pay is justified by the lack of restraint shown by company boards and the failure of voluntary codes to have any impact on executive remuneration. Sikka’s proposed reforms would apply to the 7,000-plus companies in the UK that have 250 or more employees, accounting for more than 10 million workers.Long-Bailey said: “Whilst many of our businesses work hard to ensure that rewards and prosperity are fairly shared across their workforce, there continues to exist a pernicious corporate culture in some firms that many across Britain would view as immoral.“It cannot be right that in just three working days, the UK’s top bosses will have made more money than the typical full-time worker will earn in the entire year. Labour will look closely at the recommendations of this report as we seek to build on our existing policy of tackling pay inequality.”Labour believes it can tap into rising public anger fanned by the weakest decade for employee pay since the 19th century. The report notes that a typical chief executive of a FTSE 100 company earned around 20 times the wages of the average British worker in the 1980s, but this had risen to 70 times by the early 2000s and to 150 times by the mid 2010s.The report suggests employees and other stakeholders should have a say in setting boardroom pay in order to “exert pressure for better distribution of income and improved quality of service for consumers”.The report added it would be simple to identify the customers of utility companies but that loyalty schemes made it possible to take account of customers’ views of other big firms as well.“Thus, consumers in many industries can be identified with certainty and must be empowered to vote on executive pay. This would help to check profiteering, mis-selling of products, poor services and abuses of customers.”Employees facing wage freezes and stakeholders experiencing poor products, poor service and high prices were unlikely to back big rises for executives and this would act as a powerful check on “exorbitant” pay for directors, the report noted.“If company directors think that they deserve more then they must seek approval from all stakeholders, which is unlikely to be granted unless there is a corresponding improvement in benefits for them all.McDonnell said: “Coming on the heels of the International Labour Organisation’s report on Monday, the scale of bonuses and the opaque way they are paid should be a source of shame to those running our economy. The government have shown no interest in tackling the causes of inequality in our society and we are grateful to Prof Sikka and his team for shining a light on the problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b3973071599c098609d03dd48275e15d233969c/0_0_1542_925/master/1542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d500746c5156cda55fa0701730a0ae","title":"the rise of the meanwhile space how empty properties are finding second lives","story":"Rather than let properties lie empty, Paris is learning to hand them over temporarily to community groups and startupsHospitals are rarely places of cheer and creativity, but the former Saint-Vincent-de-Paul hospital in Paris’s 14th district is one of the most exciting places on the left bank. Former ambulance bays and car parks now house allotments, a boules court, a makeshift football pitch and an urban campsite, and up to 1,000 visitors a day come to browse its market, eat at its cafes or catch a free live performance.Renamed Les Grands Voisins, or The Great Neighbours, the site is a magnet for Parisians and tourists alike, its former treatment rooms, A\u0026ampE building and wards now a hub of social and commercial enterprise. Alongside a hostel providing 600 beds for the homeless are artisan studios, pop-up shops and startups. “It’s like a village, an inclusive space with social areas and job opportunities where different people can interact,” says William Dufourcq, director of Aurore, the charity that runs the homeless shelter. “We were overwhelmed with its success.”Closed since 2011, the hospital is slated for redevelopment into a new neighbourhood with eco credentials, private and social housing, shops, commercial and public facilities and green space. Planning, clearance and construction on such a large scale takes time and, rather than leave the 3.4-hectare site empty for years, the developer, Paris Batignolles Aménagement, opened it to local organisations rent-free. The lease was scheduled to end this year, but has been extended until mid-2020 while construction begins on other parts of the site.Les Grands Voisins is an example of a “meanwhile space”: a disused site temporarily leased or loaned by developers or the public sector to local community groups, arts organisations, start-ups and charities. Calls for making use of such spaces in other crowded urban centres are getting louder. A report published in October by the thinktank Centre for London highlights both the need for and positive possibilities of utilising empty urban sites and how this could transform the landscape of cities around the globe.“The aim was to show the value ‘meanwhile use’ can add in cities where there is pressure on space,” says Nicolas Bosetti, one of the report researchers. He says public and private operators in Paris are more ambitious than those in London in exploring the use of disused buildings from metro stations to former nightclubs for short-term use as charity and cultural venues.Other meanwhile spaces in Paris include Exelmans, a former police residence repurposed as a shelter for the homeless and refugees, run by Aurore on a two-year lease, and the Parmentier electricity substation, where the art collective La Générale has operated since 2008.The substation, which is soon to be redeveloped, was included in Paris Reinvented, an initiative from the mayor’s office currently in its second year. Disused public sites are put up for auction to developers and architects who compete with plans for their redevelopment. “Les Grands Voisins showed how something like this can change an area and help plan future urban projects,” says Marion Waller, adviser to Paris’s deputy mayor for urban planning. “We didn’t want to sell buildings to the highest bidder but to the most innovative solution.”The idea of loaning empty urban spaces to worthwhile causes is gaining ground elsewhere, with thriving projects in the Danish city of Aarhus and Philadelphia in the US, where it’s called “temporary urbanism”. However, in space-squeezed London, urban sites can remain empty for years, mainly because they have no obvious commercial potential or are waiting for permission to be developed.The Centre for London found that an estimated 24,400 commercial properties in London are currently empty, with around half having been unused for more than two years. The total available vacant space, 6.5m sq metres, is equivalent to 27 times the footprint of Westfield London, Europe’s largest shopping centre. The majority of such places are owned by local authorities and developers. “Only one of 33 London borough councils publishes a database of vacant property and only one council keeps a list of groups interested in vacant spaces,” says Bosetti.Bosetti thinks property owners could do more to match available sites with needy groups but says local authorities are afraid of squatters or allowing in destructive elements. “One of the main barriers to meanwhile use is the perception that hoarding a site is safer,” he says. “Often the opposite is true. Opening a site to a community and encouraging interaction with residents usually sees a reduction in antisocial activity.”Squatting and vandalism are more likely if a building remains empty for too long, so one benefit of temporary tenants is the reduction in security costs. Another, according to Simon Hesketh, director of regeneration with the British developer U+I, is the connection a meanwhile space can forge with the community prior to redevelopment.“We’ll try to organise events in temporary spaces for the widest cross-section of residents, to get their views and ask what they’d like and what works,” he says. “Not just to smooth the planning process, but because we can learn what we might include in our proposals.”U+I, one of the sponsors of the Centre for London report, has already leased several sites awaiting redevelopment to small businesses and community organisations for temporary use. Hesketh acknowledges property owners worry about reclaiming the space when the tenancy ends but says everyone involved needs to be clear that the situation is temporary.The Migration Museum in Lambeth is currently occupying part of the former engine workshop for the London fire service. “Having this site has been totally transformative for us,” says director Sophie Henderson. “It has allowed us to prove the concept of what we’re doing, while we look for a permanent home.”The building is slated for redevelopment by U+I into a mixed-use scheme but is still going through the planning process. Until construction starts, the museum is one of several thriving community organisations granted the option to use it. “It’s been a tremendous gift,” says Henderson. “We couldn’t possibly have done what we have in the past year without it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb23c025479b2a9eb579a05d2422190a6534c78/0_368_2369_1422/master/2369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef1d30ce5399b7792031f774d553364","title":"emmanuel macron populism french president","story":"The French president hasn’t just lost his touch, he is enabling the populism he was supposed to defeatI was on a train from Bratislava to Budapest recently when I found myself contemplating France and its recent predicament. The purpose of my journey through central Europe was to observe the seeds of the “illiberal democracy” that is proclaimed by Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, and challenged by Emmanuel Macron. I’d travelled from my mature democracy to a region of Europe where autocratic nationalists have firmed up their power by playing on people’s fears and resentment.My perspective is that of a privileged French woman born on the right side of the iron curtain. I come from the birthplace of human rights, and was going to talk with people who have elected leaders who oppose the values of public freedom and tolerance of difference, equality between women and men, checks and balances – everything that represents the strength and unity of Europe. My country France is governed by a young, democratic and charismatic president. And so I felt affection, sadness and anxiety for them, as they were not lucky enough to live on our side of the continent.But it was also on that train that I read about the events taking place in France: the “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) protests. I saw the anger and distress of a middle class hounded out of gentrified cities, caught out by the disappearance of public services and local shops, knocked for six by unemployment, and pushed to the limit by a threadbare purchasing power.What I also saw was the political expression of hateful violence – racist and homophobic, with echoes of France’s 1950s populist “poujadist” movement. This was the simmering violence of a country split down the middle between the towns and the suburbs, between elites and the common people, between the winners and losers of globalisation a country on the verge of exploding, characterised by the resentment and radicalisation that have been piling up year by year.The train made a stop in Visegrád, the birthplace of the Visegrád Group – the coalition of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which has become notorious for rejecting any form of European solidarity over migrants. Macron pointed the finger at the Visegrád Group when he denounced the “populist and nationalist leprosy” on the rise in Europe.The trouble is, this young president has now lost touch. Pulling in to Visegrád station, my anxiety changed direction. Where is the leprosy? Is it in Europe’s east or west? For those who, like myself, see no other solution than a unified Europe in a globalised world, a Europe facing China and Russia and deprived of the support of the United States, Macron was like a gift from heaven. In 2017 the uproarious French presidential election had at one point seemed likely to come down to a showdown between Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who have more similarities than differences – particularly in their shared hatred of the EU. The man who beat both was this reformer who came out of the blue with neither a party nor a political base.In a politically moribund landscape, Macron was the sole bearer of optimistic values – the opposite of populist parties that feed off their hatred of the system and elites. And yet he conquered the Elysée by defending as a priority the unpopular European project – a high-risk strategy.Our presidents have often been laden with an original sin. Nicolas Sarkozy remained tainted by an early episode in which he holidayed on a billionaire’s yacht, and François Hollande’s image was tarnished by his initial fiscal policies. Macron has lost – paradoxically – by forgetting his own “at the same time” slogan: tax handouts to rich investors (a flat tax on capital) were not balanced by a gesture to France’s poorest. It slipped his mind. And he hadn’t realised that a large proportion of middle-class people were at the end of their tether.His phrases stigmatising “people who are nothing” and claiming “I only have to cross the street and I can find you a job” didn’t help, and the diesel revolt was the final straw. Because of his political inexperience, his intellectual arrogance, his hubris, and by taking himself for a solitary Jupiterian hero, Macron has locked himself into the image of the president of the rich. Now, France – which prefers equality to freedom – is slapping him in the face.Macronism was magnificent – but so far it has failed. I get the feeling of a huge waste. Walking down the Champs Elysées last Sunday and seeing the rioters’ destruction from the night before offered a hint of what we have ended up with. The most anti-populist leader France could have hoped for finds himself actually reinforcing populism.

Theresa May’s deal does not “ get on with it” as she claims. In the vague political declaration about the future relationship there are many more volcanoes ready to erupt after next March. They will be erupting for years to come. A no-deal Brexit would lead to more immediate explosions with dire long-term consequences. Neither route gives voters greater control of their lives or binds those who have been “left behind”, two themes of the referendum. Both guarantee that there will be no moving on from Brexit.The third option of a people’s vote is incomparably more preferable, in that it could lead to a sensible solution. But this Brexit route is also long and thorny. I went on the packed People’s Vote march in London last month and spoke at the equivalent rally in Edinburgh during the festival in August. The case is powerful and the campaign has been projected brilliantly. The argument is making more headway than many imagined possible even a few months ago. Yet the very success of the campaign highlights its flaw. The focus is inevitably on the case for a referendum rather than the arguments for remaining in the EU. The case for remain is more powerful than ever after more than two years of unresolved madness.Indeed, since 2016 we have learned that of all the EU countries the UK is least suited to leave because of Ireland and other matters. While the case for staying in is much clearer now than in 2016, the arguments for a referendum become more blurred. The most basic obstacle is reaching any consensus on the options to be proposed on the ballot paper. Some in the People’s Vote campaign suggest the choice should be between May’s deal and remain as they are the only substantial clearly realised choices available. But a significant number of Brexiteer MPs will vote against May’s deal in the Commons. Obviously they do not support remain. They and the voters they represent would be disenfranchised in such a referendum. The hardline Brexiteers find the responsibilities of government impossibly awkward, daunted by compromise, complexity and detail. In contrast they are near geniuses at developing “betrayal narratives” from the back benches. A referendum with two choices that they opposed would not take a genius to fuel wild disillusionment.In his recent interview with Andrew Marr, Tony Blair was forensic in his demolition of May’s deal and in his arguments about why he supports remain. When he moved on to the case for the people’s vote he was far less clear. Blair suggested there were two options. One was “Boris Johnson’s version of Brexit” versus remain. The other was a three-choice referendum, those two plus May’s deal. His preference was for the first, remain versus a Boris Johnson Brexit. But Johnson’s version of Brexit has not been negotiated. He seeks some form of “Canada-plus-plus-plus” , a free trade agreement with substantial extras that the EU would almost certainly not agree to. In terms of the people’s vote this raises two issues. Does the campaign take place on the assumption that if Johnson’s Brexit version won the negotiation would follow. In which case what happens if the EU rejects large chunks of Johnson’s version, which they would? The referendum would be similar to 2016 as the precise form Brexit might take would be unclear. But if a referendum is delayed until Johnson or his equivalent negotiates his Brexit version the UK could be waiting for years.The issue of what is put on the ballot paper would take some time to resolve with any legitimising consensus. In the meantime the case for remain would not get much of a look-in. The legitimacy of the referendum would be the main topics of debate before and probably during the campaign.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.This has started to happen already. The remainers in the Commons tend to ask May for a people’s vote rather than challenging her with the case for staying in. May, who struggles with questions of substance about the benefits of continued EU membership, deals with these interventions with ease. She says there was a people’s vote in 2016 and she is implementing it. There is an obvious rejoinder. That referendum was an absurd way of addressing a matter of such multilayered complexity. Yet proposing another referendum legitimises the original one as a method of addressing these policy areas.The “Brexit betrayal” narrative is unavoidable whatever route is taken. Brexiteers will claim betrayal if May’s deal somehow or other wins the day. When chaos follows a no deal they will argue from the safety of the back benches that they would have prepared for such an outcome in ways that would have magically avoided the economy-wrecking disruption. Given that disillusionment is built into Brexit there is a clearer way forward than holding a referendum. Parliament could decide. In the paralysis that follows the defeat of May’s deal a brave and wise parliament would vote to revoke article 50 and stop Brexit.MPs who know that continued EU membership is by far the best solution are understandably fearful of such a move because it so overtly counters the 2016 referendum. But a parliamentary solution has the big advantage of ending the immediate Brexit pain swiftly. Given that the legitimacy of a referendum would also be challenged ferociously, the protective shield for MPs is not that much greater and the pain would last much longer. Some MPs are also exploring the possibility of a “Norway-plus” option, including membership of the customs union and single market. The option has many merits but as Brexiteers would argue that is a betrayal too, the UK might as well remain rule-makers in the EU rather than rule-takers just outside.If they voted to revoke article 50, MPs could sincerely point to the two years of costly, sweaty, energy-sapping around-the-clock attempts to deliver Brexit as proof they gave it an almighty go. Some voters will be apoplectic but they will fume in every scenario. At least an assumption of parliamentary responsibility would solve the thorny questions immediately. If parliament rejects May’s deal and no deal, which it should, parliament has a duty to sort it out and could do so by Christmas. No doubt MPs would be vilified, as they will be unfairly whatever happens.Still, think about it, no raging debate about what the question should be in a referendum, no more backstops, no threat to the soft border, no cliff’s edge after another row about how long the transition should last and what should follow, no uncertainty about future trading arrangements, no choice between being a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker, the stage cleared for a focus on bigger challenges such as the NHS, hopeless trains and the rest. Such a clear and transparent assertion of representative democracy almost certainly will not happen but it is the only way to “get on with it”.• Steve Richards is a political columnist and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b7ae12d5bbf24ecc9880447e16cbe74fb15f787/0_91_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26121789cf3517763024e84c2b2437cc","title":"frictionless unicorns max fac brexit lingo","story":"The language of politics is becoming increasingly esoteric and ridiculous. Just like the Brexit shambles itselfFirst, an apology. Because this piece is about Brexit, which haunts all of our days like a hangover that simply will not shift. A hangover after, say, a full-bodied Malbec or an earthy Pilsner. As the EU agrees Theresa May’s 585-page Brexit plan, and with the UK parliamentary vote to take place on 11 December ensuring yet more furious conjecture and debate, let us go over the ridiculous words and terms that have become part of the national lexicon, and which make us collectively stuff our fists into our mouths to scream silently on a daily basis. Enjoy!I’d hardly heard the word backstop since my days of playing rounders at school, yet I’ve heard it every single day for the past month, and – this is where the real will to live is lost – even the phrase “the backstop to the backstop”. Quite frankly I am jealous of everyone who managed to catch syphilis in the 18th century and was put out of their misery.This is all to do with the Irish border, and the Tories’ initial reluctance to accept the Good Friday agreement was actually quite good (or in the case of the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, not understanding it all. A primer is here). The backstop will come into play only if a trade deal is not secured within the transition period, which, going on previous form, it will not be. If anyone had the slightest optimism that the entire shambles would be wrapped up before deadline, the backstop might be less of a contentious issue.When I worked on the  tech desk, I was used to hearing extremely successful startups (valued at more than $1 billion) described as unicorns. Tech companies are also tied up with Brexit, owing to the fact that investment will almost certainly take a hit post-withdrawal. But Labour brought us back to the actual idea of the fantasy animal when the head of the thinktank Open Europe said of Labour’s Brexit stance (if you can call it that): “Because it’s opposition politics, they can promise unicorns without worrying about having to deliver them.” Amazon Prime will probably find a way soon, though.The former UK ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, has also described UK ambitions for “a fantasy island unicorn model”.Sounds like a voluminous mascara, but is in fact shorthand for “maximum facilitation”, the Tories’ proposed hi-tech solution on checks across the Irish border (see above). This despite the fact the Tories have an awful record on tech, and probably open separate browser windows instead of just using tabs.Johnson, in his capacity as then foreign secretary (still lol) replied that “I think ‘to go whistle’ is an entirely appropriate expression.” Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone later stuck his neck out further to say that the EU can “absolutely go whistle”. Fighting talk.We’re not talking about Harry Potter’s study periods, but about another fair accusation from the EU on the UK government’s Brexit negotiations position. Once again, the Irish border was the culprit (it’s almost as if nobody thought about this massive issue beforehand), and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, had absolutely had it, saying: “What we see in the UK paper is a lot of magical thinking about how an invisible border would work in the future.”Now we await some more awful neologisms in the lead up to the Commons vote. It’s almost enough to make one want to speak in a different language. A European one, perhaps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d008f04e3013faf0c4ea1334d38b102764091b7/0_126_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629924bb8c0e36b0e88d4e9877baf556","title":"tell us was 2018 the year you woke up to climate change","story":"We’d like to know if you changed your opinion on climate change and whether there was a moment that convinced you of its impactThis year has seen more than 200 natural disaster events take place across the world.

It said the company had to institute a complete cultural change, make a commitment to improving bioersity and realise that the safety of the railway would not be compromised by better protection of the environment.The Department for Transport issued statements in advance of the full publication of the report.The rail minister, Andrew Jones, called on Network Rail to produce an action plan in six months to spell out how it would protect bioersity andavoid excessive tree felling in the nesting season next year.“The thousands of miles of line-side vegetation and wildlife on our rail network are valuable assets which need protection because of the environmental benefits they bring,” said Jones. “This is about cultural change across the whole network.”But the Woodland Trust, which has pushed for Network Rail to pull back from the scale of tree felling it carries out, particularly in the nesting season, called for the government to fast track implementation of the recommendations. The charity said the government should create enforcement powers to make sure the rail company made the required changes to its approach.“The report is unapologetic in highlighting the significant problems currently experienced in Network Rail’s approach to line-side vegetation management,” said Nick Atkinson, senior conservation adviser for the charity. “Its conclusion that Network Rail does not take in to account accepted environmental best practice throughout all its estate is alarming, and urgently needs addressing.Network Rail is not obliged to follow the recommendations in the review unless the government takes up the call by the Woodland Trust to create enforcement powers.The review was commissioned by Jo Johnson, then rail minister, earlier this year after  revelations that Network Rail was considering a draft five-year plan to remove all leaf-fall species along its tracks.The rail firm said it had not adopted the plan that outlined an “enhanced clearance” of line-side vegetation.Last spring, tree felling across the country in the nesting season led to criticism from the public in several areas.The chair of the review, John Varley, an experienced land manager, said the environment along the railway lines had evolved over decades. “If laid out end to end, it would stretch over halfway around the circumference of the earth,” said Varley. “This is a valuable and nationally important natural asset … my review’s recommendations should lead to a significant improvement in the environmental impact of the railway.“The time is right for Network Rail to not only be one of the safest railways in Europe but the greenest, too, by valuing nature and providing a railway for people and wildlife.”Network Rail owns 6m trees and 13m trees are within falling distance of its tracks, some on third-party land and some alongside the rail lines. It cuts down about 1,000 trees a week, according to its own figures.Last year, there were an estimated 1,500 incidents of rail disruption due to trees and bad weather.Andrew Haines, Network Rail’s chief executive, said an action plan would be developed over the next six months to deliver the recommendations. “We will also improve the way we operate to better protect nesting birds, ready for next year’s breeding season,” said Haines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed53c3d5a97db12ee69ee721c8987a5f2ebc277f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44caa6c6b643cdc1f1e8a8bfeffea76","title":"guide party dressing men velvet dicky bows mortarboards","story":"Whether you channel Timothée Chalamet in a tux or keep it casual à la Ralph Lauren in jeans, there are plenty of glad rag options on the high street.

I know he is happy here, I know he wants to stay, and I know the board are working to make that happen.”Luke Shaw also praised De Gea’s contribution, though was honest enough to admit United should have been coasting by then. “We had the chances to be three or four goals in front but we still needed that unbelievable save from David,” the full-back said.Mourinho accepted that his side “suffered a lot” in qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage with a game to spare, and claimed “relief and frustration” were behind his histrionic reaction to the winning goal, where he kicked and threw drinks crates on the touchline. “We don’t score enough goals and it makes things difficult, but all my players were very tired at the end and I like that,” he explained.” “I want them to give everything.”There was a suggestion of handball in the only goal, though naturally the player involved denied it. “It touched my hand, but for me it was not handball,” Fellaini argued. Mourinho had the last word, as he so often does, by pointing to his record in Europe: “This is my 14th season in the Champions League, and the 14th time my team has qualified for the knockout stage,” he said. “In two other seasons I was in the Europa League and both times I won it.

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“What’s the fastest debut goal from signing to scoring? Has anyone ever joined a club at midnight on transfer deadline day and scored the next day?” asks Harry Turner.Opta don’t keep data for this sort of thing, but thankfully the memory banks of our readers are full of the stuff. “Luis Suárez signed for Liverpool in the afternoon of 31 January 2011,” writes Ruaraidh Gillies. “He scored against Stoke on his debut two days later, on 2 February, and was only officially unveiled to the press the following day.”Impressive stuff, but there are some examples of players who have signed and scored on the same day. Richard Slater highlights the Italian striker Marco Branca, who scored a vital goal in the fourth minute of his debut for Middlesbrough against Liverpool in the 1998 League Cup semi-final. “According to the commentary on the YouTube clip, he signed four hours earlier,” writes Richard. “The goal was the winning goal in the tie so this could also qualify as the high point of his brief Boro career.”Scott Sinclair did something similar when he joined Celtic from Aston Villa in 2016. Nicholas Moore points out that he signed on 7 August and scored the winner against Hearts on the same day after coming off the bench.From Scotland to the president of Liberia. “It was announced on 11 January 2000 that George Weah would be joining Chelsea on loan from Milan until the end of the season,” writes Kraig Dixon. “However, he did not receive international clearance until just before 5pm the following day, meaning he stepped off a plane from Italy and made his way straight to Stamford Bridge for the game against Spurs. He came off the bench just before the hour and scored a fairytale 87th-minute winner.”Though Branca, Sinclair and Weah all troubled the onion bag on the same day they joined a new club, none of them did so as quickly as Wigan’s Callum Connolly. “On 14 January 2017, Wigan announced their starting XI to face Burton at 2pm – without mentioning it had new loan signing Callum Connolly in it,” mails Danny Jamieson. “They then announced Connolly’s signing from Everton at 2.03pm. And of course he scored on his debut at 3.48pm, so officially that’s less than two hours between signing and scoring.”Can anyone top that?

In this 2009 Joy of Six, Scott Murray takes up the story:Rovers had deserved to win the game. Kevin Moran was unjustly sent off for the home side – even Ian Rush, who Moran sent tumbling to the ground as they both chased a long ball, thought the decision harsh. Rovers were still a goal to the good, but the minutes added for Moran’s red card would prove costly. Deep into injury-time, Ray Houghton flung in a ball from the right, Gary Gillespie failed to connect, and the unsighted Mark Atkins deflected the ball into his own net.Liverpool had escaped with a draw – but only, as Jimmy Hill noted on BBC television after the final whistle, because an over-eager Ewood Park ballgirl had returned the ball to the visitors with indecent haste, allowing Houghton to quickly instigate the move which did for Rovers. Hill was, of course, technically right – but in the final analysis, blaming unpaid workers for the failings of professional footballers is a bit off. And Hill a union man as well.

He had standing, qualifications and coaching experience but simply could not nail down a job, and such was his desperation to do so he claimed he would be willing to work for free. “I’m up for that,” Campbell said. “I’m itching to start, I just need a chance, even just an interview in which I can say: ‘Take me for free and I’ll show you what I can do.’”Fast-forward 16 months and Campbell has finally made his breakthrough having being appointed manager of Macclesfield Town on Tuesday. The deal is for 18 months and it is safe to presume he is getting paid for the job of lifting the club away from the foot of League Two. Quite right, too, because Campbell should never have actually had to work for free and, in light of managerial appointments elsewhere, it can be argued he should been given such an opportunity much sooner.Because while Ryan Giggs, Joey Barton, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard have walked into jobs of great standing, real potential or both during the past 11 months, Campbell has had to deal with the frustration of being turned down by the likes of Oxford United, Grimsby and Oldham despite having at least as strong credentials as his aforementioned contemporaries.That is certainly the case in relation to Barton, who was appointed manager of League One Fleetwood Town in April despite serving a 13-month ban from football for betting offences. The former midfielder started work the day after the ban ended and has led Fleetwood to a respectable 13th place, but that does not take away from the sense that when it comes to managerial opportunities in this country it all too often comes down to who you know and what you look like.Cue a rolling of eyes and shouts of ‘race card’ in some quarters but it requires only a glance at the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) managers working across this country’s 92 professional clubs to see there is a problem. Before Tuesday the number stood at seven – Chris Hughton at Brighton, Nuno Espírito Santo at Wolves, Darren Moore at West Brom, Jos Luhukay at Sheffield Wednesday, Chris Powell at Southend United, Dino Maamria at Stevenage Town and Keith Curle at Northampton Town – and while Campbell’s appointment is encouraging in that regard, the fact it took this long is damning.After all, this is a man who, as well as being one of the finest players of his generation, under one of the most innovative and successful managers of the modern era in Arsène Wenger, has a Uefa pro licence and international coaching experience, having been part of Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago’s backroom staff during their attempt to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Yet he still could not get hired during an era when a lack of experience and even a ban from the Football Association were clearly no barriers to doing so. As the Independent’s chief sports writer, Jonathan Liew, wrote in a recent column on the lack of BAME representation in English football, “you don’t need to play the race card if you’re already winning the game”.There are no guarantees Campbell will be a success at Macclesfield and, I’m not going to lie, I have concerns about his man-management skills. My dealings with him, on the King’s Road and elsewhere, were always fine but he can be as frosty as he seems from a distance, and you have to wonder whether that type of demeanour will work with a group of players who probably need an arm round the shoulder as much as a kick up the backside right now.Equally, the claim that Campbell is too unorthodox to succeed as a manager is absurd, pointing to the character tests that only people from certain backgrounds have to pass to secure a job in football. Being unorthodox has not, for instance, stopped Ian Holloway from getting work in this country, or for that matter, Marcelo Bielsa.Campbell is no Bielsa, of course, or for that matter Holloway, but that is because, at 44, he is only now starting his managerial career having recently enhanced his CV by working with England Under-21s as part of the Football Association’s ‘In Pursuit of Progress’ initiative. The hope must be that he has arrived at Macclesfield with his eyes fully open to the challenge of taking over a club seven points from safety and in severe need of direction having been without a manager since early October.Campbell at least has history on his side. Two other BAME managers, Paul Ince and Keith Alexander, achieved success as well as popularity at Moss Rose, and while Campbell will rightly want to be judged on his own terms there is no getting away from the significance of his appointment.This is a man who once claimed “archaic attitudes” in this country could ultimately force him to seek a manager’s post abroad. He now has a chance to shine on these shores. About time, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e5c3f3fee464c717aa65ad8ad7a1d04037e7ef7/9_0_4876_2927/master/4876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18f6435e7a1185f4b9f3e3a5992e36c7","title":"joe montemurro bumps arsenal wsl women","story":"Arsenal’s Australian coach fixed a leaky defence then introduced ‘balance and management’ to startling effectHow do you build a buccaneering team who sweep away all before them? A team who suffer a 3-1 cup final defeat by invincible double winners but demolish them 5-0 in their next meeting to maintain an unbeaten start to a new season?Joe Montemurro’s three-quarter season in charge at Arsenal was about laying the foundations for just such a transformation. Working without expectations with a team laden with stars – not least four Dutch European Championship winners – but lacking direction, the Australian set about his task.“We work to a system and to a style that creates a foundation,” says Montemurro in London Colney just shy of a year on from our first interview days after he landed in the capital. “You could call it defensive stability we call it more balance and management. We balance and manage the situation when we don’t have the ball, in order to regain the ball, and then when we’ve got the ball we try to keep it. Within that we have certain patterns and structures that we try to achieve to unlock an opposing team.”In his first season the initial task was shoring up a leaky defence. Eight goals conceded in three league games under Pedro Martínez Losa became a nine-game unbeaten run with eight clean sheets.A positive approach to play when out of possession, Montemurro says, was the key: “We do it in a productive way that suits our style. We’re always front-footed in our defending – it’s proactive defending to win the ball as high up as we can. And then having the mechanisms to deal with it lower if they do beat that line. There are some certain balance and management things that create the framework for my players to be creative and imaginative.”He makes it sound easy and the transition seems to have been smooth, with the players extolling the virtues of his methods, philosophy and demeanour.How the manager has handled the bumps on his road has been vital to maintaining harmony. “There’s always difficult patches when you instil belief and a philosophy and I’m a bit hard-headed with the way I want to play and the way I want to do things,” he says. “Sometimes players fall into old habits and situations, and it’s not their fault.“It’s important to identify those moments and put them in situations where they understand that moment and what we are trying to do with our philosophy.”Arsenal scored 16 goals in their first three games and although West Ham gave them a scare, twice taking the lead before losing 4-3, the first big test of how far they had come was the visit to Chelsea in mid-October.“You want me to ulge secrets, don’t you?” says Montemurro, laughing, when asked to break down their 5-0 demolition of the champions. “They have players that work in half-areas. They have players that are very difficult to mark. You look at their top three of Drew Spence, Ramona Bachmann and Fran Kirby, they work in between lines and so we had too be a lot smarter, in terms of finding a balance between marking them and marking space too. We always thought if we were smart enough in that, we would find space going forward.”Chelsea began on the front foot, though, with Ji So-yun and Kirby combining dangerously to trouble the Arsenal backline. Within minutes the hosts carved out their first opening, Kirby squaring to Adelina Engman but the French goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin was equal to her shot.“Even after the chance that they missed early on, I didn’t feel uncomfortable because I knew where it was coming from, what was happening and how we could fix it,” Montemurro says. “We were a little bit, I wouldn’t say negative, probably a little more patient in our buildup and patient when they had the ball too. We needed to assess the situation because when we regained it, we needed to understand where and when to go forward. It worked.“I’ll go to the emotional side because it was a big game for us. It was our first big game, we hadn’t played them since the FA Cup final, so I think there was some emotional settling for us to do. That caused that chance more than them being better than us. We guarded spaces a little more, rather than being proactive and forward thinking.“It was just a matter of us getting into our rhythm. We just didn’t get our spaces right, we didn’t get our distances right. Once we got that right it was fine. Our distances were too compact, we weren’t giving ourselves enough breathing space to play and when that changed we started to play our way.”With a two-goal lead at the break it would have been easy for any team to continue to sit back a little and look to catch Chelsea on the counter, but instead Arsenal grew in dominance.“It changed a bit because the distances got longer and that suits us. When teams get longer because they have to go for the game, the distances get longer and we started to find spaces in between and control the game because when we got on the ball we kept it more easily.”Was it the complete performance? “We’re still to have the complete performance,” Montemurro says. “There have been ebbs and flows in all games that we assess and look to fix. And does the complete performance exist? I don’t know, this is a very tough league.”On Sunday, the leaders visit their closest rivals, Manchester City, with a team slightly stunted by injury, having a chance to pull nine points clear – a hefty gap for rivals to close halfway through a 20-game league season.• Rangers’ board announced at their AGM that they will be tripling their investment in women’s football. A statement read: “We have not given enough financial and other support to our women footballers. Initiatives are being put in place to redress this historical imbalance.”• Last week Der Spiegel and Football Leaks exposed a clause in Women’s Super League contracts which states that clubs can sack players if out injured for three or more months. In contrast, men’s players can be injured for 18 months before they can have their contract terminated, giving men six times longer to heal and recover without the risk of the sack.• Support across football has flooded in for 18-year-old goalkeeper Jordan Dawes, who suffered a stroke. Dawes, who plays in the fifth tier for Kent Football United, has received messages from players such as Carly Telford and Fran Kirby, as well as gloves and a signed shirt from David de Gea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e3e4218fb1292121c113de2942c891485fda35/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9b9e14d5b648a4d28c4e48f5bf043bd","title":"who can afford ivf treatments fertility class","story":"Private foundations are now helping couples and iniduals seeking fertility treatments in a country where IVF costs more than anywhere else on earthIn 2016, after seven years trying to conceive, New York state assembly member Rodneyse Bichotte was pregnant with twins. At 13 weeks, she lost one in a miscarriage. At five months, she went into preterm labor, and rushed to a New York hospital.Doctors turned her away, saying they couldn’t give her a bed because of insurance issues and because it was against “hospital policy” to admit pregnant women before 23 weeks. She was driven to another hospital, where her baby, Jonah Bichotte Cowan, died shortly after birth.Now 45, with nine in vitro fertilization cycles behind her, and close to $200,000 spent on procedures and medications, Bichotte is determined to be pregnant again.After she reached her insurance policy’s limit, Bichotte spent $30,000 of her savings for one last cycle. When that failed, her doctor recommended trying donor eggs, a procedure that typically starts at $25,000.“Even with the insurance coverage, there were a lot of other fees that I had to pay out of pocket,” Bichotte told me. “I just was drained.”Her savings account emptied, and she turned to charity. In May of this year, she was awarded a $15,000 grant from Baby Quest, one of several dozen not-for-profit organizations that offer financial assistance to couples and iniduals seeking fertility treatment in a country where it costs more than anywhere else on earth.Americans are having trouble making babies. In 2017, the birth rate hit a record low, while the gap between how many children women say they want to have (2.7) and how many they will likely have (1.8) widened to a 40-year high. In a recent survey, Americans said economic factors – the cost of child care, the lack of paid leave, and general financial insecurity – influenced the decision to have fewer children, a phenomenon some scholars have labeled “structural infertility”.As in European countries, Americans, especially women, are pursuing more education, marrying later, and bearing children later. In 2017, birth rates fell for teenagers and women in their 20s and 30s, but rose for women in their 40s, a period when their fertility is on the wane.Medical infertility, defined as an inability to achieve pregnancy after one year of trying, affected an estimated 48.5 million couples globally in 2010, rich and poor alike, according to a 2012 study from the World Health Organization. In her new memoir Becoming, Michelle Obama describes being “inordinately lucky” that her health insurance at the University of Chicago covered most of the cost of the IVF she and Barack needed to conceive their two daughters. “It felt like having a high-stakes lottery ticket, only with science involved,” she wrote.All of these patterns suggest demand for IVF, egg-freezing, and other assisted reproductive technologies, or ARTs, will continue to grow, a trend that has lured a wave of private equity money into the sector. But as the need grows, so have costs.Explanations vary as to why fertility treatment has become so expensive in the US, apart from the overall high cost of healthcare. Dr James Grifo, the director of NYU’s Langone fertility center, said fertility drugs have become the biggest cost barrier, but also noted that many of the basic ingredients of an IVF procedure have become more costly. “Our reagents, our culture medias, our laboratory equipment, those things have all gone up significantly,” he said.Still, for many, the instinct to reproduce lurks deep in our genetic material. When resources or insurance coverage permit, couples and iniduals go to great lengths to conceive – pursuing multiple rounds of IVF, procuring eggs from donors, or hiring gestational surrogates to carry a pregnancy on their behalf. (Including legal and other fees, surrogacy can cost well over $100,000 if done domestically.)“And if they don’t get pregnant, which many don’t even in the best programs, they don’t have the baby – but they still have the debt.”David and Jennifer Bross were also fortunate. She worked for an employer based in Illinois, one of just nine states that mandate insurance plans cover infertility treatment.A year after the birth of their twins through IVF, they founded Parental Hope with $2,000 of their own money and an employer match of $1,250, which they used to set up the not-for-profit and host their first fundraiser. Since January 2016, Parental Hope has provided 24 grants, each covering a full cycle of IVF, but not the medications or add-on procedures such as genetic testing.“We don’t want people to have to go into financial debt to have a family,” said Bross, who holds a large annual fundraising event in Cincinnati during National Infertility Awareness Week, and smaller events throughout the year. “You shouldn’t have to go out and take loans or borrow money or sell your car or whatever people do in order to make up tens of thousands of dollars in fertility treatments just to have a child.”Pamela Hirsch was among the first franchisees of the Princeton Review test preparation company, which raised $59m when it went public in 2001. When her younger daughter learned, after three years of invasive, unsuccessful fertility treatments, that she had a bicornuate uterus and would need to use a gestational surrogate, Hirsch and her husband Miles offered to help pay for it. Their generosity produced two granddaughters.Hirsch started Baby Quest in 2011 with around $50,000 of her own money this past November, it surpassed $1.3m in financial assistance, a figure that includes cash grants for treatment, medications supplied, waived legal fees and discounts it negotiates with doctors on behalf of grantees. Hirsch receives mostly small donations from iniduals, although she has started receiving larger donations from corporations and foundations.“What bothers me is … this is an issue of class,” said Hirsch, who runs Baby Quest from her Los Angeles home. “I don’t think it’s ever fair to say to someone, ‘You can’t afford to have a child.’”In the US, 37 not-for-profits offer financial assistance for fertility treatment, according to a forthcoming paper coauthored by Dr Eve Feinberg, a reproductive endocrinologist at Northwestern University. Half of these not-for-profits, many volunteer-run, have sprung up in the past decade the oldest has been around for a quarter century.The paper found wide variation in the assistance offered, population served, and types of services covered. Some fertility not-for-profits are just for Jewish people others only help patients of a certain clinic. Some welcome singles, others target couples. Some will subsidize elective egg freezing one is dedicated exclusively to funding medical egg-freezing, which women undertake before undergoing fertility-threatening treatments such as chemotherapy.The nature of the reward, and the eligibility criteria, also varies between charities.Baby Quest, which is open to permanent residents in the US, including non-citizens, offers medication donated by Ferring and EMD Serono, two manufacturers of the medications used in assisted reproduction procedures, and also gets discounted pricing from certain pharmacies. Its monetary awards, given twice yearly, cover most of the treatment costs, but Hirsch likes to see potential parents put a little financial skin in the game. She also calls clinics to ask for discounted treatment sometimes a doctor lops a few thousand off the bill.Other fertility not-for-profits, like Parental Hope, direct patients to a specific clinic. With the discounted rate offered to Parental Hope by the Institute for Reproductive Health in Cincinnati, Bross can give out additional grants.Feinberg and her coauthors question the sustainability of this approach. “While private foundations have made an impact on the lives of many iniduals, a more permanent solution of increased insurance coverage for infertility services is greatly needed,” they wrote. A bill introduced in May, requiring insurers to cover infertility services, has stalled in Congress.What forms does one fill out to win money to have a baby? The foundations have similar application processes, typically requiring tax returns and other financial information, such as itemized monthly expenditures a cost breakdown of the required treatment medical forms completed by a doctor and a personal essay. A selection committee usually scores the materials.Hirsch, a former teacher, is sensitive to how the essay component of Baby Quest’s application puts less-educated candidates at a disadvantage, compared with applicants who have been to college, who “write these amazing essays”.“I could correct each essay with a ton of red marks, but the quality of the writing is not relevant,” Hirsch said. “It is the heart and spirit of the story.”In 2017, Parental Hope switched from requiring a personal essay to asking applicants to tell their story in a six-minute video, a format Bross said helps the organization “get a feel for who they are”.Dr Camille Hammond, who founded the Tinina Q Cade Foundation in 2005, used strategies from her medical training to design an evaluation process that could compensate for reviewers’ bias, with erse groups of reviewers who evaluate the medical, financial, and personal statement components separately.For applicants desperate for a chance to conceive, however, the application process can be agonizing.Tiffany Barker, 33, is a special education teacher living in Los Angeles with her husband Pat, a writer and comedian. In February 2016, after nearly a year of trying to conceive, their doctor suggested IVF. Her first thought: “I’m never going to be able to afford this.”One of her best friends from high school sent her to the website of Resolve.org, a national fertility advocacy group, which listed available scholarship and grant opportunities. Filling out the forms and crafting personal statements for the applications, Barker said, “felt like applying to college all over again”.Barker, who was raised by a single mother and put herself through college and a master’s degree program with the help of student loans, worried about how to craft a compelling enough narrative, and whether her loans would count against her.“It was…like, is my story sad enough?” she remembers. “Are you going to judge me because I have student loans, and you think I’m not going to be a good enough parent because I have loans that I’ll have to pay back for the next twenty years?”Barker and her husband did consider adoption, a process that costs between $30,000 and $45,000 domestically, according to a recent survey by Adoptive Families magazine.“We had to have that conversation too – like, what’s the end game? What do we really want?” she said. “And we both just want to be parents.”The Barkers’ first application, to a now-defunct Texas charity, was rejected, and Tiffany cried when she got the email. In June 2016, when they learned their application to Baby Quest had been approved, Tiffany cried again.“That was the moment that my life was changing,” she said. “Someone felt like I would be a good enough mother to give me a chance. I have a perfect baby because of it.”The question of who is a “good enough” mother has been contested for centuries, but rarely is it put so explicitly to a jury of one’s peers. The people who administer fertility grants stress that nearly everyone who applies is deserving there is real pain in their voices when they discuss turning applicants down.But the eligibility requirements – indeed, the exclusive nature of fertility treatment itself – limit the number of people who might benefit. Many fertility organizations require an applicant have health insurance, to cover the costs of the pregnancy and birth. Applicants must earn enough to provide for a child, should the treatment work. And people often learn about grant opportunities through their fertility clinics.“The fertility clinic is problematic only because there’s a certain demographic that goes to get fertility treatments,” said Dr Hammond. “The really poor people self-select – they decide, this is something I’m not going to be able to do, so they opt out even before they begin.”For decades, feminist scholars have studied how structures and policies shape reproductive labor. In 1986, feminist scholar Shellee Colen coined the phrase “stratified reproduction” in a study of West Indian nannies working for wealthy New York families. Two decades later, London School of Economics sociology professor Charis Thompson described the political and social regimes that encourage some populations to reproduce while discouraging others as “selective pronatalism”.What does selective pronatalism look like in practice? Comedian and author Tina Fey captured one end of its spectrum in a 2011 New Yorker essay: “Four beautiful children named after kings and pieces of fruit are a way of saying, ‘I can afford a four-bedroom apartment and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in elementary-school tuition fees every year. How you livin’?’”At the other end, you have women like Rodneyse Bichotte, who, despite her education and elected office, was turned away by doctors who viewed her as, in her words, “some random black woman”.This summer, with her Baby Quest grant and $7,000 of her own money, Bichotte tried her luck with donor eggs, of which seven were produced. Five fertilized, three made it to the blastocyst stage, and only one was normal, but it grew too slowly.“I spent all that money for basically almost nothing,” she said.She is exploring what options remain with doctors at Weill Cornell Medicine.While her private struggle continues, Bichotte is waging two public campaigns to give others a better shot at reproduction. The Jonah Bichotte Cowan Law, a bill she put forward in July requiring hospitals to treat any woman experiencing early labor, will hopefully pass in the new year. Another bill she plans to cosponsor will require insurers operating in New York state to cover infertility treatments.“I think the solution is getting our states to cover IVF,” she said. “That’s how I can help contribute … to make this law that could change everybody’s lives.”This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project and the Puffin Foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also staked a claim.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The idea of a debate on the deal, which was formally endorsed by EU leaders in Brussels last weekend, emerged from No 10 this week, as May’s team struggle to get their arguments heard over a barrage of criticism in Westminster.They believe the prime minister would perform well, because she has been immersed in the detail of the 585-page withdrawal agreement containing the backstop proposal for Northern Ireland and the much shorter political declaration about Britain’s future relationship with the EU.The BBC has already begun its own preliminary work on potential general election night coverage, checking the availability of a studio for either a new vote or a second referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7f84ae0f4227696803ea40d6a9c948cd12d964e/95_0_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32300cdce0fc7e20ce19bf01ee93776c","title":"chancellor uk worse off brexit scenarios philip hammond","story":"As vote on Brexit deal looms, Philip Hammond says there is no version of leaving the EU that will increase prosperity• Follow the day’s politics news and reaction live updatesPhilip Hammond has said that the UK will be worse off “in pure economic terms” under all possible Brexit outcomes – including the prime minister’s own deal.Speaking on Wednesday morning, the chancellor gave strong hints the government had begun its contingency planning should it lose the vote in parliament on Theresa May’s Brexit deal negotiated with the EU.The latest  analysis suggests 94 Tory MPs have confirmed they will vote against the deal, with numbers likely to tip into three figures in the coming days.Hammond suggested the economic hit would be mitigated if the deal was clinched, rather than the UK leaving with no deal.Asked if all scenarios would have a cost, Hammond said: “If you look at this purely from an economic point of view, yes there will be a cost to leaving the European Union because there will be impediments to our trade.”Hammond said the deal would “absolutely minimise those costs” and would offer political benefits of being able to sign new trade deals and having new controls over fishing waters. “The economy will be slightly smaller in the prime minister’s preferred version,” he said.He said if the government loses the vote in parliament on 11 December, it would be in “uncharted political territory”. More than half of backbench Tory MPs who are not on the government payroll have committed to voting down the deal.Hammond said cabinet ministers would examine the reasons why MPs had voted against the deal and then try to forge consensus. “We will then have to sit down as a cabinet and a government and decide where to go on the basis of the vote, what we’ve seen in the vote and who has voted in which way because clearly we live in a democracy, parliament is sovereign,” he said.“If parliament makes a decision to reject the prime minister’s proposal, we will have to consider very carefully how to proceed.”Hammond said it was clear that many Brexit scenarios did not command a majority in parliament. “What is more difficult to discern is what there is a consensus for,” he said. “We are trying to build consensus around the prime minister’s plan … if that is rejected we will have to review the options.“We will have to look at the parliamentary arithmetic, look at what parliament has decided, and consider what is the best way to proceed.”Hammond, a former remainer who has argued on the need to mitigate the economic costs of Brexit, suggested he was not convinced by any of the other scenarios such as a Norway-style deal.“All of the other options have disadvantages and we have to look not only at the economy but also the need to heal a fractured nation. We will not be successful if we remain fundamentally ided and fractured on this issue.”The analysis that the government is publishing examines the 15-year impact on the economy and is expected to echo the findings of a leaked assessment from earlier this year that showed GDP would be hit.Hammond said the economy would continue to grow under May’s deal and the impact would be “very small” and would be “the optimum way of leaving the European Union and delivering on the result of the referendum”.The chancellor said the analysis would show that a no-deal exit would have a much higher impact on the economy than the deal the two sides have negotiated.“Becoming a fully independent country and trading as an independent country with the European Union introduces some level of friction in our trade,” he said. “Our commitment is to absolutely minimise that friction and we have got our European neighbours to agree, in this deal, that we will work together to do that.”Hammond said “looking purely at the economics, remaining in the single market would give us an economic advantage”, comments that are likely to rile Brexiters in his party.The government has been keen to stress the report, prepared by civil servants across Whitehall, constituted an analysis and not a forecast.The chancellor said the true cost of leaving the EU would not be known until a final future relationship was negotiated with the bloc. “The precise binding legal treaty text has still got to be negotiated and until that text is negotiated and locked down, there will be an element of uncertainty,” he said.The Labour MP Owen Smith, a supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “This has to be the first instance in the history of our country when the man in charge of our economy has recommended making it smaller so we have less to spend on the NHS, schools, the army or our transport infrastructure.”The chancellor also lambasted critics of the plan, saying that no one had come up with a better one. “This is by far the best way to leave the EU, by protecting our jobs and our prosperity,” he said.“This is our plan, we are promoting it to the British people and to our colleagues. Of course we are making contingency plans for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. But that is not something that anybody wants to see, it is not a good outcome for the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7105a9165ba908537b787eb56f0c0671b3ded29/0_377_5477_3286/master/5477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90776384e632156bc5f324f9782e191e","title":"labour seize second brexit vote option john mcdonnell","story":"Shadow chancellor says remain should be on ballot paper but ‘no deal’ should not• Follow the day’s politics news and reaction live updatesJohn McDonnell has said a second Brexit referendum “might be an option we seize upon”, admitting for the first time that remain should be on the ballot paper and insisting that “no deal” should not.The shadow chancellor said he would vote to remain in any new referendum and that offering the chance to vote on no deal would carry too high a risk.The comments, made at a  Live event, mark a shift in thinking from McDonnell, who had previously argued that the option to remain should not be on the ballot paper for any fresh referendum on the Brexit deal.Those comments sparked concern at the Labour’s conference in September, where delegates voted overwhelmingly to commit the party to seeking a new referendum if it could not force a general election.On Tuesday night, McDonnell said he would vote remain in a new referendum, in contrast with Jeremy Corbyn, who had refused to commit which way he would vote when asked on Sky News last week.“We can’t have no deal on the ballot paper,” McDonnell said. “There’s an overwhelming majority in parliament against that happening, because of the damage.”McDonnell said he had recently met leading figures from the People’s Vote campaign, including Alastair Campbell and Ed Miliband’s former adviser Tom Baldwin.The shadow chancellor said he expected May to lose the first vote, and present a tweaked deal that he predicted would fail as well.“All through that, we will be calling for a general election,” he said. “Whether and when we put a vote of no confidence down will be a tactical decision. We’ll want a maximum effect.”He said the party had been meeting to discuss coordination with the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and Caroline Lucas of the Greens. “If we can’t get a general election, people’s vote is on the table and that might be an option we seize upon,” he said.Before that, the party would also offer their own versions of a deal, he said. “We’ll have to go through that sequence to show we’re doing everything we can,” he said.Corbyn’s team is planning for a range of possible scenarios as the Labour leader prepares to ramp up efforts to explain his alternative plan to the public in the coming days. He is expected to confront the prime minister in a head-to-head television debate.The Labour leadership is determined to reject the idea gaining ground at Westminster of a Norway-plus deal. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said on Tuesday she hoped a majority could coalesce around the proposal, which is being promoted by the Conservative backbencher Nick Boles.However, senior Labour sources insisted they regarded it as an unacceptable abrogation of sovereignty that would fail to honour the referendum result, won by the Vote Leave campaign with the slogan “take back control” – though some shadow cabinet members will be keener to explore it.The party intends to hold out for its own plan, involving a permanent customs union and a close relationship with the single market that falls short of full membership. Despite McDonnell’s warm words, Labour is expected to resist demands for a second referendum unless all other options have been exhausted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82123994551f2a8676d86242d80f6be0a4e7eeca/0_49_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08165bbba14620a16f2444841c8ff31b","title":"nasa mars insight lander sends back first picture from red planet","story":"InSight probe reveals desolate landscape as dust settles after its arrival on Martian surfaceThis is the view across Elysium Planitia, the vast lava plain near the equator of Mars, where Nasa’s InSight lander touched down after a hair-raising descent on Monday.

Forty-eight hours. More than 630 moves. An apparent intelligence leak. A definite black eye. There’s been nothing to separate Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States in their world championship staredown over the last three weeks in London. Every one of their 12 classical games ended in a draw, making it the first title match in which no decisive results were managed in the competition’s official 132-year history.But the historic deadlock will be resolved on Wednesday in a sound-proof studio at the College in London when the world’s top two players compete in a series of quickfire tie-breakers to determine an outright winner in the €1m (£880,000) match.If Carlsen wins, the 27-year-old will seal his third defence of the title that he captured from Viswanathan Anand in 2013. If Caruana prevails, the 26-year-old challenger will become only the second American-born player to capture the world championship after Bobby Fischer in 1972.For many, the protracted impasse has proven a deeply unsatisfying spectacle, prompting broad discussions over whether the match format needs an overhaul. Public dismay reached a climax after Monday’s Game 12 when Carlsen, whose reputation was built on the ruthless punishment of opponents in marathon endgames, appeared content to settle for yet another peaceful result after 31 moves despite clear advantages in time and position.But Carlsen v Caruana – the first title showdown between the world’s No 1 and No 2 players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time – was always pitched as an evenly matched bout between two elite operators brought up in the age of computer chess and by that metric it has surely delivered. The razor-thin margin between the contestants on the scoreboard is an accurate reflection of the three points that separate them in Fide’s Elo ratings.Carlsen will play as white in Wednesday’s first tiebreak stage after the drawing of lots following Monday’s game: a best-of-four rapid match with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. (This is where the Norwegian was able to close the show after he was pushed to tie-breakers against Russia’s Sergey Karjakin two years ago in New York.)If that is not enough to settle matters, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). If all five mini-matches are drawn, it will come down to one sudden-death Armageddon match in which white receives five minutes, black receives four minutes and both will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. If that game is drawn, black will be declared the winner.Carlsen, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top-rated rapid player and top-rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), has a far better record under tighter time controls and is widely regarded as favourite. He’s a perfect nine for nine in tie-breakers going back more than a decade with the added advantage of experience on the sport’s biggest stage.Yet there have been indications Carlsen, having teetered so perilously against Karjakin in 2016, is an even further diminished player in London. His glib response to a reporter who asked if he had a favourite player from history – “Probably myself like three or four years ago,” he quipped – prompted laughter from the press gallery but was thick with confessional subtext and pathos. And no less than Garry Kasparov himself said on Monday that Carlsen’s hasty draw offer in Game 12 betrayed a lapse of spirit.“In light of this shocking draw offer from Magnus in a superior position with more time, I reconsider my evaluation of him being the favourite in rapids,” the longtime world No 1 wrote on Twitter. “Tiebreaks require tremendous nerves and he seems to be losing his.”Whoever prevails in Wednesday’s tiebreakers, it is clear the dialogue over a potential format change for the next world title match in 2020 will not be quietened anytime soon. Yet that’s a conversation for another day. When asked whether their unprecedented parade of draws, even in the package of a fiercely contested match, was bad for the sport, both Carlsen and Caruana bristled at the notion.“We work with the match that we have,” Caruana said. “If the powers that be want to change it, then we’ll work with something else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c37ea66ef0e394466aaabbd1e603d090c4a1740/0_134_3377_2026/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158f7946c8ba2b0c8b50929d9fa36145","title":"former teammates clash over australian crickets non aggression pact","story":"Michael Clarke and Simon Katich famously clashed physically in the dressing room when they were Test players and this week they have become embroiled in a verbal disagreement over Australia’s commitment to be less aggressive on the pitch.Clarke joined a chorus of former players who have criticised the new ethos propagated in the wake of March’s ball tampering scandal, saying Australia’s chances of success would be compromised if their aggressive streak was tempered.“You don’t need to be best mates with everyone. Australian cricket, I think, needs to stop worrying about being liked and start worrying about being respected,” former Australia captain Clarke told Macquarie Sports Radio.Katich, a former Test opener, has been touted as a candidate to join the Cricket Australia board in the wake of a highly critical cultural review that forced the resignation of chairman David Peever.Among the findings of the Longstaff review was that on-field abuse of opponents had been “normalised” and a culture of “winning without counting the cost” had been fostered in the Australian game.Katich thought Clarke had missed the point. “What’s been forgotten in all of this is we blatantly cheated and the reason we’re at this point now, and what led us to this point, and we talk about the line that was talked about for so long,” he told SEN radio.“The point is, we were caught for blatantly cheating and we have to rectify that as soon as possible to earn back the respect of the cricketing public in Australia and worldwide.“We’ve been a disliked team for a number of years through that on-field behaviour and it obviously came to a head in Cape Town. They can still play the Australian way in terms of playing competitive and playing fairly, but not going over the top and going across the rules like they did in Cape Town.”Captain Steve Smith and his vice captain David Warner were banned for a year, while batsman Cameron Bancroft was suspended for nine months by Cricket Australia for the attempts to tamper with the ball in a Test against South Africa in Cape Town.Tim Paine will lead the side into a four-Test home series against India next week, having vowed to eradicate sledging under his captaincy.

A second victory over the All Blacks in three matches was a tactical masterclass, served up by Schmidt and Farrell and carried out by their players with relentless intensity. And all without Conor Murray. They are favourites to defend the Six Nations title and, as both Hansen and Eddie Jones have said recently, they have the ideal domestic set-up for international success.Far too early to say they are in decline, but four defeats in the past 18 months demonstrates they have slipped off their perch. With no matches until next summer the next six months will prove defining for Steve Hansen and his coaching staff. Tweaks rather than wholesale changes are required, but there can be no question that player migration to the northern hemisphere is hurting them. Now may be the time to accept that Beauden Barrett, for all his attacking talents, is a fullback playing out of position and that New Zealand need a fly-half in the mould of Johnny Sexton or Owen Farrell, capable of steering them through tight matches. Kieran Read will benefit from a long rest, for he was part of a back-row that looked sub-par this autumn, all the more so without Sam Cane. They are still the team to beat, but Ireland and South Africa have shown how that can be done.Warren Gatland may have been exaggerating when claiming that four wins from four this November ranks the same as a Six Nations grand slam, but Wales’s progress cannot be ignored any longer. Their three-point victory over Australia was hardly a classic but do not underestimate its significance after 13 successive defeats by the Wallabies. The development of strength in depth continues apace with Gareth Anscombe, in particular, now looking every inch an international fly-half. Such a shame to see Ellis Jenkins suffer a serious injury after shining at openside but if Sam Warburton the flanker is not missed, his leadership may well be come Japan. Alun Wyn Jones is totemic but needs support in that sense. Good to see George North looking dangerous again.Reasons for optimism after three wins from four, even if significant changes in personnel still feel as if they have come a little late. Jones says he wants around 800 caps in his starting XV next year but without recalling Mike Brown, Chris Robshaw and Dan Cole he is not going to get there and selecting any of those would feel like a step back now. Jones seems most pleased with his side’s first-half showing against New Zealand, but arguably the most instructive 40 minutes came in the second half against Australia. Yes, the Wallabies were woeful, but here were England seizing the initiative (they still seem most comfortable when being reactionary) and adopting a power game that will only be boosted by the Vunipola brothers. Having said that, it is a damning indictment that no tier one side is as reliant on one man as England are on Owen Farrell. Should injury strike their captain – he officially shares the title with Dylan Hartley but this is his team – England’s chances of success in Japan go down with him.Four matches this autumn, all decided by less than 10 points, with two wins and two defeats for the Springboks. There is no need for panic at this stage as the curtain comes down on Rassie Erasmus’s first year in charge, despite defeats by England and Wales. Faf de Klerk did not play in either match, for a start, and Erasmus goes into 2019 safe in the knowledge he has established his side as contenders again. There is, of course, next year’s Rugby Championship to get out of the way first, but at present they can look forward to their World Cup opener against New Zealand, having beaten them once and come within a whisker of doing so again over the summer. Not their fault, but it was one of the sour notes of the autumn that De Klerk was in the crowd at Twickenham, not on the pitch, and on the whole it still feels as if there is room for more clarity as to their selection policy.A narrow defeat by South Africa and another loss in Cardiff ensures the optimism in the camp is tempered somewhat, but Scotland have exposed some new players to Test match intensity, chalked up an emphatic win against an albeit unprepared Fiji side, and edged past Argentina. John Barclay was missed in the back-row but what they would not give for a big scalp on the road – they go to Paris and Twickenham – during the Six Nations before heading to Japan. The backline is settled and stylish with Huw Jones growing in influence at outside-centre while Finn Russell remains their No 1 fly-half despite Adam Hastings’ emergence. Their World Cup match against Japan – the last match in Pool A – is shaping up to be decisive.This was Australia’s worst year since 1958, with nine defeats and only four wins, yet the nagging feeling remains that they have the talent and competitive nature to contend in Japan. If there was one moment of the autumn that exposed one of their long-term problems it was Farrell’s no-arms tackle on Izack Rodda. Farrell is one of the toughest tackling fly-halves around, but it is hard to imagine he would have been anything more than a speed bump if it were Nathan Sharpe or John Eales running at him, and the Wallabies have been crying out for a grizzled, granite lock or two for years. Will Skelton, currently at Saracens, would be welcomed back into the fold if rules on eligibility were relaxed and by the same token Sean McMahon, currently in Japan, would walk back into the squad. Michael Cheika moved heaven and earth to get the squad he wanted in 2015 and he should do so again next year.Another couple of steps back for France this autumn, and it is surely wishful thinking that they will get their act together in time to mount a serious challenge in Japan. Losing at home to Fiji, having drawn with Japan last autumn, is the sort of result that would have perhaps cost Jacques Brunel his job if the World Cup were not so close. Among the few positives, there at least seems to be a spine to their team in the shape of Louis Picamoles, Baptiste Serin and Camille Lopez, and while Gaël Fickou did not start against South Africa, surely he must do so from here on in. Still, the tactic of throwing the ball around inside their own 22 against Fiji demonstrates the lack of leadership within the side, and Sekou Macalou’s omission continues to baffle.Provided the moment of the month when the whole squad gathered arm in arm to sing the gospel hymn We Have Overcome after a first ever win against France. That victory was another stark reminder of what the Pacific Island nations are capable of with time to prepare. Ben Ryan, who masterminded Fiji’s Olympic sevens gold medal in 2016, pointed out after the win that the squad will not assemble again for more than six months, demonstrating the hurdles they keep having to overcome. But they will have more time together in the lead-up to the World Cup and as a result Wales, and particularly Australia, will be looking over their shoulders in Pool D.They never seem to fare well in the autumn, and while they were competitive, defeats by Ireland, France and Scotland are hardly anything to write home about and come after somehow throwing away a 31-7 lead against Australia. There have been improvements under Mario Ledesma certainly, and they have a habit of picking up in World Cup years, but while they can end their year on a high against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday, they remain outsiders behind England and France to get out of their World Cup pool.If only everyone played like Japan. To see them give England an almighty scare, then a couple of hours later to watch Ireland’s victory over the All Blacks, was almost like watching two different sports and you can only marvel at Japan’s skill levels when moving the ball at pace. Equally, you can only sit back and applaud their captain Michael Leitch and his inspirational qualities. In terms of results it has not been a great autumn, though – losing to a World XV, getting hammered by a second-string New Zealand, running out of steam against England and just squeezing past Russia last weekend. They have shown enough, though, to believe they can emerge from their World Cup pool – and they will certainly not die wondering.They may have been denied a 10th straight win and an unbeaten 2018 by Ireland, but the USA are still going places under Gary Gold as their dramatic win over Samoa in San Sebastián attests. Will cause England, France and Argentina discomfort in Japan.Blitzed by New Zealand and Ireland and comfortably beaten by a poor Australia side this autumn, but at least they overcame Georgia in a match where defeat would have been unthinkable for Conor O’Shea’s side. Hard to see anything but five defeats in the Six Nations.A mixed bag, following defeat by Italy with morale-boosting wins over Tonga and Samoa. They are in with Australia, Wales and Fiji next year so finishing third in their pool again is a tough ask, even if none of that trio will relish playing them.Their 50-point defeat against Wales was a case study in the difficulties facing tier two nations at present. They were level after 45 minutes but conceded an unanswered half-century thereafter in only their third match against tier one opposition in three years.Canada booked the final spot in next year’s World Cup with victories over Kenya, Germany and Hong Kong in the repechage, taking their place in Pool B alongside New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia. Elsewhere, these are troubled times for Samoa, who suffered defeats by the USA and Georgia before overcoming Spain.

Now it’s a light but powerful operating system, with Android and Linux app support.The Pixel Slate is Google’s attempt to show that Chrome OS can pull double duty as both an entertainment tablet operating system and a serious desktop-class workhorse.On the outside the Pixel Slate is about as simple as tablets get. The front is filled with a crisp and beautiful 12.3in high-density LCD screen that’s as good as you’d find on top-end laptops.A relatively wide and uniform bezel frames the screen and houses a webcam in the top and a pair of fairly powerful stereo speakers in the left and right sides. The screen’s Gorilla Glass 5 rounds off into an aluminium body, which feels comfortable to hold for extended periods.Flip the tablet over to find the dark blue aluminium back is oddly featureless, marked only by a subtle “G” logo in top left corner and a camera in the top right.The bottom of the tablet has a magnetic connector for slotting into the keyboard case, while the power button in the top left doubles as fingerprint scanner and works well.The Pixel Slate is 7mm thick, which is 1.5mm thinner than Microsoft’s Surface Pro 6, but 1.1mm thicker than the new 12.9in Apple iPad Pro. The Google tablet weighs 726g, which is 50g lighter than the Surface Pro 6, but almost 100g heavier than the iPad Pro. The Pixel Slate is thin and light for a PC, but bigger and heavier than most media tablets.The model tested had a 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 (8200Y) processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.The point of Chrome OS is that it provides a good experience on cheap, low-end hardware. Give it relatively powerful components and it absolutely flies.The Core i5 version tested handled everything you can do with Chrome OS with aplomb. No amount of Chrome tabs brought it to a crawl. Heavy duty web apps, such as content management systems and other tools, flew. You can run as many extensions as you like with Chrome with no noticeable performance impact.All the Android apps ran as fast as they would on a modern smartphone too, including games such as Shadowgun Legends, although the tablet reached around 50C at its peak and felt pretty hot to touch.Battery life was excellent for a work tablet, lasting close to 10 hours between charges when used like a laptop, with 10 or so Chrome tabs open alongside various chat, imaging and media apps.Opening up the machine at 9am, the Pixel Slate would last all the way through the heaviest of work days and still have enough charge for a movie on the way home.It’ll charge via either of the USB-C ports in the left and right sides, and took about two and a half hours to fully charge from flat while being used.On the face of it, the predominantly mouse and keyboard-driven Chrome OS appears an odd choice for a tablet, but over the past few years Google has pushed Android app integration and made lots of touch-centric tweaks.Chrome OS on the Pixel Slate has two modes: a desktop experience enabled when you attach a keyboard and mouse, and a Android-like tablet mode when used on its own.As a desktop the Pixel Slate behaves like any modern Chrome OS device. A shelf at the bottom of the screen shows your pinned and running app icons, there’s a start-menu-like “launcher” button in the bottom left and a system tray in the right with an Android-like notification shade. Apps open as windows, and can be arranged however you like.Press the launcher button and up pops a search box and some AI-powered app suggestions for what you might need at that moment. Swipe up or press the up arrow to see all your apps, or just start typing to find an app, file or to search the web. It’s a familiar experience for anyone who has used Windows 10 or MacOS.Grab the tablet on its own and the interface switches to look like Android with the launcher becoming the homescreen filled with apps and folders. A back button appears in the bottom left and the overview button in the bottom right.Tap an app from the homescreen and it launches in full-screen. The dock stays at the bottom of the screen with pinned and currently running apps. Hit the overview button to zoom out and see running apps in a screen that looks like the multitasking view from MacOS or Android, which is where you can jump into another app or run two side-by-side in splitscreen.Scrolling with your finger is super smooth, as are the animations, while bigger tap targets and familiar swiping gestures make it feel much more a mobile tablet. But this is still full Chrome, not a cut-down mobile version, giving you the best, most powerful browsing experience on any platform. It’s a joy to use.Android apps are a bit more of a mixed bag. Most run as they do on a real Android tablet but some have quirks, such as Citymapper and Wire refusing to run in landscape.Netflix works fine, but even it has oddities such as failing to recognise an ethernet connection as akin to wifi, meaning you have to uncheck “download only on wifi” to store shows offline.Sky’s Q app also crashes while streaming TV, sending you back to the media select screen periodically. As far as Android app support on Chrome OS has come, it’s still a work in progress.The Pixel Slate keyboard has one of the best typing experiences I have used, with backlit keys, solid travel, good feel and spacing. The only thing missing are delete and track skip media buttons, but these are minor quibbles. The large, smooth and responsive trackpad is good too.The keyboard attaches to the bottom and back of the Slate via reassuringly strong magnets, holding it at a relatively large range of viewing angles – far better than most other folding folio-style tablet stands.Unfortunately when closed the keyboard side slides around against the screen, which might end up scratching the display and feels less than reassuring when carried.The Pixelbook Pen is the same stylus that launched with the Pixelbook last year, with Google Assistant features and a solid on-screen writing experience with low lag, tilt and pressure sensitivity.It’s a bit thick and unbalanced for my liking, but is useful for signing documents or making quick sketches. I don’t think it’s a must-buy with the Pixel Slate, but then I’m not trying to use it for illustration or design.Annoyingly there’s nowhere to reliably attach it to the tablet or the folio keyboard, so the potential for losing it is high.The Google Pixel Slate comes in various processor and memory configurations starting at £549 with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage or £649 for 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.Variants with eighth-generation Intel processors start at £749 with a Core m3, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, £969 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and topping out at £1,549 for a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.The Pixel Slate Keyboard costs £189 and the Pixelbook Pen £99.The Pixel Slate makes a very convincing argument for the death of Android tablets. Turning the desktop-class experience of Chrome OS into a mobile, finger-friendly operating system brings the best of both worlds together in one neat package. At least in theory. Most of it works really, really well. But it is a case of trial and error for Android apps to see what works and what doesn’t.If you need to get stuff done, and you primarily do so in a browser with additional little bits of software such as Evernote, chat apps or the like, the Pixel Slate is a productivity powerhouse when in laptop mode. The Keyboard folio is therefore an essential purchase adding £189 to the cost of the machine.But I was pleasantly surprised by how good the tablet experience was on the Pixel Slate. There are quirks, a few apps need a bit of work, and a few things are missing from the standard Android experience, but having a thoroughly touch-adapted desktop-class Chrome at your fingertips is wonderful. The Pixel Slate offers the best, most powerful browsing experience of any device.Chrome OS is still a work in progress and there will be the occasional thing you’ll still need a full Windows PC to do, but what the Pixel Slate offers already is worth buying if you want to be on the bleeding edge. Just don’t expect every app and game to offer the most polished experience despite the premium price.Pros: long battery life, the best browsing experience, great screen, good keyboards, frequent software updates, USB-CCons: some apps behave weirdly, Chrome OS still can’t do everything a Windows PC can, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Now, the director has turned his wild imagination to TV in bittersweet comedy KiddingMichel Gondry accepts that life is a struggle. His films – Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep and Mood Indigo, with Audrey Tautou – have a child’s sense of wonder and the soul of a neurotic, their papier-mache stop-motion reveries never quite patching over the holes in his characters’ hearts.On an ordinary morning in Los Angeles, where the 55-year-old French film-maker recently finished work on the dark comedy series Kidding, which starts on Sky Atlantic on 29 November, Gondry just wants a simple coffee and croissant. But his sugar packet won’t open and neither will the strawberry jam. After much ripping and stabbing, his side of the table is coated in sticky crystals and his butter knife looks like a murder weapon. Gondry waves away the chaos. His sticky, human fingerprints are on everything he touches – why not his breakfast, too?Perhaps because of Gondry’s penchant for making wild animations out of everyday materials such as cardboard and felt, even the decision to order an inferior frozen croissant over the local avocado toast seems to imply a quirky defiance: he’ll survive in Hollywood on his own terms. “My home would be Paris, but if I go there I will be depressed,” says Gondry. “Here, when I want to do something, it is very easy to make things move. In Paris, it is much heavier. I like to do my ideas right away.”Gondry is happiest when his hands are busy, whether animating construction paper for the opening credits of Kidding, or crafting silent short films for his three-year-old daughter. For her birthday, he rented a screening room and a jazz musician and read the subtitles aloud while she sat on his lap. Other projects force him to hold his tongue, including a music video he made with Beyoncé, which was shelved. “I’m not supposed to talk about her,” he sighs. “I signed a nondisclosure – but I don’t care.”When Gondry first moved to the US to direct music videos in the 1990s for the likes of Björk, the White Stripes and Beck, he barely spoke English. Bands would hand him their lyrics, and he’d understand only one word in 10. So he filled in the gaps with his imagination, creating a string of inimitable fever dreams that somehow captured the song perfectly – such as the dancers in skeleton suits wiggling up and down stairs to Daft Punk’s Around the World.From there, Gondry springboarded into movies. His first feature, Human Nature, starred Patricia Arquette as a hair-covered nudist seeking a mate, and flopped. Gondry poured his frustrations into a diary. On the left side of the book, he would write down a problem with the film, such as the one identified by a reviewer, who said it didn’t breathe. “The critiques that hurt are generally the ones that are true,” he admits. Then on the right-hand side, he wrote his proposed solution. Gondry reread the journal every day while making his second film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. That film reoriented his career, proving that the MTV wunderkind could grapple with adult emotions of love and loss. Over the past decade and a half, its reputation has grown from being a cult marvel to one of the landmark masterpieces of the new millennium.“Eternal Sunshine started quite small and grew and grew,” he says. Jim Carrey’s role as a depressive ex-boyfriend established that the blockbuster comedian was also capable of romantic tragedy. Now Carrey is the star of Kidding, Gondry’s first TV show (apart from a single episode of Flight of the Conchords). It is an impish, howling, heartbroken comedy-drama. Carrey plays Jeff, a superstar kids’ TV host known as Mr Pickles, who is smiling his way to a mental breakdown.On screen, Mr Pickles and his puppet friend Uke-Larry sing songs about friendship in the service of a $100m family business that also employs his father and sister. “Isn’t growing up funny and sweet?” he coos. Not really. Off screen, Jeff’s teenage son is dead, and he is suffocating from the pressure to soothe the public. He has worn his Mr Pickles mask for so long that no one, not even him, knows how to rip it off. His ex-wife complains, correctly, that his stubborn cheer forced her to mourn their boy alone.“Kids know the sky is blue. They need to know what to do when it’s falling,” Jeff insists to his dad, the show’s CEO, asking to grapple with his tragedy on air. But Jeff’s father vetoes his honesty. “Jeff needs to heal,” he counters. “Mr Pickles is fine.”Gondry is more sympathetic to Mr Pickles’ plight. He agrees that children shouldn’t be shielded from calamity. “Since I was six, I panicked about infinity, the sun, the stars, all that,” he says. “I thought if you were dead, you had reached the end of time.” As well as being plagued by existential terror, Gondry has an innocent side, too. Show creator Dave Holstein scripted a running joke about how Jeff is too naive to understand what the “p” stands for (“pussy”) in the phrase “p-hound”, which a lothario crew member (played by Danny Trejo) has bronzed on a necklace. Gondry didn’t get the gag either. “It took me a while to understand that joke,” he says with a groan. “I was ashamed, too shy to ask some questions. It could make me look stupid to ask that.”It’s 14 years since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind brought Gondry and Carrey together. Carrey says: “He, for me, was the linchpin. I was incredibly interested in the material, but when Michel came on board, I thought, ‘I get to go play with a teammate, and that’s really wonderful.’ It was a thrill.”“We wanted to work together again,” Gondry says, “but we had never found the right script.” Instead, he dabbled in a comic-book film, 2011’s The Green Hornet starring Seth Rogen, which put a handcrafted spin on a factory-stamped product. Audiences weren’t sure what to make of the result, and Gondry didn’t fight to make a sequel. It wasn’t that he felt awkward about selling out. “I think it’s happy to be popular,” he says. “I would rather be the potato than the cabbage.” Yet he was wary of the hold huge franchises have on the cultural imagination. “I don’t believe in superheroes,” he says. “I think it’s a worse way of being a nerd. I’ve been to Comic-Con two times, and all those kids dressed as Spider-Man and Batman, I feel bad for them, because they should dress in their own character.”Meanwhile, Carrey has spent years scaling back his acting to unearth his deeper creative inspirations, which have given rise to vivid, grotesque paintings of Donald Trump, almost as if he and Gondry were destined to reconnect over their shared passion for arts and crafts. “He said there is nothing that makes him happier than to wake up in the morning, take his notebook, his drawing pad, his Sharpies or markers, and draw. I totally understand that,” says Gondry. “We talk about art at this level, not art with a big A.”Carrey, he says, is a Hollywood titan who’s prepared to get vulnerable. “You look at what they call the A-list and you have all these actors who carry this obligation of being cool. It’s hard for me to identify with them because they are a sort of elite,” he adds. “Jim and I have both aged. He is a bit more damaged. When he started, he had a rubber face. He could imitate people, contract his muscles, just amazing. But as you get older, the skin gets a little more dry, so when he moves you see what’s underneath. He doesn’t really like to see himself like that, but I see little glimpses of sadness, loneliness, and I bring them out.”He certainly has a different idea of what an avuncular hero looks like. “The nicest American is Noam Chomsky,” pronounces Gondry. He got to know the activitst and philosopher while making the experimental documentary Is the Man Who Is Tall Happy?, in which Gondry bombarded Chomsky with questions about the definition of a tree and the existence of pure truth, and Chomsky’s answers are animated in marker pen. He still tugs on Chomsky’s sleeve over email. “We talk about Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. They mixed apparently in the south of Italy. There are people who have traces of Neanderthal!”As Gondry heads back home to play with construction paper, perhaps the waiters cleaning up his breakfast wreckage might wonder if he, too, is fully evolved. Absolutely not – which is why audiences adore him.• Kidding begins on Sky Atlantic on 29 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4544d2b3d40e69093e3c4f267fddaa70f59145a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2882f12a6845ae05ce56cb415d51030","title":"cindy hyde smith wins mississippi senate seat in special election","story":"The runoff race drew national attention after comments from the Republican candidate stirred up the state’s complicated racial historyRepublican Cindy Hyde-Smith won Mississippi’s special election runoff for the US Senate late Tuesday, pledging in her victory speech to represent everyone in the state.“The reason we won is because Mississippi knows me, and knows my heart”, said Hyde-Smith just before 10pm in a Jackson, Mississippi hotel ballroom.“I want everyone to know, no matter who you voted for today, I’m going to always represent every Mississippian.”The runoff drew national attention after Hyde-Smith made a series of racially loaded remarks, most notoriously when she said of a supporter “if he invited me to a public hanging, I would be on the front row.”The statement provoked controversy in a state that had more lynchings than any other in the country, considering she ran against an African American opponent. Hyde-Smith was initially defensive about the comments and eventually offered an apology to “anyone that was offended” at the only debate of the runoff.However, she immediately insisted that “this comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me”. The furor sparked by the comment led to a number of corporate donors to demand refunds of campaign donations to the appointed incumbent.In her speech Hyde-Smith also said she had just spoken with president Donald Trump, and thanked him for his help in securing the victory. Trump held two rallies for her in Mississippi on Monday.It was a short speech to a crowd of about 100, with Hyde-Smith taking leave early for an early morning trip to back to Washington DC. Supporters stuck around to chat and shake hands with state Republican officials who mingled in the crowd.Hyde-Smith was appointed to the seat earlier this year after longtime incumbent Thad Cochran resigned due to ill health. A two-term state agriculture commissioner, the Republican was viewed as the best bet to head off a primary challenger from conservative firebrand Chris McDaniel, a state senator who had almost knocked off Cochran in 2014. McDaniel’s narrow loss in a primary runoff, after he had received the most votes in the initial round of voting, fueled conservative anger at the Republican establishment and became a rightwing cause célèbre for years afterwards.Espy was hoping that the controversy around Hyde-Smith’s remarks would lead to a replay of the Alabama special election in 2017 where Democrat Doug Jones won a narrow victory against Roy Moore by wooing Republicans appalled by their party’s nominee with moderate rhetoric. However, Hyde-Smith’s comments did not have the same electoral impact as the allegations of sexual assault against Moore did in Alabama.Espy also faced his own controversial history. He was handed a 30-count indictment for taking improper gifts as Secretary of Agriculture under President Bill Clinton. Although the former congressman was acquitted, Hyde-Smith hammered Espy on that as well as his lobbying work for the government of the Ivory Coast.Partisan elections in Mississippi ide sharply along racial lines, and forecasters had concluded that to win Tuesday’s election, Espy would have needed to secure record turnout among black voters. Numbers were up compared with recent runoff elections, but not enough to turn the tide.That’s not for a lack of effort on the part volunteers who were out trying to turn out the vote through the final hours that polls remained open. For many, Hyde Smith’s remarks had become an extra motivating factor in a contest so steeped in racial overtones.“It was a reality check for those of us who think we’re past some of this racism because we’re not,” said Allytra Perryman a community organizer with the Black Voters Matter Fund, adding that the recent comments by and revelations had “built a lot of energy in African-American community.”In the southern Mississippi town of D’Iberville, sitting in the passenger seat of a silver pickup truck outfitted with Espy campaign billboards, Perryman asked resident after resident if they had voted through a microphone. Most nodded or gave a thumbs up, until one seemed to ignore her. She told the driver to slow up. “No no no, they’re going to have to tell me no to my face,” she said.Nearby, outside a polling place in Moss Point, Jennifer Garraway waved and smiled at incoming voters holding a campaign sign for Espy and for a local judge candidate for much of the day Tuesday. And when she knew the folks driving in - which was often- she encouraged them to roll down their windows for a chat.She was pleased by the turnout she saw from her post on the side of the road. “You can’t expect to come out on the winning side if you don’t show up - and we showed up. That’s what’s important. You can’t sit on the sidelines and not be a part of this. People have died and put in blood for this,” Garraway said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8898959573f6b9856a2d7f1764081e37b534e7/0_187_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff9a147d8c675f7416fedaf11d3730ce","title":"manafort held secret talks with assange in ecuadorian embassy","story":"Trump ally met WikiLeaks founder months before emails hacked by Russia were publishedDonald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the  has been told.Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House.In a statement, Manafort denied meeting Assange. He said: “I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him. I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter.”It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.A well-placed source has told the  that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016. Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met. Assange described the story as a hoax.Manafort was jailed this year and was thought to have become a star cooperator in the Mueller inquiry. But on Monday Mueller said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the FBI, despite agreeing to cooperate two months ago in a plea deal. According to a court document, Manafort had committed “crimes and lies” on a “variety of subject matters”.His defence team says he believes what he has told Mueller to be truthful and has not violated his deal.Manafort’s first visit to the embassy took place a year after Assange sought asylum inside, two sources said.According to the sources, Manafort returned to the embassy in 2015. He paid another visit in spring 2016, turning up alone, around the time Trump named him as his convention manager. The visit is tentatively dated to March.Manafort’s 2016 visit to Assange lasted about 40 minutes, one source said, adding that the American was casually dressed when he exited the embassy, wearing sandy-coloured chinos, a cardigan and a light-coloured shirt.Visitors normally register with embassy security guards and show their passports. Sources in Ecuador, however, say Manafort was not logged.Embassy staff were aware only later of the potential significance of Manafort’s visit and his political role with Trump, it is understood.The revelation could shed new light on the sequence of events in the run-up to summer 2016, when WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of emails hacked by the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. Hillary Clinton has said the hack contributed to her defeat.The previously unreported Manafort-Assange connection is likely to be of interest to Mueller, who has been investigating possible contacts between WikiLeaks and associates of Trump including the political lobbyist Roger Stone and Donald Trump Jr.One key question is when the Trump campaign was aware of the Kremlin’s hacking operation – and what, if anything, it did to encourage it. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion.Earlier this year Mueller indicted 12 GRU intelligence officers for carrying out the hack, which began in March 2016.In June of that year WikiLeaks emailed the GRU via an intermediary seeking the DNC material. After failed attempts, Vladimir Putin’s spies sent the documents in mid-July to WikiLeaks as an encrypted attachment.According to sources, Manafort’s acquaintance with Assange goes back at least five years, to late 2012 or 2013, when the American was working in Ukraine and advising its Moscow-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych. Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear. During this period the veteran consultant was involved in black operations against Yanukovych’s chief political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, whom Yanukovych had jailed. Manafort ran an extensive lobbying operation featuring European former politicians.He flew frequently from the US to Ukraine’s capital, Kiev – usually via Frankfurt but sometimes through London, flight records seen by the  show.Manafort is currently in jail in Alexandria, Virginia. In August a jury convicted him of crimes arising from his decade-long activities in Ukraine. They include large-scale money laundering and failure to pay US tax. Manafort pleaded guilty to further charges in order to avoid a second trial in Washington.As well as accusing him of lying on Monday, the special counsel moved to set a date for Manafort to be sentenced.﻿One person familiar with WikiLeaks said Assange was motivated to damage the Democrats campaign because he believed a future Trump administration would be less likely to seek his extradition on possible charges of espionage. This fate had hung over Assange since 2010, when he released confidential US state department cables. It contributed to his decision to take refuge in the embassy.According to the dossier written by the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, Manafort was at the centre of a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” between the Trump campaign and Russia’s leadership. The two sides had a mutual interest in defeating Clinton, Steele wrote, whom Putin “hated and feared”.As a candidate Trump warmly welcomed the dump of DNC emails by Assange. In October 2016 he declared: “I love WikiLeaks.” Trump’s comments came after WikiLeaks released a second tranche of emails seized from the email account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman.The Trump White House subsequently sent out mixed messages over Assange and his legal fate. In 2017 and behind the scenes Assange tried to reach a deal with Trump’s Department of Justice that might see him avoid US prison.In May 2017, , Manafort flew to Ecuador to hold talks with the country’s president-elect Lenín Moreno. The discussions, days before Moreno was sworn in, and before Manafort was indicted – were ostensibly about a large-scale Chinese investment.However, one source in Quito suggests that Manafort also discreetly raised Assange’s plight. Another senior foreign ministry source said he was sceptical Assange was mentioned. At the time Moreno was expected to continue support for him.Last week a court filing released in error suggested that the US justice department had secretly charged Assange with a criminal offence. Written by the assistant US attorney, Kellen Dwyer, the document did not say what Assange had been charged with or when the alleged offence took place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/979f6d2dde537a22b54ed1b989ac55e97123e4f4/0_251_3585_2151/master/3585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc66f44eb3db9700810a9a97a8134afc","title":"a humiliation outcry after mexico president gives highest honour to jared kushner","story":"Enrique Peña Nieto to hand Trump son-in-law the Order of the Aztec Eagle for trade workOutgoing Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has stunned the country by bestowing the nation’s highest honour for foreigners on Jared Kushner, senior White House advisor and son-in-law of Donald Trump.Peña Nieto praised Kushner as “a grand ally of Mexico” who helped achieve a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.The revised agreement – now known as Usmca – is expected to be signed in Buenos Aires during the G20 summit. Peña Nieto will decorate Kushner with the Order of the Aztec Eagle in the Argentinian capital this week.Peña Nieto was quoted by Mexican media as saying: “He has been an important actor in this objective of having a good understanding of the new government that entered two years ago.” Trump repeatedly disparaged Mexicans during his improbable rise to power. He still threatens to close the US-Mexico border over a caravan of Central American migrants in the city of Tijuana.Mexicans on Tuesday voiced their outrage over Kushner receiving the Order of the Aztec Eagle, whose past recipients include Queen Elizabeth, Nelson Mandela and Walt Disney.Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics, said: “This is the perfect ending for Peña Nieto’s term: an insuperable illustration of the indignity of his government’s position regarding Trump.“It’s the final kick in the crutch for Mexicans.”In August 2016, the then finance minister Luis Videgaray – now foreign minister – convinced Peña Nieto to invite then candidate Trump to Mexico City for a meeting at the presidential palace. In a joint media appearance afterward, Trump again pledged to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico.Peña Nieto appeared acquiescent as he stayed silent – at least until Trump left the country.

Another large protest has been scheduled to coincide with the start of the summit on Friday, although its location has not been announced.Adding to the security stress is the question mark looming over the summit is the scheduled attendance of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has overseen a disastrous war in Yemen – and who western intelligence agencies including the CIA have concluded ordered the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Prosecutors are considering a writ presented on Monday by Human Rights Watch, arguing that the Argentinian courts should invoke a universal jurisdiction statute to seek prosecution of the Prince Mohammed for war crimes and torture.Although the writ is likely to be rejected by the court, Prince Mohammed’s presence will pose a dilemma for world leaders on whether to participate in meetings with him.Donald Trump, who has dismissed the reported findings of his own intelligence agencies, has said he is prepared to meet the prince, despite growing opposition in Congress to US military support for Saudi Arabia.The US president will arrive in the largest air fleet bringing attendees to the summit: 10 aircraft – also carrying land vehicles and armed helicopters – will ferry the US delegation to Buenos Aires.Advanced US security teams have already been in Buenos Aires for 12 days, and Washington will also assist Argentina’s security forces with “low-level radar coverage, extended air surveillance and detection coverage, persistent early warning capability”, according to a US diplomatic note obtained by the .During the summit, a US navy vessel, three E-3 AWACS surveillance aircraft and three KC-135 refueling aircraft will be involved in monitoring Buenos Aires, while the US department of homeland security will also provide a mobile emergency response centre and “cyber intelligence support”, according to the note.The Saudi delegation will arrive in six planes representatives of most of the other G20 countries – including the UK – will arrive on single planes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28f4637b9dc36c5eb7408586f51c95c98c3409d/0_120_2129_1278/master/2129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e16fdbdeaafb502949bea5423b3592e","title":"knickers the cow why australias giant steer is so fascinating","story":"Seven-year-old whose size saved him from the slaughterhouse goes viralFirst, the news, such as it is: there is a giant cow named Knickers in Western Australia and people have gone crazy.Technically he is not a cow, but a steer (a neutered male). But he is giant, standing at 1.94 metres (6ft 4in ) to his withers (the shoulder). This is just shy of the world record-holding steer, Bellino, who lives in Italy and stands at 2.02 metres. Knickers, a Holstein Friesian, weighs in at 1,400kg (220 stone) and is believed to be the biggest steer in Australia.And, for some reason, Knickers and his sizeable existence are the talk of the internet, making news all over the world.“It’s out of control,” says Geoff Pearson, Knickers’ owner, over the phone from his property in Myalup, south of Perth. “I didn’t expect it to go as far as it has. I’ve been called every 10 minutes since four o’clock this morning.”It is, perhaps, no surprise that a country obsessed with building giant things to line its highways – the Big Watermelon has just joined the Big Banana, the Big Prawn and the Big Potato – would be fascinated by an oversized animal.But it is not only Australians who have taken to Knickers. Pearson says he has spent the day fielding calls from the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand, and the story has been picked up by the BBC, CNN, USA Today and the British newspaper the Daily Mirror.The US model and social media genius Chrissy Teigen tweeted to say that she pays for wifi on flights precisely so she doesn’t miss out on news like this.But why exactly are we fascinated by a large steer?Pearson believes it’s just a matter of novelty. “I suppose it’s just a different topic,” he says. “It doesn’t happen every day, you don’t get a steer of that size in normal production systems, and people like animal stories.”This – the baffling reality of Knickers’ unreal size – is certainly part of it, raising questions: was he bred to be this size? Pumped full of hormones? Does this mark a dawning era of bovine megafauna? How did Knickers get so large?“We don’t know that ourselves,” Pearson says. “It’s just a freaky thing.”Partly it’s because Knickers was given the chance to grow to his full height. Steers are usually sold to processing plants at the age of two or three years.“They probably don’t have the opportunity to grow to their full potential,” Pearson says. “There could be other animals that could grow to this size but didn’t get the chance.”But Pearson is adamant that Knickers, who is seven, is a “standout”. “You could go through thousands and thousands of animals and try to find one of this size and you wouldn’t be able to.”Plus, Knickers’ story is one of hope and reprieve. Pearson tried to offload him last month, only to be told by the meat processors said the steer was just too large for the abattoir.“He’s too big for the chain, he’s out of spec, he’d be too heavy for the machines and he’d probably actually be hanging on the floor, so there would be contamination issues, and his cuts of meat would be too large,” Pearson says.Which means Knickers can live out his days on the 3,000-acre property, home to 4,000 head of cattle, for whom he acts as a “coach” – showing them where to roam.“He just hangs around, he’s part of the furniture,” Pearson says. “Obviously he’s gained some stardom – that’s changed his identity a little bit.“We’ll have to see what happens with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4ef25fd2459119308c1041880fb4e37bd7a5fe/578_545_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c3bb9f35ffd4785d5e389517112adb4","title":"people of african descent face dire picture of racism in eu","story":"Almost a third of people of African descent have experienced racial harassment in past five years, survey findsAlmost a third of people of African descent polled in a new EU survey say they have experienced racial harassment in the last five years, a report that claims racial discrimination is “commonplace” across 12 European countries reveals.People of African descent face “a dire picture” of discrimination in housing, the workplace and everyday life, the survey of 5,803 people by the European Union’s fundamental rights agency states.“The survey paints a dire picture of the reality on the ground,” said the agency’s director, Michael O’Flaherty, in a preface to the report. Referring to the EU’s 2000 racial equality directive, he said: “Almost 20 years after adoption of EU laws forbidding discrimination, people of African descent face widespread and entrenched prejudice and exclusion.”O’Flaherty wrote that: “Racial discrimination and harassment are commonplace,” adding that discriminatory profiling by the police is “a common reality”.Most people who took the survey were first and second-generation immigrants, who come from, or have at least one parent from a sub-Saharan African country. The study also includes people from British and French overseas territories, including the Caribbean.It does not, however, include black Europeans whose families have been settled in Europe for three or more generations, because most EU countries do not collect such data – a gap the agency is urging governments to remedy.“We do not claim that we represent the experience of all black people in the European Union,” said Rossalina Latcheva, one of the report’s authors. The agency was convinced, she said, that “these results are indicative for experiences of different people of African descent also from third or fourth generation, fifth generation”.The report will be launched in the European parliament on Wednesday at an event hosted by the Italian politician Cécile Kyenge, one of only three black MEPs in the 751-strong assembly. The MEP has argued that the EU has a gap in its equality strategy and has drafted a non-binding resolution to promote equality for an estimated 15 million people of African descent in the EU. Her text will be voted on next week.In the labour market, people of African descent with a degree were almost twice as likely to work in low-skill occupations than the general population.The agency said one “particularly unsettling finding” was that younger people tended to report worse discrimination than older respondents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab803fb2e6205a6c69d2970215bb8f121129ddd9/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97fd6ff264e8b2eca36e54a80f647b93","title":"the conservation conversation why we need to talk about trees","story":"With tree planting rates in the UK the lowest they have been in 40 years, and more trees being cut down than planted, action is needed to balance the losses. Can a pledge to plant a million trees in five years save our forests? By  Amy-Jane BeerIt’s easy to view trees as scenery. They don’t move about, their longevity gives them an air of permanence, and they support complex biological communities. They are habitat, but they are also inhabitants – fellow Earthlings, whose ability to sense and respond to the world around them we are only just beginning to understand.Despite government targets to increase tree cover, rates of tree planting in the UK are declining, with efforts in 2016 the lowest for 40 years, and failing to match the number of trees felled.The type of species planted is important in ecological and human terms. Native species offer far greater value for wildlife, but other factors to consider are the expected size of full-grown trees, the kind of management that might be required and what uses the tree might serve: for example, shading city streets, forming hedges or producing crops.The best time to plant a tree is autumn or winter, so that the saplings have a good chance to establish a decent root system before the next growth season. This greatly improves their survival chances.When choosing trees to plant, it’s best to avoid imported stock, and if you must plant non-native species, buy locally grown saplings from a reputable nursery. Catastrophes such as the arrival and spread of Chalara (the cause of ash dieback disease) might have been prevented by better attention to imports.Tree planting doesn’t have to mean forest creation. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in street trees, wood pastures and community orchards. Fruit trees have a lot going for them – not only do they provide an obvious return on investment, but they also develop so-called veteran features, such as rot holes, much earlier than native hardwoods. Dead wood is a crucial habitat for a huge array of other species, from fungi to hole-nesting birds and from the myriad invertebrates that use decaying trunks and fallen logs as nurseries to the badgers and hedgehogs that eat them.Planting trees is only half the story, and conserving the trees we already have has never been more important. Replacing a mature tree takes decades, yet the trees being lost are often old ones. At a community level, the loss of such trees can be deeply felt. Effective schemes to increase the visibility of established trees before they face a threat include adopting them, mapping them, and submitting them as candidates in tree of the year competitions. It all helps, and getting to know an inidual tree in all its seasonal moods has a power of its own. Try it – you might discover your oldest and most mysterious friend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3713074.1543398701!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government not out of the woods on broadband issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report found the broadband tender process was not compromised by a series of private meetings attended by Denis Naughten (above).

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer minister for communications Denis Naughten advised the sole remaining bidder for the contract to supply high-speed broadband to remote rural areas that it was asking for too much money for the project last June.Mr Naughten’s warning to Granahan McCourt, the sole bidder for the Government contract, is revealed in the report on the tender process published on Tuesday.The report was requested by the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, after the resignation of Mr Naughten last month. The former minister was forced to resign after it was revealed he had several private meetings with David McCourt, the US businessman who leads the remaining bidder.The report says that while the private meetings gave “cause for concern”, it found the integrity of the process itself has not been undermined by them. The Government on Tuesday said the process would continue, with the new Minister for Communications, Richard Bruton, saying he hoped the Government would be in a position to award the contract or not in the coming weeks.While the report found that Mr Naughten did not influence the process in Mr McCourt’s favour, it is clear that he was involved in discussions with the bidder on the costs of the project.It reveals that Mr Naughten attended a meeting last June in which he made clear to the bidder that the price they were seeking was too high for the State.“The former minister was in attendance to emphasise that he could not bring the potential subsidy likely to be sought on foot of the bidder’s proposal to Government for approval,” the report says.Mr Naughten’s private contacts with Mr McCourt continued after that time, including a dinner in New York and a telephone call in August after a further meeting between officials from Mr Naughten’s department and representatives of Mr McCourt.Concerns about the rising cost of the National Broadband Plan have been growing in Government for months. While Ministers are afraid of a political backlash in rural Ireland if the project is abandoned, there are concerns about escalating costs and also about the level of demand for high-speed broadband in many rural areas.Last night, Mr Naughten welcomed the findings of the report, “which concludes that I ‘did not influence or seek to influence’ the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt”.However, asked if Mr Naughten could return to the Cabinet, a spokesman for the Taoiseach said, “There is no vacancy at Cabinet.“The Taoiseach considers it a partial or qualified vindication. As the Smyth report finds, the private meetings with McCourt, of which the former minister did not give a full account of to the Dáil, were a cause for serious concern,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

At least three of the men are in hospital.State television has broadcast footage from the interrogation of three of the captives, including an officer who, while reading from a screen, said the ships had deliberately ignored Russian requests to stop.The head of the Ukrainian navy said the sailors had been forced to give false testimony, noting that several of the men had relatives in Crimea.Russian ships rammed a tugboat and opened fire on two gunboats that were trying to reach the Ukrainian port of Mariupol through the Kerch Strait on Sunday. A Russian FSB security service officer escorts a detained Ukrainian sailor to a courthouse in Simferopol, CrimeaThe Ukrainian security service said Tuesday that a Russian jet had also fired rockets during the incident, seriously injuring one officer. Special forces later boarded the vessels.Russia has claimed the incident was a planned “provocation,” while Ukraine has called it an act of aggression.Although the Azov Sea is by a 2003 treaty supposed to be shared between Ukraine and Russia, the Kerch Strait connecting it to the Black Sea has been controlled by Moscow since it annexed Crimea in 2014.Russia has been demanding that ships receive permission to pass after it opened a bridge over the strait in May.In a phone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel late on Monday, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, accused Kiev of “creating yet another conflict situation” before March\u0027s presidential election in Ukraine, according to a Kremlin read-out.On Tuesday, Russian state media footage showed Bal anti-ship missiles moving from Sevastopol to the Kerch Strait. For over four years, Russia has backed separatists in a conflict in Eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,300 people. Tensions have also been rising in the Azov Sea as both sides have detained each other\u0027s fishing vessels. But Sunday\u0027s incident marked the first time Russia has openly attacked Ukrainian forces.The UK has condemned Russia\u0027s “destabilising behaviour in the region and its ongoing violation of Ukrainian territorial integrity”.At an emergency session of the United Nations on Monday, Russia said the Ukrainian vessels deliberately did not wait for permission to pass through the strait, which was temporarily closed.The passage under the bridge had been blocked with a tanker.But Ukraine said its ships had waited for permission and began withdrawing from the area after they were buzzed by Russian helicopters.Speaking on CNN on Tuesday, president Petro Poroshenko said Russia had concentrated a large number of troops near Ukraine\u0027s borders, citing Nato intelligence. Ukraine\u0027s parliament had previously agreed to impose martial law after Mr Poroshenko claimed he had information that Russia was planning a ground operation.Dispatch: Years of war in Ukraine leaves one million on the breadlineIt had looked as though March\u0027s presidential election, in which Mr Poroshenko is trailing in the polls, would be delayed. But following a backlash, the measures were watered down and will be implemented for only one month and only in 10 regions.The incident will likely boost the ratings of both Mr Putin and Mr Poroshenko. Since the annexation of Crimea, Russia has imprisoned several Ukrainians in controversial trials, including Crimean director Oleg Sentsov.In 2016, military pilot Nadiya Savchenko was sentenced to 22 years in prison by a Moscow court after being captured in eastern Ukraine.

Ms Han’s husband, Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank, stands accused of being at the centre of one of China’s largest bank frauds, totalling £1 billion.Ms Han is being held in a secret jail, and her children have not been allowed to leave China since arriving this summer to visit a sick relative, according to the New York Times. By holding them hostage, Chinese authorities are hoping to flush out Mr Liu and to force him to return to China to face charges.Since coming to power in 2012, Xi Jinping, China’s president, has waged a brutal anti-corruption crackdown, a campaign critics say is about shooting down political enemies. About 1.5 million government officials have been punished for wrongdoing and dramatic stings have uncovered piles of hidden cash.In 2015, authorities launched “Operation Skynet,” which targeted former officials suspected of fleeing the country with illicit gains. That same year, Interpol issued a “red notice” for Mr Liu, one of the names on the “Skynet” list. His whereabouts remain unknown, and is reportedly no longer in touch with his now detained family members.China’s foreign ministry has confirmed and defended the holding of the trio. “Because they are suspected of economic crimes, they are restricted from exiting the country by the Chinese police in accordance with the law,” said spokesperson Geng Shuang. While all three travelled to China on US passports, they also hold legal and valid identity documents as Chinese citizens, he said.Although China doesn’t recognise dual citizenship, and considers those with a foreign passport as having renounced Chinese citizenship, authorities have in recent years begun exerting power over all ethnic Chinese, regardless of whether they hold foreign passports.While Chinese activists and dissidents have long been subject to travel bans, the case involving Ms Han and the Lius is notable given their US status. At least one, Victor Liu, was born in America and not a naturalised citizen.The risk has become so great that the US State Department issued a travel advisory earlier this year. “Exit bans have been imposed to compel US citizens to resolve business disputes, force settlement of court orders, or facilitate government investigations,” the notice said.“Iniduals not involved in legal proceedings or suspected of wrongdoing have also been subjected to lengthy exit bans in order to compel their family members or colleagues to cooperate with Chinese courts or investigators.”It’s hard to know the full number of those in China affected by exit bans, say human rights experts - often people don’t know until they try to leave.“Some people can buy a ticket with their passport, but when they arrive at the airport and try to pass immigration, they aren’t allowed to,” said Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Amnesty International, a human rights group.Last month, a Singaporean national working for UBS, a Swiss bank, was barred from leaving China.Chinese authorities seem to have become more emboldened in what they’re willing to do. China has before convicted and executed foreigners, even kidnapping foreign nationals from other countries – in 2015, government agents kidnapped Gui Minhai, a book publisher and Swedish citizen, from Thailand, and he remains in custody in China.Another recent mystery was the disappearance of former Interpol head, Meng Hongwei, a Chinese citizen who lived in France and eventually surfaced in China amidst allegations of bribery and violating unspecified laws.The US embassy in Beijing didn’t respond to a request for comment.Cynthia Liu was due to start a new job with McKinsey \u0026amp Co, a consultancy, and her brother, Victor, is a student at Georgetown University in Washington.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Norway-style deal will be considered if Theresa May’s plan is blocked by Parliament, Chancellor suggests - live updatesNo deal Brexit and staying in the EU both more popular with voters than Theresa May\u0026#39s agreement, new poll findsAn \u0026#39alarm bell\u0026#39: Experts warn HIV has hit a 10 year high in Europe ahead of 30th World Aids DayIndia bans homework and heavy schoolbags to prevent spinal damageLabour drop investigation into Ian Austin MP over alleged abusive behaviour amid anti-Semitism crisisMrs Wilson, BBC One, review: a remarkable story – but how true is it?Chinese scientist \u0026#39proud\u0026#39 of gene-editing trial despite international outcryUniversities with soaring grades may be forced to introduce common marking criteriaDoctors warn patient care given lower priority in Scottish NHS than money and targetsComment: What Enid Blyton taught me about female friendship Police investigating attack on \u0026#39Syrian refugee\u0026#39 at Huddersfield school as £30,000 raised for bullying victimDonald Trump may cancel Putin meeting over Russia\u0026#39s seizure of ships in CrimeaDonald Trump\u0026#39s campaign chief refutes claims he \u0026#39secretly met with Julian Assange\u0026#39Lion Air plane \u0026#39not airworthy\u0026#39, say investigatorsUS sued for $60 million after infant in detention later diedWalter Reed lockdown confirmed to be a drillSilk stockings and bath oils will not be funded by NHS under new plansEnergy customers left on hold for an hour and a half, Which? study finds  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chinese scientist says gene editing trial paused international","story":"A Chinese scientist at the centre of a controversy over what he claims are the world\u0027s first genetically edited children said on Wednesday he was proud of his work and revealed that another volunteer is pregnant as part of the research.He Jiankui, an associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, addressed a packed hall of around 700 people attending the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong.For this case, I feel proud. I feel proudest, He said, when challenged by several peers at the conference.This study has been submitted to a scientific journal for review, He said. He did not name the journal and said his university was unaware of his study.However, he said the trial has now been paused in the wake of the outcry.Chinese scientist He Jiankui speaks at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong KongI must apologise this result was leaked unexpectedly, said He. The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation, he added.He, who said his work was self-funded, shrugged off concerns that the research was conducted in secrecy, explaining that he had engaged the scientific community over the past three years.In videos posted online this week, He said he used a gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born this month.He Jiankui defended his workHe said gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.But scientists and the Chinese government have denounced the work that He said he carried out, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged. A total of eight volunteer couples – HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers – had signed up to the trial, with one dropping out before it was halted.The conference moderator, Robin Lovell-Badge, said the summit organisers were unaware of the story until it broke this week.A leader of the international conference on gene editing said He\u0027s work showed a failure of self-regulation among scientists.Nobel laureate David Baltimore said the work would be considered irresponsible because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered.Baltimore said he didn\u0027t think that was medically necessary. He said the case showed there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field.CRISPR-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut and paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are concerns about safety and ethics.More than 100 scientists, most in China, said in an open letter on Tuesday the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was dangerous and unjustified. Pandora\u0027s box has been opened, they said.He\u0027s research focuses on genome sequencing technology, bioinformatics and genome editing, according to his biography on the summit\u0027s website.He received his PhD at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in Stephen Quake lab at Stanford University according to the site.Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Norway-style deal will be considered if Theresa May’s plan is blocked by Parliament, Chancellor suggests - live updatesNo deal Brexit and staying in the EU both more popular with voters than Theresa May\u0026#39s agreement, new poll findsAn \u0026#39alarm bell\u0026#39: Experts warn HIV has hit a 10 year high in Europe ahead of 30th World Aids DayIndia bans homework and heavy schoolbags to prevent spinal damageLabour drop investigation into Ian Austin MP over alleged abusive behaviour amid anti-Semitism crisisHow China uses \u0026#39exit bans\u0026#39 on relatives to force suspected fugitives to returnMrs Wilson, BBC One, review: a remarkable story – but how true is it?Universities with soaring grades may be forced to introduce common marking criteriaDoctors warn patient care given lower priority in Scottish NHS than money and targetsComment: What Enid Blyton taught me about female friendship Police investigating attack on \u0026#39Syrian refugee\u0026#39 at Huddersfield school as £30,000 raised for bullying victimDonald Trump may cancel Putin meeting over Russia\u0026#39s seizure of ships in CrimeaDonald Trump\u0026#39s campaign chief refutes claims he \u0026#39secretly met with Julian Assange\u0026#39Lion Air plane \u0026#39not airworthy\u0026#39, say investigatorsUS sued for $60 million after infant in detention later diedWalter Reed lockdown confirmed to be a drillSilk stockings and bath oils will not be funded by NHS under new plansEnergy customers left on hold for an hour and a half, Which? study finds  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/28/TELEMMGLPICT000161500449_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEPGeX_Yp7hmXpGUPDpSlJjYB2zuTDE1kSbLvVcQ5x7Y.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"labour drop investigation ian austin mp alleged abusive behaviour","story":"Labour drop investigation into Ian Austin MP over alleged abusive behaviour amid anti-Semitism crisisLabour has dropped an investigation into one of its own MPs over alleged abusive behaviour during the party\u0027s anti-Semitism crisis.Ian Austin confronted Labour chairman Ian Lavery amid a row over the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism in July of this year.The member for Dudley North MP released a statement this afternoon saying: I make no apologies for being upset about anti-Semitism - I think every Labour Party member ought to be angry about racism and the failure to deal with it properly, but I did not scream abuse as was alleged, so I am pleased the Labour Party have dropped its threat to hold an investigation.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

The watchdog also said that while the number of calls to 118 numbers has been falling by around 40 per cent each year, more than a million people in the UK still use them, particularly the elderly. Jane Rumble, Ofcom’s director of consumer policy, said: “Directory enquiry prices have risen in recent years, and callers are paying much more than they expect. Our evidence shows this is hurting people, with some struggling to pay their bills.“We’re taking action to protect callers by capping 118 prices. This will significantly cut the cost of many calls, and bring them back to 2012 levels.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cliff edge of no deal, or trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms.As the date on which the UK is meant to leave the European Union approaches, and as the terms of the deal negotiated by Theresa May have been released, a raft of new economic forecasts has appeared. We at the UK in a Changing Europe have contributed our own assessment. But what do the forecasts say? And, more importantly, what do they mean?Theresa May’s Brexit deal may yet get through ParliamentFirst, the top line results. Our findings are based on considering the impacts of the deal on trade and immigration, and forecasting their effect. Our analysis suggests that the Brexit deal negotiated by the Prime Minister could reduce UK GDP per capita by between 1.9 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.5 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030, compared to remaining in the EU. The cost to the public finances would be between 0.4 and 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspof GDP over the same period, with the corresponding figures for a no-deal Brexit 1 to 3.1 per cent.So far so economicky. But what, exactly, do these figures mean? Well, to get a sense of the scale of the fiscal impact, the deal negotiated by the Prime Minister would reduce tax receipts by some £9bn\u0026nbspby 2030 – more than the entire budget for GPs in England. And this is the low end of the range. The worst case is a hit of some £37bn\u0026nbsp– almost equivalent to the current entire health and social care budget.And to compare to a recent economic crisis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the impact of the financial crisis on the economy was £300bn over a decade. The equivalent forecast from our study for the withdrawal deal is a range between £40bn and £110bn. This is a large range, obviously, but it does underline that the scale of the hit will be smaller than that inflicted after 2008. But, of course, our economy has been seriously weakened already by the financial crisis, making it less resilient to another shock.The next question, then, is how the Brexit impact will reveal itself. Which brings us back to cliff edges. The problem with this analogy is that the implications of leaving the European Union will not be felt overnight. Rather, as John Springford has pointed out, they are already being felt, and will continue to be so over time as we actually leave the single market and introduce friction to our trade with our largest and closest trading partner.A better analogy is a slow puncture. For two reasons. First, it can take a while to notice a slow puncture. And, second, it is hard, once it has become apparent, to remember when and where you picked it up. When it comes to the politics of the economic impact, in other words, the simple causal story that “Brexit has made us poorer”\u0026nbspmay be harder to tell than many Remainers think – not least given the lack of faith in forecasts that was one result of the referendum campaign itself.Talking of the politics, we could do with a bit more honesty from both big parties about what Brexit might mean. Perhaps the most depressing thing – among many competitors – at the last election was the way the manifestos seemed to assume that, post-Brexit, it would be business as usual. It won’t. The public finances will be even more stretched and the economy will not grow as fast as it would have done. At the very least, some planning for this eventuality would be most welcome.Obviously, economic modelling is not an exact science, and in order to produce the analysis set out in our report, we have had to make a large number of assumptions, some of them subjective. Moreover, economic models provide at best an imperfect map of the world. For example, our model requires us to transform the legal language of the Withdrawal Agreement into assumptions about percentage changes in non-tariff barriers. This is relies on informed judgment more than scientific measurement. Equally, there is insufficient detail in the Withdrawal Agreement to know exactly how the customs backstop would operate or the extent of future regulatory ergence between the UK and the EU. This introduces additional uncertainty into our assumptions.Yet all this notwithstanding – and it is important to accept the limitations of this kind of work – these findings represent our best judgement about the impact of the deal. That does not mean they will be correct—indeed, they almost certainly will be inaccurate to some extent – but we would maintain that are our broad conclusions are credible.Brexit will inflict some harm on our economy. Which is not necessarily a compelling case against it. But is something we, and our political leaders, should be honest about.\u0026nbspAnand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The watchdog also said that while the number of calls to 118 numbers has been falling by around 40 per cent each year, more than a million people in the UK still use them, particularly the elderly. Jane Rumble, Ofcom’s director of consumer policy, said: “Directory enquiry prices have risen in recent years, and callers are paying much more than they expect. Our evidence shows this is hurting people, with some struggling to pay their bills.“We’re taking action to protect callers by capping 118 prices. This will significantly cut the cost of many calls, and bring them back to 2012 levels.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But for young men, signing up to tens of thousands of pounds of debt might not seem as attractive.\u0026nbspThe government data, which has been analysed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), suggests that thousands of men are enrolling on university courses each year that leave them worse off in future earnings\u0026nbspby\u0026nbspthe end of their twenties than their peers who opted to avoid higher education altogether.\u0026nbspIt is likely to reignite the age-old debate about whether university is worth it – especially for a specific group of male undergraduates. Men\u0026nbspwith low prior attainment, and no science or maths A-levels, only saw a small rise (4 per cent) in their earnings at age 29 compared with peers who went straight to work.Top university gives ‘no significant earnings boost to male students’And the picture for all male graduates is most stark in subjects\u0026nbsplike creative arts, English and philosophy, where they actually earn less than their peers who are not saddled with student debt. \u0026nbspThe data shows that studying philosophy at the University of Sussex leaves male graduates with the worst returns (-73 per cent), while computing at the University of Westminster (-66 per cent) is the worst for female graduates.\u0026nbspCreative arts courses at higher education institutions also feature in the bottom five for both male and female graduates for their earnings return, the figures show.\u0026nbspWhile the data may be depressing to some, it is no helpful that prospective students at least have more transparency around salary outcomes for different subjects. The introduction of £9,250 a year tuition fees has made this more pressing. \u0026nbspHowever, there is a danger that a focus\u0026nbspsolely on earnings potential could distract\u0026nbspfrom some of the other benefits of higher education that cannot be as easily measured.\u0026nbspStudents may be put off from studying creative arts because of poor financial outcomes. But this is not everything. Many who\u0026nbspgraduate in that subject\u0026nbspmay go on to contribute hugely\u0026nbspto the arts industry – and perhaps even\u0026nbspbecome stars of the West End in due course – even though their earnings in their twenties may not indicate\u0026nbspsuccess later in their career. \u0026nbspUniversities are only better for women because we have more to loseTop university gives ‘no significant earnings boost to male students’University ‘leaves male graduates in some subjects worse off’Certainly many in the higher education sector argue that a snapshot of earnings at age 29 does not tell the full picture.So yes, the data offers useful insights\u0026nbsp– especially for students making decisions about what and where to study. And universities that are offering courses\u0026nbspgenerally known to increase earnings, like economics, but that\u0026nbspfail to get significantly positive returns for students should be held to account. \u0026nbspBut it is important not to jump the gun. Going to university should not all be about salaries, and context is needed when judging institutions – especially specialist arts providers –\u0026nbspon outcomes.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So the (economic) returns for a woman in going to university are relatively bigger than they are for men.”Men without a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)\u0026nbspA-level, with lower prior attainment, receive even lower returns from attending university –\u0026nbsponly a 4 per cent increase in their earnings compared to peers who did not attend university.This group is more likely to take lower-returning subjects on average, end up earning less money\u0026nbspwhen they study the same subject, and study at lower-status universities.In 2016-17, just over 128,000 male students enrolled in creative arts, English, philosophy, agriculture, communications and languages – among the seven lowest-returning subjects. The number of male psychology students was not available from the Higher Education Statistics Agency.The earnings calculations were made by looking at the earnings of graduates from the middle 50 per cent of institutions – those in the 25th to the 75th\u0026nbsppercentile.The report also highlights great variation between courses\u0026nbspat universities. For example, men who study economics at the highest-returning institution see their earnings almost doubled – but at the lowest-returning university, the earnings for male graduates are reduced by 23 per cent.Mr Gyimah has called on the OfS to do more to expose the university courses that do not deliver value. He said: “We have got to put that out there so prospective students know –\u0026nbspand to force the university to actually delist that course, or actually improve the course.”“I believe that transparency is the best disinfectant here,” he added.The minister said\u0026nbspuniversities need to deliver courses that are employer-focused and\u0026nbsprecognised by the industry. “We have got to improve the quality of the university offering so that it delivers for students who are investing a significant amount of money into their education,” he said.A spokesperson for the National Union of Students (NUS) said: “There is a danger that, amidst calls for greater transparency in how fee income is spent, the ‘value’\u0026nbspof a degree is reduced to solely inidual financial outcomes. It risks neglecting the other substantial benefits that a university education can give to both the student and society.”They added: “Some of our greatest institutions –\u0026nbspsuch as Guildhall School of Music and Drama – attract the lowest financial return. This is because an arts career attracts a lower salary, not because of the quality of the university’s teaching. I find it hard to believe that anybody could argue that an institution that gave the world actors such as Daniel Craig and Jodie Whittaker is failing it’s students.“The government has already moved the burden of fee income entirely onto the inidual student, and now is threatening to limit the opportunities for young people to add to Britain’s rich cultural and artistic heritage by falsely conflating what a student earns with the value of their education to both themselves and society as a whole.”Created with Sketch.Best Universities for Life Sciences and Medicine Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyKarolinska Institutet, Main entrance from Solnavägen with the \u0027Aula Medica\u0027 in the backgroundUniversity of California, Los Angeles campusUniversity of California, Hastings College of LawYale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript LibraryUniversity of MelbourneUniversity of TorontoThe Geisel Library on the San Diego campus of the University of CaliforniaUniversity of SydneyUniversity of SingaporeAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “This study shows that for many people – and women in particular – going to university enhances both their employability and earnings potential.“However, the focus on what’s in someone’s pay packet at age 29 ignores the wider benefits of being a graduate: building networks, growing in confidence, developing life skills, the joy of learning as well as enhancing career opportunities and earnings over a lifetime, including a higher chance of being employed.”He added: “It is incorrect to assume all iniduals have higher salaries in the early part of their careers as their primary motivation. Many graduates work in vital roles in the public and charitable sectors or creative industries that make hugely valuable contributions to society and enrich our lives.“What this data highlights is the real need for those entering higher education to have the best possible information to help them choose what and where to study – but earnings are not the sole measure of learning outcomes.\u0026nbsp“Universities UK has called for the government to work in partnership with universities, colleges and schools to provide clear and tailored information to prospective students on the costs and benefits of higher education.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said the new report showed there are still “clear financial benefits” in getting a university degree.“It is crucial that prospective students have access to high quality information about where, what and how they might study,” said Ms Dandridge. “This research provides a wealth of data to let students understand how the course and institution they choose may affect their earnings potential.”She added: “Of course, better financial prospects are only one reason why people go to university. Higher education also delivers important social and educational benefits to inidual students and society as a whole. There are also many rewarding careers that may not attract high salaries, especially early in someone’s career.“But universities should scrutinise this data carefully, and some will need to ask themselves tough questions about how well they are preparing students for life after graduation.”Office for StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk\u0027s rocket business is preparing for manned trips to Mars in the coming years, with the hope of making them relatively easily available.Do we really have a right to colonise Mars?You\u0027re 47, Mr Musk was asked as part of an interview for Axios\u0027s\u0026nbspnew show on HBO. What is the likelihood you personally will go to Mars?70 per cent, he replied\u0026nbspimmediately. We\u0027ve recently made a number of breakthroughs that I\u0027m just really fired up about.He went on to explain that he was talking about moving there, and that the price for the trip might eventually be only a couple of hundred thousand dollars.Pressed on whether he was working towards building an escape hatch for rich people, he said that the journey was going to be far more difficult than staying on our own planet would be.Your\u0026nbspprobability of dying on Mars if much higher than dying on Earth, he said, comparing it with Shackleton\u0027s trip to the Antarctic.It\u0027s going to be hard, there\u0027s a good chance of\u0026nbspdeath, going in a little can through deep space, he said.\u0026nbspYou might land successfully, once you land successfully you\u0027ll be working non-stop to build the base. So not much time for leisure.And once you get there, even after doing all this, it\u0027s a very harsh environment so there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll die there. We\u0026nbspthink you can come back but we\u0027re not sure. Now does that sound like an escape hatch for rich people?Despite all that he said he would unhesitatingly go and live on the planet, once SpaceX\u0026nbspmakes it possible.There\u0027s lots of people that climb mountains., he said. People die on Mount Everest all the time. They like doing it for the challenge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

All other explanations are unfounded.”Sir Elton’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, said to be his last, had already caused a stir among fans for the price of its tickets.Some fans paid as much as £520 for tickets to the UK leg of the tour in 2019 and 2020.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In its provisional findings, released on Wednesday, the CMA said competition between the two firms currently is “helping to drive quality and innovation in both free and paid-for credit checking services as they develop their products to vie for customers”. Energy set for big five players after CMA clears npower, SSE deal Will Sainsbury\u0027s-Asda sell 73 stores or more than 200? CMA says Sky takeover \u0027not in public interest’ – does it matter?CMA talks tough on energy networks but it\u0027s an easy win Removing one of the competitors from the market, the CMA said, would “substantially reduce the pressure to continue to develop innovative offers and to make other improvements in services”.Roland Green, the CMA inquiry chair, said: “Our investigation has shown that this is a fast-paced and evolving market, and that both Experian and ClearScore are an important part of that.“The provisional findings in our investigation show that Experian’s proposed takeover of ClearScore is likely to weaken competition in the sector and have a negative effect on the services offered to customers.”A spokesperson for Experian said the company was “disappointed” by the CMA’s provisional findings. “We continue to strongly believe that the acquisition of ClearScore will have a positive impact on competition, allowing Experian to help more consumers with their finances by providing greater choice and convenience to them to access personal finance products at the best prices,” he said. “We also believe we will be able innovate more and better through the combination of the parties’ complementary assets and innovation cultures. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA over the weeks ahead to seek to address its concerns ahead of publication of the CMA’s final report early in the new year.”The CMA has asked for views on its provisional findings, to be provided by 19 December. The watchdog said it will assess all evidence before making a final decision on the deal early next yearShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest,”\u0026nbspMr Collins told the paper.Facebook had some “very serious questions” to answer, he said, and he accused it of misleading the committee over Russian involvement in the platform.“It has not answered our questions about who knew what, with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” Mr Collins said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.“We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.“We have no further comment.”\u0026nbspThe move comes after Mark Zuckerberg said he was “unable” to testify to an international “grand committee” investigating Facebook’s role in spreading fake news.The social media company will instead send Richard Allan, its vice president of policy solutions, to answer questions at a hearing in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Try to peer back further, though, and everything changes. The visual, intellectual, spiritual, and day-to-day world of the age that came before seems maddeningly hard to grasp.Back in the 1930s, the authors of 1066 And All That captured something of the frustration: “Egg-Kings were found on the thrones of all these kingdoms, such as Eggberd, Eggbreth, Eggfroth, etc. None of them, however, succeeded in becoming memorable – except in so far as it is difficult to forget such names as Eggborth, Eggbred, Eggbeard, Eggfish, etc. Nor is it even remembered by what kind of Eggdeath they perished.”However, the low middle ages are not truly lost. Pre-conquest England is there – it is just well hidden. Occasional church towers or windows and museum cabinets of jewellery hint at a vibrant period, but it is in books and manuscripts that the Anglo-Saxons come vividly alive, delineated in everything from pale rusty ink to lush gold and lapis. In these texts we meet a vigorous and confident cast of warriors and saints, queens and kings, thegns and villagers, dragons and gods.Anglo-Saxon books are now spread all over Britain and Europe. In a moment of inspiration in 2013, the British Library decided to gather an unprecedented number of them together under one roof.Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War is now open, and its 180 exhibits froth and bubble with the whirlpool of fresh ideas and vibrant images that animated England for 700 years. With modern Britain unable to formulate a coherent 21st century identity for itself, the timing of this voyage into the past could not be more relevant.A quick reminder. Anglo-Saxon England thrived from the early AD400s to 1066. As Roman administrators and military commanders hitched their skirts, clambered onto boats, and waved “Valete!” to Britannia, boatloads of Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians eagerly arrived to fill the vacuum.\u0026nbspThe precise details of these migrations remain unclear. Some of the settlers may have been invited as mercenaries to fend off the raiding Scots (from Ireland) and Picts (from Scotland), while others almost certainly arrived to pillage and conquer. Many indigenous Britons were not thrilled. Warlords like Arthur (who may merely be an avatar for others) fought back hard. Yet despite the fierce resistance – the Historia Brittonum tells us Arthur alone slew 960 at the battle of Mount Badon – the settlers prevailed, put down roots, and built communities. Before long the newcomers from modern-day Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands had taken over, and Angle-land (England) emerged.The British Library’s timing is impeccable because the energetic imagination and international adventurousness of the Anglo-Saxons points to a profoundly dynamic period in which England buzzed at the intellectual, spiritual, artistic, and mercantile heart of Europe.9th century\u0026nbsp(British Library)Although there is little room for the Anglo-Saxons in crammed television schedules and bookshops already groaning with Plantagenets and Tudors, the Anglo-Saxons were every bit as important to the development of England. In fact, more so, as they founded it.“The Anglo-Saxon period was a formative one, both for the English and their British and European neighbours,” says Dr Levi Roach, a leading expert from the University of Exeter. “Be it in our towns and villages, our shires and counties, even our names for ourselves (‘English’, ‘Welsh’, ‘Scottish’), they have left an indelible mark.”If you look hard enough, life in modern Britain still has countless legacies of the Anglo-Saxons. Undoubtedly their most important bequest was their language: Ænglisc. (In Old English “sc” is pronounced “sh”, as in biscop or scip.) While the language has always been important in Britain and was exported to the New World and empire, its significance has grown even more in the last generation, with globalisation establishing English as the planet’s emerging lingua franca.This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one anotherEnglish may now be ubiquitous, but we rarely credit the Anglo-Saxons for its deep beauty and profound flexibility. For many – like the prime minister – “Anglo-Saxon language” is merely a periphrasis for swearing. This is a pitiful characterisation. Anglo-Saxon (these days rebranded as Old English) is the bedrock of modern English. And actually, there is no evidence any Anglo-Saxon ever uttered the F-word, the notorious monosyllable, or a wide range of other four-letter words.When we want to laud the beauties of historic English, instead of celebrating Anglo-Saxon, we usually skip straight to Shakespeare and the King James Bible. But while both have given us shimmering words and phrases, they were doing no more than wrapping ropes of fairy lights around an already solid, beautiful, old\u0026nbspand leafy tree. The fact is that long before the Globe Theatre rocked with applause, and even before Chaucer’s pilgrims met at the nearby Tabard two centuries earlier, the Anglo-Saxons were speaking and writing the earliest, luscious English.\u0026nbsp“English is a Germanic language,” explains Dr Alison Hudson, co-curator of the British Library’s exhibition. “Anglo-Saxon is the basis of some of its vocabulary and structure.” But the Anglo-Saxons were also devoted linguistic magpies, adept at incorporating new words and ideas. “One of the language’s unique marvels is its flexibility to absorb other elements, like Latin, Old Norse, and Norman French. In this period, we see loan words like ‘pepper’ and ‘cinnamon’ coming into English for the first time. It’s a wonderful reflection of the fact that the British Isles have always been a multicultural place. They even had the word ‘ylp’ for elephant. It’s one of my favourite Old English words. They had no idea what one actually looked like – they imagined it had white polka dots on pink skin – but it was an important enough part of their intellectual world to create a word for it.”Language weaves its way through the exhibition in a similar way to the bright swirls of decoration burnishing many of the old pages. At the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era we see jagged runes cut into objects from a time when daily life revolved around the old gods and goddesses. As, in a small way, ours still do. Tiw, ruler of sky and war, is still honoured by a day of the week, as is Woden, head of the gods, Thunor, the thunder god, and Frige, goddess of the home and love. Some of these inscriptions are charmingly timeless, like the discreet marketing on the reverse of a piece of delicate gold, ivory, and garnet jewellery: “Luda repaired the brooch”.Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600 (Dominic Selwood)The Anglo-Saxons did not cling to the old Germanic gods for long. In 597 St Augustine arrived to re-Christianise England, and one glass case holds an astonishing 6th century book of the four gospels, in Latin, believed to have been in his luggage.Augustine and his companions persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to adopt the religion of Rome, and the new converts became some of its most devout followers. Christianity was a book\u0026nbspand writing-based religion, and the old runes fell into disuse as Anglo-Saxon scholars adopted the Roman alphabet for Latin and Old English. For a while, though, runes clung on in places. The exhibition has a replica of the 5.5-metre high Ruthwell Cross with its spectacular carvings from the life of Christ, along with several verses incised in runes evoking lines from “The Dream of the Rood”.The oldest proper text in Old English is King Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600. It is the earliest known utterance of English law, and is the standout exhibit in the exhibition’s first room. It is an extraordinary reminder of just how old our quirky legal system is, with so much of it – including trial by jury – reaching back to principles of Anglo-Saxon justice.As you would expect, the exhibition features stellar examples of Anglo-Saxon art. The mesmerisingly vibrant decoration of the Lindisfarne Gospels (circa\u0026nbsp700) needs no introduction, but equally fascinating are the small words glossed in red ink under the main Latin text. They are in Old English, and represent the earliest known version of the gospels in the vernacular. Strange as this sounds, translating the gospels into English was not that uncommon. The Wessex Gospels – also in the exhibition – were widely copied English versions of the four gospels: something later Tudor scholars in the Protestant Reformation pretended to be undertaking for the first time.What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to usThe cases of books in the darkened series of rooms are interspersed with artefacts conjuring up the Anglo-Saxons’ physical world. The Alfred Jewel has pride of place, as do objects like the 5th century pottery Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person. There are also crowd pleasers from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire and Binham Hoards.When Anglo-Saxon England died as a political entity at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, embroiderers depicted the run-up and battle in 58 captioned scenes on 70 metres of linen. Many of its panels show daily life either side of the Channel, preserving one of the richest records of late Anglo-Saxon society. Although the political and military narrative in the Bayeux\u0026nbspTapestry is Norman propaganda – telling their story of why William had God on his side – it is notably sympathetic to King Harold of England, and one of the reasons may be that the embroidery was perhaps made by Anglo-Saxons in Kent. Anglo-Saxon needlecraft – opus anglicanum (English work) – was world famous. The Bayeux Tapestry is not, however, in the exhibition, although President Macron has promised to send it for a visit in the near future, which will be the first time it has crossed the Channel in 900 years.The Anglo-Saxons were energetic travellers and traders, in constant contact with Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In one glass case there is an astonishing late 4th century book that made it to Anglo-Saxon England all the way from North Africa – possibly in the baggage of Hadrian, a “vir natione Afir” (man of African birth) who travelled to England in 669 and ended up as abbot of Canterbury. In another is a gold coin minted by Offa, who ruled Mercia from 757-96. Although it predictably reads “Offa Rex” on the front, it is modelled on an Islamic dinar, with Arabic writing on the back including “there is no God but Allah alone”. With travel came a thirst for knowledge, and the Anglo-Saxons were also scientists. Books in the exhibition contain diagrams of the planetary orbits and affirmations that the Earth is round.For the real soul of the Anglo-Saxons – the rhythms of their lives, loves, and deeds – there is one standout case. In it are just four books whose names will have any manuscript nerd’s pulse racing. The first is the British Library’s own Cotton Vitellius A XV. It is fire ravaged, but magically preserves the sole surviving copy of Beowulf. Alongside it lies the Vercelli Book – in Britain for the first time in 900 years – containing the only manuscript version of the mystical and haunting “Dream of the Rood”. Next to it is the Junius\u0026nbspManuscript from the Bodleian. Its poems have largely religious themes, and the page is open on “Genesis A”, which offers a good sense of their preoccupations with its nine mentions of heofan and helle. The final volume is the Exeter Book, on loan from Exeter Cathedral. It shimmers with dozens of well-known, ravishing poems, including “The Seafarer” and “The Wanderer”, and lies open on a riddle asking which creature eats words but gains no wisdom. (Spoiler: a bookmoth.) Apart from the transcendent beauty of the words and imagery in these four books, an equally extraordinary feature of them is that they contain around 75 per cent of all surviving Old English poetry.Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, from the 5th century (Dominic Selwood)“What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to us,” explains Professor Carolyne Larrington, an expert in Old English and medieval European literature at Oxford. “This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one another.”The single manuscript copies of Beowulf and “The Dream of the Rood” witness the remarkably poor survival rate of Old English texts. This has nothing to do with either the amount the Anglo-Saxons wrote or the quality of their materials. They wrote prolifically, and their vellum and bindings were perfectly robust, as many books in the exhibition demonstrate, with thumping leather-tooled and richly gem-studded covers showing no signs of fragility.\u0026nbspThe loss of so much Anglo-Saxon writing has far more to do with the purposeful and systematic 16th century destruction of monastic and university libraries by the Tudors, whose religious policies saw bonfires and rubbish heaps made of books that referred to England’s medieval faith. Religious sculpture, too, was also decimated. The original Ruthwell Cross, with its extraordinary runic poetry inscriptions, was smashed into fragments by Protestant extremists in the 1640s, but was meticulously reassembled in the 1820s, and now stands inside Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire.\u0026nbspLater, a handful of notable figures tried to repair the damage and locate the books and manuscripts that had been scattered. “Despair over the fate of the contents of monastic libraries crossed confessional boundaries,” explains Professor Helen Parish, an expert in late medieval and Reformation history at the University of Reading. “The former Carmelite turned ardent evangelical, John Bale, had little sympathy with the trappings of monasticism, but still complained bitterly that the dispersal of the libraries was to the shame of the country. Matthew Parker, first archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, worked hard in the 1560s to recover lost books and records. His library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided the building blocks for a new history of the English church, and a burgeoning sense of national faith and identity in which the Anglo-Saxon church was the cornerstone.”\u0026nbspOne especially notable feature of the surviving corpus of Old English poetry is the prominence of women characters. Hudson explains:\u0026nbsp“There are a surprising number of Anglo-Saxon epics of strong women. Biblical characters like Judith, saints like Juliana – a Middle Eastern martyr who battled and conquered demons – and royalty like the Empress Helena. In the Genesis poem in the Junius manuscript, even Eve emerges as a notably prominent character.”Strong women are not only part of the Anglo-Saxons’ poetic world. They were part of everyday life, too. Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and wife of Æthelred of Mercia, was named “Lady of the Mercians” and did more to bring England together as a country than possibly anyone else. Her deeds are recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sits in the same room as the four poetry books. Less regal Anglo-Saxon women’s lives are also fascinating. The exhibition has the late 10th\u0026nbspor early 11th century will of the noble widow Wynflæd, and it contains two arresting provisions. On her death she freed some of her slaves, but not Eadgifu the weaver or Æthelgifu the seamstress. And she could read, as she carefully passed on her prized collection of books.\u0026nbspIf asked to name an Old English poem, many people would nominate Beowulf. It is rightly one of the most famous stories in Anglo-Scandinavian literature, and the original manuscript does not disappoint. The poem’s 3,182 lines throb with a ripping tale of the warrior Beowulf’s mortal combat with the monster Grendel and his mother and, years later, with a dragon. The epic’s ability to transfix and delight wins new admirers every generation: most recently with Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney’s free translation in 1999 and Hollywood warhorse Robert Zemeckis’s epic A-list motion capture blockbuster in 2007.\u0026nbspAfter Beowulf, the most famous Old English poem is “The Dream of the Rood”, in which the cross of the crucifixion tells its version of the passion story. It opens with the writer having a vision of the cross that will soon speak to him:Listen! I wish to tell of the best of dreams,\u0026nbsp(You only need to know two things to read it aloud: “æ” is pronounced “a” as in “cat” and “ð” and “þ” are both pronounced “th”.)\u0026nbspIf you read, it, two things pop out immediately. The first is that the sound and cadences are deeply rhythmical, and almost certainly mean it was recited to music. The second is that the phrases are built up with a hypnotic alliteration that is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Old English poetry.\u0026nbspIt is, obviously, more challenging than Shakespeare or Chaucer as it has many unfamiliar words and comes complete with case endings. We have managed to get rid of most of them in modern English, although a few like “them” and “whom” stubbornly remain. To add to the challenge, many Old English words have also changed their meaning over time. For instance, “spell” simply meant “story” to the Anglo-Saxons.Old English also had dialects which evolved. The main ones were based in Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex, with Wessex eventually coming to dominate, as it was the language of King Alfred – who was a fervent promoter of literacy – and later of Ælfric, abbot of Eynsham, who wrote and standardised the language prolifically.Selwood)Despite the strange look and feel of some Old English words, there is no reason to be put off. It is not as alien as it may sometimes seem. Neither does it only live in universities, libraries, and museums. JRR Tolkien was an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon for years, and if you enjoy any of the vocabulary of Middle Earth, you are revelling in his profound skill at playing with ancient Germanic-style languages.\u0026nbspOther standout treasures in the exhibition include the pocket-sized St Cuthbert Gospel, which belonged to St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (died 687). It is the oldest European book with an original intact binding, in this instance an exquisitely decorated red goatskin cover, all miraculously preserved by having been placed into the saint’s tomb alongside him.Another is the bible known as the Codex Amiatinus. It was produced alongside the St Cuthbert Gospel at Wearmouth-Jarrow but, by contrast, is vast. With a spine over a foot thick, it takes two people to lift it and is the largest book in the exhibition. It was once one of three identical copies, but Amiatinus is the only one to survive, as soon after it was finished Abbot Ceolfrith (died 716) took it to Italy as a gift to the pope, and its homecoming to England for the exhibition is the first time it has been back in over 1,000 years.\u0026nbspIn the final room of the exhibition, beautifully lit and residing in a central case, is the most famous book ever produced in England. At Christmas 1085, William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his country, its land, and how it was occupied. Foremost in his mind was – as so often with rulers in any age – the question of property ownership and how much tax he could raise from it. Thanks to the Anglo-Saxons’ meticulous organisation of England into counties and hundreds, the research only took his commissioners until\u0026nbsp1\u0026nbspAugust the following year. When it was all written up, the result was nicknamed the Domesday Book, from the Old English “domesdei” – meaning the Day of Judgment – because the book’s record, like that of the Last Judgment, was unappealable.\u0026nbspHistory books will be harsh on us for ignoring YemenA brief history of pop-culture feudsWhy your Halloween witch’s outfit is rooted in a gendered stereotypeOn one level, the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons is something that is better appreciated outside England. We call the world’s English-speaking countries the “Anglosphere”, whereas the French choose the more nuanced “le monde Anglo-Saxon”, hinting at a distinct historic, linguistic, cultural, and philosophical heritage.\u0026nbspThe French also have no real concept of “the Dark Ages”, and the equivalent period in France has no label implying that it was unenlightened. Of course, as the exhibition demonstrates unequivocally, there never was a dark age. It is a myth dreamed up by Whig historians wanting to believe that Europe collapsed from glory into barbarity with the fall of Rome, but from the Normans onwards the British Isles marched unstoppably towards ever more profound progress and civilisation. The other reason the French have no dark ages is, of course, that they did not experience a regime as violent with history and cultural property as the Tudors.It is shameful that we so often start our islands’ history and lists of kings and queens with William the Conqueror, as if before his arrival there was a void with darkness over the deep. Britain had spectacular cultures before 1066, of which the Anglo-Saxons were one. Theirs was an intense, vibrant, literate, artistic, creative, spiritual, intellectual, practical, adventurous, outward-looking, European world. It was also a prize well worth conquering, which is why Cnut the Dane seized the throne in 1016 and William of Normandy followed him 50 years later.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Other titles featured in the agreement include\u0026nbspCharlie and the Great Glass Elevator, George’s Marvellous Medicine, Boy:\u0026nbspTales of Childhood, Going Solo, The Enormous Crocodile, The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me, Henry Sugar, Billy and the Minpins, The Magic Finger, Esio Trot, Dirty Beasts, and Rhyme Stew.Production is scheduled to begin in 2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The InSight lander offers the chance to have an unprecedented look inside Mars itself, finally giving us clues about what it\u0027s made up of and what\u0027s going on in its interior.New Nasa Mars lander sends back \u0027beautiful\u0027 selfie from surfaceThat, in turn, could tell us not only where it came from but might give us a new understanding of how our own planet formed.For now, InSight is charging up its batteries using the solar array that successfully unfolded after the dust had cleared from its perilous landing. Even in the first hours after its arrival, it sent back stunning photos of the Martian surface – and of itself.Now mission control will get to learning about InSight\u0027s\u0026nbsplanding site. They\u0027ll be looking for the best place to deploy, particularly searching for somewhere it can stick its deep sensor into the ground to take readings of the underneath.Once all of that is decided, engineers back at Nasa will build a reconstruction of the landing area to go alongside the already completely accurate clone of the lander itself they have down on Earth. That will allow them to practise on a precise recreation of the situation back on Mars, making sure that everything is perfectly calibrated and ready to get moving.They\u0027ll make sure the InSight lander\u0027s arm can grab the sensors and equipment and place them into the right place on Mars. As well as putting them in place, they will also have to put a shield over the seismometer that keeps it from being damaged by the extreme environment of Mars.All of that is incredibly important because the work up on Mars is so difficult: engineers liken it to playing a claw machine game except without the claw. And it is incredibly\u0026nbspdifficult, too,\u0026nbspbecause messages take so long to be relayed to the lander – in the minutes they take to get between, the thing they have asked the lander to do has already happened, so they are unable to respond quickly.That will take a matter of months. Once everything\u0027s in place, the heat probe will have to actually hammer itself deep down into the Martian surface, using special technology to dig five meters down.Altogether, that\u0027s likely take as many as five months. After that, the actual science work that InSight\u0026nbspaims to do will begin properly.That will involve taking Mars\u0027s vital signs: feeling its temperature, checking its pulse and looking at its reflexes. Taken together, that will give an insight into the way the planet is made up and offer hints at how it came to be.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It will offer an unprecedented insight into the activity beneath that dusty surface.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsEven as the craft makes its way to the ground, engineers will be using their intense practising to ensure that InSight\u0026nbsplands so that its sensors can be used. It will be directed so that even if it lands on a rock, or on its side, it will still be able to stick its sensors into the planet and examine it.Engineers will then decide where they are going to aim those sensors. They will then spend several weeks calibrating them and getting them into place, before they start taking scientific readings.Once they\u0027re in, they will start taking what Nasa refers to the as the planet\u0027s pulse. It will do so using a\u0026nbspseismometer that picks up waves as they move through the interior of the planet, helping understand how active Mars is and what makes it that way.As well as taking the pulse, it will collect other vital signs: it will measure the planet\u0027s temperature. Using a heat flow probe, it will look at how hot Mars\u0027s insides are, allowing us to understand how similar it is to Earth and help explore how both planets came to be.And it will also watch the way the planet moves, tracking its slight wobble on its axis. Using very precise radio antennas, they will watch that movement, helping understand how it is affected by the sun.So far, we have studied Mars from afar and on the ground, with telescopes, satellites and landers. By sticking sensors underneath and inside of Mars, Nasa hopes to get an insight into a planet that could one day soon become home to people.“We’ve studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbour as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The photo was taken after the solar panels successfully folded out from its sides so that its batteries can be charged, and was relayed through the Mars Odyssey orbiter that floats around the planet and sends messages back down to Earth.Tom Hoffman, InSight\u0027s project manager at Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: The InSight team can rest a little easier tonight now that we know the spacecraft solar arrays are deployed and recharging the batteries.Nasa Mars lander successfully touches down on surface of MarsIt\u0027s been a long day for the team.But tomorrow begins an exciting new chapter for InSight: surface operations and the beginning of the instrument deployment phase.Using InSight\u0027s robotic arm, which has a camera attached, the mission team will be able to take more photographs in the coming days, Nasa has said.This will help engineers to assess where to install the spacecraft\u0027s scientific instruments, which will be able to start sending back data to Earth within two to three months.The InSight lander touched down on Mars just before 8pm GMT on Monday, surviving the so-called seven minutes of terror, a tricky landing phase for the robotic probe, travelling at 13,200mph through the planet\u0027s thin atmosphere which provides little friction to slow down.American space agency Nasa\u0027s 814 million dollar (£633 million) two-year mission aims to shine new light on how the Red Planet was formed and its deep structure, by mapping its core, crust and mantle.InSight arrived on Mars\u0027s Elysium Planitia area north of its equator, described as an ideal spot for its flat, rockless surface.It is the first attempt to reach Mars in six years.Three UK-made seismometer instruments are on board InSight, part of a £4 million UK Space Agency effort to measure seismic waves.Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Oxford who created the instruments will be based at Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California to assist with the study, including selecting the best spot for the robot arm to place the seismometer.It is wonderful news that the InSight spacecraft has landed safely on Mars, said Sue Horne, head of space exploration at the UK Space Agency.The UK scientists and engineers involved in this mission have committed several years of their lives to building the seismometer on board, and the descent is always a worrying time.We can now look forward to the deployment of the instrument and the data that will start to arrive in the new year, to improve our understanding of how the planet formed.A second instrument will burrow five metres into the ground of Mars, measuring the planet\u0027s temperature, while a third experiment will determine how Mars wobbles on its axis.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But based on previous performance it may never get the chance.More Martian craft have got lost trying to make their way through the thin Martian atmosphere than have successfully landed. Even in recent years, spacecraft have regularly failed on their approach and smashed into the surface, not to be heard from again.The InSight lander has made it 300 million miles over six months since it jetted off from space.

Slowed by friction, deployment of a giant parachute and retro rockets, InSight will descend 77 miles through pink Martian skies to the surface in 6 12 minutes, traveling a mere 5 mph (8 kph) by the time it lands.The stationary probe, launched in May from California, will then pause for 16 minutes for the dust to settle, literally, around its landing site, before disc-shaped solar panels are unfurled like wings to provide power to the spacecraft.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsThe mission control team at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles hopes to receive real-time confirmation of the craft\u0027s arrival from data relayed by a pair of miniature satellites that were launched along with InSight and will be flying past Mars.The JPL controllers also expect to receive a photograph of the probe\u0027s new surroundings on the flat, smooth Martian plain close to the planet\u0027s equator called the Elysium Planitia.The site is roughly 373 miles (600 km) from the 2012 landing spot of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity, the last spacecraft sent to the Red Planet by NASA.The smaller, 880-pound (360 kg) InSight - its name is short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - marks the 21st U.S.-launched Mars missions, dating back to the Mariner fly-bys of the 1960s. Nearly two dozen other Mars missions have been sent from other nations.InSight will spend 24 months - about one Martian year - using seismic monitoring and underground temperature readings to unlock mysteries about how Mars formed and, by extension, the origins of the Earth and other rocky planets of the inner solar system.While Earth\u0027s tectonics and other forces have erased most evidence of its early history, much of Mars - about one-third the size of Earth - is believed to have remained largely static, creating a geologic time machine for scientists.InSight\u0027s primary instrument is a French-built seismometer, designed to record the slightest vibrations from marsquakes and meteor impacts around the planet. The device, to be placed on the surface by the lander\u0027s robot arm, is so sensitive it can measure a seismic wave just one half the radius of a hydrogen atom.Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes during the mission, producing data to help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet\u0027s core, the rocky mantle surrounding it, and the outermost layer, the crust.The NASA Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, too, but they were bolted to the top of the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.Apollo missions to the moon brought seismometers to the lunar surface as well. But InSight is expected to yield the first meaningful data on planetary seismic tremors beyond Earth.InSight also is fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat flowing from inside the planet.Meanwhile, a radio transmitter will send back signals tracking Mars\u0027 subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet\u0027s core and possibly whether it remains molten.NASA officials say it will take two to three months for the main instruments to be deployed and put into operation.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It includes a new free trade area with no tariffs, fees, quantitative restrictions or rules of origin checks\u0026mdashan unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has.At the same time, we will be free to strike our own trade deals around the world \u0026ndash providing even greater opportunity to Scottish exporters. I welcome the strong support which employers have given to the deal and the certainty which it provides.British Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: )Crucially, the deal also ensures that we will leave EU programmes that do not work in our interests. So we will be out of the common agricultural policy, which has failed our farmers, and out of the common fisheries policy, which has so tragically failed Scotland\u0026rsquos coastal communities.At long last, we will be an independent coastal state again \u0026ndash taking back full sovereign control over our waters, and free to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in our waters.The EU maintained throughout the negotiation process that it wanted to link overall access to markets to access to fisheries.It failed in the withdrawal agreement and it failed again in the political declaration.I have been robust in defending the interests of Scottish fisherman so far and I will always be so.Mrs May will argue that her deal will a free trade area for goods with no tariffs, fees or charges that will benefit British firms.She will also say that the deal delivers for Scottish fishermen by taking back control of our waters.

This deal delivers on both of those.Mrs May was braced for a further backlash from Tory Eurosceptics today when the Treasury publishes an economic analysis of the potential costs and benefits of Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal in comparision with staying in the EU or leaving without a deal.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said: \u0026ldquoThe reputation of government economics is in the gutter.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451030531.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"get on with brexit corbyn government","story":"Well, it has been a very interesting week.The British people — asthey needed further confirmation after what has gone on over the past few months — have been let down by the political class and the establishment elite.The Tories are torn apart by ideology.The party’s historically masterful, pragmatic ability to compromise has disappeared on the one hand and naked political ambition is very evident on the other.Labour has shown total disregard for everyone. Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In our view, the plane was not airworthy.Preliminary data transmitted by flight  now suggests the troubled plane dropped at incredible speed — falling from an altitude of m in just  seconds.A normal descent for an airliner would be about m to m per minute, aviation safety expert John Cox told Bloomberg.Data obtained by FlightRadar shows the Lion Air flight JT- descending at more than m per minute.“This thing really comes unglued,” said Mr Cox, who runs consulting company Safety Operating Systems.“The numbers are barely believable.”An analysis of data from the crashed plane by the Aviation Safety website described its speed and altitude during its  minutes of flying as “erratic”.The plane made a climbing left-hand turn after take-off, climbed to m and then dropped down to m.It then climbed again and continued unsteadily for a few minutes between m and m before the fatal plunge.The Boeing  Max involved in yesterday’s crash had flown a dferent route on Sunday.Similar data shows it had erratic movements immediately after takeoff, but managed to climb and maintain a steady altitude.Lion Air has confirmed the aircraft had a “technical problem” on the Sunday flight, “which had been resolved according to the procedure”.What caused the strange changes in altitude and speed, and why the pilot asked toto Jakarta moments after takeoff, will now be a major focus for investigators.According to aviation consultant and former pilot Alastair Rosenschein, we won’t have a definitive answer on what caused the crash until authorities recover the plane’s black box.“It is almost impossible to say just what happened,” Mr Rosenschein told CNN. “At this point, some sort of mechanical failure is probably the most likely, but this is purely speculative.”The aviation expert said that until the black box is found, it would remain unlikely authorities could figure out what brought down the plane.He noted it’s especially important to find the black box quickly because the doomed plane was a newer model.“What happened here could possibly affect the same model of aircraft flying in other parts of the world,” he said.Investigators have deployed underwater beacons to trace the flight’s black box recorders, but so far they are yet to make a discovery.The top priority will be finding the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder to help determine the cause, safety experts said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452363739.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wasp discovered amazon spider zombies","story":"The nightmare bug turns spiders into helpless drones who abandon their own colonies to do the wasps bidding - before its larvae eats them alive.The gruesome discovery - made in Ecuador - was made by scientists from the University of British Columbia in Canada.They say the wasps behaviour is a particularly hardcore form of hijacking - which is when one animal manipulates another.After leaving their homes, the spiders are made to spin a special cocoon for the wasp larvae which will then hatch and eat the spider.Wasps manipulating the behaviour of spiders has been observed before, but not at a level as complex as this, said Philippe Fernandez-Fournier of the UBCs department of zoology.Not only is this wasp targeting a social species of spider but it’s making it leave its colony, which it rarely does.The parasitic wasp targets a spider called Anelosimus eximius known for living in large colonies and cooperating with others to capture prey and raise their young.Researchers noticed some of the spiders were infected with a parasitic larva and were seen wandering away from their colonies to spin enclosed webs.It was very odd because they don’t normally do that, so I started taking notes, said Fernandez-Fournier.It was then the stunned scientists noticed the larvae belonged to a unknown species of Zatypota wasp.These wasps are very elegant looking and graceful, said Samantha Straus, co-author of the study and PhD student in OBC’s department of zoology. But then they do the most brutal thing.A female wasp first lays an egg on a spider’s abdomen which then hatches and starts feeding off the spider.Then the spider deserts its colony and to create a cocoon for the larva - before waiting to be devoured the wasps young.This behaviour modication is so hardcore, Straus said.The wasp completely hijacks the spider’s behaviour and brain and makes it do something it would never do, like leave its nest and spinning a completely dferent structure.That’s very dangerous for these tiny spiders.Its not known how the wasps do this, but scientists believe it may be caused by an injection of hormones that make the spider think its in a dferent le-stage or cause it to disperse from the colonyWe think the wasps are targeting these social spiders because it provides a large, stable host colony and food source, Straus said.We also found that the larger the spider colony, the more likely it was that these wasps would target it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But No  has warned that the PM will not ditch the deal — and will keep pushing it through Parliament until it passes.One Cabinet minister branded No’s refusal to change course in the face of overwhelming odds as “extraordinary”, adding: “There is zero chance the deal will pass now”.And a former minister – who is remaining loyal to Mrs May - has calculated that the Government will lose by a devastating  votes.The senior Tory warned of “a bandwagon effect” that is pushing an ever larger coalition of Brexiteer and Remainer MPs to side against Mrs May for a myriad dferent reasons, dubbing it “madness”.Another Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Theresa is still being told she can win this by the people around her in No.“It’s terrible advice and she deserves better, because they are going to bring her down.”By Tuesday night, a total of  Tory MPs had publicly declared their opposition to the deal - struck in Brussels on Sunday after  months of torturous negotiation - with more known to also oppose it.Mrs May was dealt a fresh hammer blow when loyal former Cabinet minister Sir Michael Fallon branded it “doomed”.Given that her deal is most likely dead, our politicians must start properly planning for a clean break from the EU to ensure minimal disruption.Evidently, the bloc is unwilling to compromise.Spain have already threatened us over Gibraltar and the French with fishing.The Government should prepare to call a national emergency to ensure we are ready in four months,necessary, to leave on our own terms.It is not good enough for the PM to plough on with her bad deal, blindly believing that she will get it through Parliament. The odds are stacked against her.The Government must pull its finger out and prepare for a No Deal scenario.The ex-Defence Secretary - forced to resign a year ago for sexual inappropriateness - stunned No by dubbing the agreement “the worst of all worlds”.Sir Michael also became the first senior Tory to call for a delay to Brexit on March  next year so negotiations for a better deal can be extended.Ministers have begun privately working on options for a Plan B within their own factions, but there is no agreement among them on what it should be yet.Tory whips are instead warning backbench MPs that the PM will refuse to abandon her deal evenMPs do vote it down on December .No will instead plan to put it to Parliament a second and even a THIRD time until it passes.One MP said: “They’re trying to bring it back at least twice - possibly a third time – after renegotiations.“I think she needs to be gone after the first time it falls, but they’re trying to keep her in position.”On another tense day in British politics:Mrs May began her frantic nationwide tour of the UK on Tuesday with visits to Wales and Northern Ireland to try to sell her Brexit deal to the country ahead of the showdown vote.She will also go to Scotland on Wednesday to insist the agreement delivers for fishermen by taking back control of the UK’s waters.But ahead of the PM’s arrival in Belfast, DUP chief Ms Foster said her visit would be “a waste of time” as she won’t reopen the agreement for an Irish backstop that sees dferent regulations for Ulster and the rest of the UK.Hitting back, Mrs May insisted the deal “protects” the UK, adding: “A very clear message that we have got here in Northern Ireland but where as well is that people do not want toto uncertainty and ision”.Cabinet ministers remained loyal in public today.Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted MPs “should vote for the deal” saying it wasn’t “just the Government’s position - it’s the right thing to do”.Askedhe could guarantee that no-one would diethere was a no-deal Brexit, Mr Hancock told the Commons Health Committee: “As my permanent secretary tells me, we shouldn’t use words like guarantee.“What we can say is that we are confident thateverybody does what they need to do then there will be the continuity of supply.”Brexiteers last night warned that the Treasury’s analysis of the deal should be discarded as “yet more Project Fear”.The Sun can reveal that four dferent scenarios will be modelled against a baseline of staying in the EU, and all four are expected to show growth will be lost because of the decision to leave.They are the PM’s Chequers plan to align regulations on goods with the EU, membership of the EEA, a looser Canada-style free trade deal and no deal at all.Leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker said: “The reputation of government economics is in the gutter. That must change.“It’s time for the Chancellor to publish all his assumptions and full model documentation so we can begin the process of recovery.”Meanwhile Home Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday night admitted there was “no guarantee” the UK would be given access to two critical EU-wide crime databases.He admitted the Political Declaration only laid out plans to cooperate on finding “approximate measures” to cooperate on crime fighting.Currently police chiefs can access the Schengen Information Systemand ECRIS, the European Criminal Records Information System to check suspects against a list of third country nationals.Police accesses SISII more than  million times last year.Mr Javid told MPs: “Within this document [the Political Declaration] it’s within scope but it’s not guaranteed.”The Home Secretary insisted “almost of all my counterparts” in the EU want to cooperate on security in “much the same way”.But Labour’s Stephen Doughty revealed the PM’s chief of staff admitted  to opposition MPs at a private briefing on Monday night it would be “very dficult” to maintain access to SISII.Mr Doughty said: “Gavin Barwell told us it’s going to be an even bigger challenge to stay connected to SISII than it was to join it in the first place.”Ministers are also on course for a fresh showdown with the House of Commons when it emerged Downing Street will not publish the full Brexit legal advice – giving MPs “full, reasoned position statement” instead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

sweeping generalisations and is often criticised for inaccuracies, even outright hoods.How then should we react to the leader of the free world claiming the UK’s withdrawal agreement with the EU could mean that we would be “unable to trade” with the US This is a classic example of the need to take Donald Trump seriously, but not literally.There are no imaginable circumstances in which Britain will be blocked from trading with America.We can do so at present, even as full members of the EU.If we couldn’t, I must have imagined visiting the States and buying their products.Trade happens and will continue to do so, whatever arrangements the UK finally finds itself in.But President Trump’s intervention speaks to a deeper, more subtle truth.If the UK effectively remains in an EU customs union and without control over our regulatory system then it’s dficult to see how trade with the US will accelerate and flourish.The same goes with the rest of the non-EU world.The dficulty with Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement is that it substantially limits the capacity for the UK to strike its own trade deals.Indeed, it would make such deals almost impossible.Downing Street has hit back at this by pointing to wording in the agreement that states the UK will be entitled to reach arrangements with other countries.But this amounts to little more than a theoretical possibility given it is not made clear when,ever, we will finally be out of this “customs territory”.To grasp this problem, it is important to understand how trade negotiations work.Let’s say you and I sit round a table and go through all the things hindering trade between our two nations.Perhaps I am applying high tarfs on your wine and you are applying exorbitant tarfs on my cars.We negotiate, so more of my countrymen can drink your wine, and more of your citizens can drive my cars.To reach such accords, you need to be in full control of your own customs arrangements.If my starting point is that I can’t reduce the tarf on your wine because I’m locked into an agreement with the EU that fixes the tarf, my negotiations with you are unlikely to get off the ground.American wine, for instance, is subject to a tarf of either .p or p per ­bottle, depending on strength.A bottle of Jack Daniel’s is hit by a  per cent import tarf to the EU, while American cars are subject to a ten per cent import tarf.Meanwhile, the EU recently announced a plan to hit American motorcycles, such as Harley-Davidsons with a  per cent tarf — hugely pushing up the price.A larger part of the negotiation tends to focus on regulatory barriers to trade.Although tarfs on products mean higher prices in the shops, they do not necessarily prevent foreign prod­­ucts getting to the market.But dferences in regulation can have just this effect.If, to oversimply, all of your nails need, by law, to be in long and all of the nails in my country need to be in long, we won’t see much trade in nails between us — evenno tarfs are imposed.To improve our trading relations we need to look at whether we can agree to align some of our regulations, repeal some or respect each other’s regulatory standards.If we do not control our rules and cannot alter or abolish them, negotiations are pretty pointless.And not just with the US, but with other major economies, such as Australia and Japan.The UK faces a classic trade- off here.If what you prioritise above all  is to minimise any friction in trade between the UK and the EU, you will want to stay highly aligned with the EU’s regulations — and you may well conclude that it is easier to simply stay in the EU itself.In that case, you will also probably want the UK to join the euro, because having a dferent currency to France and Germany adds costs to our trade with them.Butyou are looking to the rest of the world, you may feel we should be able to strike a simple but comprehensive free trade deal with the EU.Trade across the Channel might not be as seamless as at present, but we would be free to strike deals to improve trade across the Atlantic and the Pacic.If Mrs May’s is the deal we are left with, those hoping for a global Britain post-Brexit will be deeply disappointed.Even a no-deal scenario would at least unshackle the UK from EU rules and provide more autonomy over our future trading relationships with the rest of the world.Trade with the EU is important to the UK, but it is declining.Over the next decade,  per cent of all global economic growth is predicted to come from outside the European Union.If you see Brexit as a historic opportunity

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Philip Hammond sounded the warning as damning legal advice on the Prime Ministers deal is published later today. The comments - almost unheard of from a Tory Cabinet minister - are bound to prompt fresh calls to cancel Brexit. They come as a poll shows % would choose to Remain in a second EU referendum - compared to % who would pick Theresa Mays deal, and % backing No Deal. The Prime Minister has launched a two-week campaign to save her deal ahead of a vote by MPs on December . She is trying to convince a coalition of Brexiteer and Remainer rebels, including almost  Tories, to change their minds and back her.   To convince MPs, Theresa May has repeatedly boasted there will be a Brexit idend to spend on the NHS. But the Chancellor told BBC Breakfast: If the only consideration, the only consideration, was the economy, then the analysis shows clearly remaining in the European Union would be a better outcome for the economy, but not by much. He could only say the Prime Ministers deal will put the UK very close to the economic benefits of remaining in - rather than being better than Remaining. And he admitted: Remaining in the single market would give us an economic advantage, yes. Parts of the governments Brexit economic analysis has been leaked to the Dailyahead of its publication today. According to the reports, Treasury forecasts show that Britain will be poundbn worse off under a no-deal Brexit.   Its expected to show that under the Chequers agreement, which forms the basis of Mays deal, the UKs GDP will be between  and % lower over  years thanit had stayed in the EU. Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted there would only be a modest impact from a Brexit with a deal. But in No Deal he admitted food prices could soar. If theres no deal it is quite likely there would be a negative impact on food prices, he told Sky News. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here.  We import a lot of food including a lot of food from the EU. In a no deal scenario we could expect the cost of that to increase. Ian Murray, Labour MP and backer of anti-Brexit campaign Best For Britain, said: Behind these figures are peoples livelihoods, with workers losing their jobs and businesses scaling back. Rather than producing figures to try and show that her deal is not as bad as no deal, the government should be focused on the best way to grow our economy - by giving voters the opportunity to remain in the EU.

Parliament won the right to see the full legal advice and that is precisely what we expect to see. Labour will not let ministers off the hook.

Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. Under the ministerial code it quite clearly states that the Attorney Generals opinion must be sought on critical legal decision in good time, he said. And that being available to the Cabinet, I dont really see why it shouldnt be available to the people and to Parliament. Meanwhile Sajid Javid yesterday refused to confirm an immigration paper will be published before MPs vote on the Brexit deal on December . He was only able to say he hoped it would be released in time. Theresa May is widely expected to lose the House of Commons vote on her blindfold deal after more than  Tory or DUP MPs indicated they will vote against it.

Little Ella Bryson was distressed and tearful when she was found all alone by a fellow holidaymaker - and is still traumatised by the ordeal. Her furious parents Billy and Claire fear the worst could have happenedit wasnt for the kind stranger. And they claim the organisers of the kids club didnt even realise she was missing. Dad Billy, , from Angus, Scotland, said: Somebody could have grabbed her on the beach or she could have gone into the water and drowned. If somebody had picked her up, how were security going to know that she wasn’t just crying for her mum ” The family were on holiday at the Sahara Beach AquaPark Resort, near the city of Monastir, with their other kids, Ruby, nine, and Billie, four.  Ellas parents, who booked their holiday through Thomas Cook, had dropped her off in the kids club run by the hotel as opposed to the travel firm. About  minutes later, a fellow holidaymaker brought a distressed Ella back to Billy – having found her wandering alone on a nearby beach. Mum Claire, , said her daughter was in such a state when she was ed to her - commenting on how she was red and shaking. “It’s a parent’s worst nightmare,” said Claire.  “The nightmares I’ve been having since have been terrible. This is something none of us should have had to deal with.” Billy said he complained to a rep about what happened, only to be told the rep wasnt even aware of the incident. He said: When I went back to tell her that my daughter had been brought back to us, she wasn’t even aware that she was missing. She had no clue where my daughter was. “She was saying, ‘oh my God, I’m so sorry’. I said, ‘sorry  I could have never seen my daughter again – she’s two. You’re supposed to be the adult – how could you let my two-year-old daughter vanish ’ He added: “You always think about the worst that could happen.

Dad Billy said Ella, now three, grips onto his hand as tight as she can while theyre out in public, and climbs on him to be carried. He said before, she was never like that.  He added: “Even now,we go to Asda, she’s holding your hand as tight as she can or she’s climbing to get up or she’s wanting to sit in the trolley.” The family met the guest who found Ella at a disco. Billy said: “We can’t thank her enough.” Meanwhile, in a post on social media directed at Thomas Cook, Claire strongly criticised the company – threatening the firm with legal action and vowing never to travel with it or go to the resort again.  She wrote: What did Ella have to do  Be kidnapped or drown or something for them to take it seriously ” A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: “Customer safety is our first priority, so we were very concerned to hear of this incident and we understand how distressing it must have been. “We are urgently investigating with the hotel to get to the bottom of what happened and make any changes needed.” The Sahara Beach AquaPark was contacted for comment.

John Kinsella, , was shot four times by a masked cyclist while walking his dogs with Wendy Owen in St Helens. Prosecutors saya gangland feud lay behind his killing, and that of Salfords Mr Big Paul Massey, almost three years earlier. Liverpool Crown Court heard the two friends were caught up in a war between rival gangs, which pitted them against Mark Fellows and Steven Boyle - who are both accused of murdering the pair, reports the Liverpool Echo. The court heard Miss Owen was also shot at when an assassin struck on a country lane near the couples Rainhill home.   A video of her interview with police - just hours after the shooting at around .am on May  this year- was today played in court. They were walking six bulldogs along their usual route when Miss Owen said she heard the braking wheels of a mountain bike. She recalled hearing a puff noise, plus a shout or a raised voice, and initially thinking the cyclist wanted them to put their dogs on a lead. Miss Owen demonstrated how Kinsella staggered, assomething got him in the leg, and said she thought: Oh my God, he’s shooting at us. She said she screamed and approached the gunman, who turned to shoot at her. She said: I remember thinking he’s not stopping. Miss Owen said she ducked, then jumped over a fence to escape, shouted for help and flagged down a van on the M junction  slip road. Miss Owen said nothing was said by the shooter, or Kinsella, adding: I think he was in shock because he was getting attacked. She described looking back over the bushes and seeing the gunman move closer to Kinsella, then shoot him as he lay on the ground. Miss Owen said the weapon, which an officer told her may have been equipped with a silencer, sounded like a pellet gun.  The witness said the gunman was cool and only interested in her after she confronted him, before he ed to Kinsella. She said: He’s just gone forward again. As I’m replaying it in my mind, speaking about it, he’s wanted to keep, it’s like he wanted to finish the job. I know this sounds silly, but think of films, when they want to keep, it was like in a film when he wanted to finish the job and go. I thought bloody hell it’s like a film, he wants to finish what he’s doing. The jury heard a statement from a workman, who with a colleague found hysterical Miss Owen, then tried to help Kinsella. A police officer also spoke to her when she later ed to the scene in her Mercedes, after dropping off her bulldogs at home. He said: When questioned she said John was not in dispute with anyone or involved in drug supply. He bought and sold cars. [She said] he had been in prison about five years ago but was now behaving, as he didn’t want to go back there. She said he did have previous for armed robbery. The officer said he was later tasked with going to Miss Owens home to tell her Kinsella was dead. He said she came outside and said he’s dead, he’s dead isn’t he , to which he replied yes.  Miss Owen, who gave birth on Sunday, will be cross-examined later in the trial, via video link from a remote location. Firearms expert Andre Horn told the court Kinsella was shot twice from behind in the back, then twice in the back of the head. He said one round entered his lower back and exited through his chest, suggesting he was leaning forward, trying to dodge the bullet. Mr Horn said one went through his spine, so he would have collapsed, and three rounds were left lodged in his abdomen and head. He said the bullets indicated the assassin used a British-manufactured Webley revolver, which was last in service in the s. However, the expert said he did not find any of the bullets in the vast field which Miss Owens said were fired at her.

The little royal was part of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussexs wedding party, but the preparations were reportedly dficult for her mum. Two separate sources told theKate was feeling quite emotional at the fitting, which took place shortly after she gave birth to Prince Louis. The report comes amid rumours of a rt between the two duchesses, which has been further fueled by news Meghan and Harry will no longer be moving into an apartment next door to Kate and William.  They will move to the stunning Frogmore Cottage in Windsor instead, which will undergo a huge refurbishment before they move in. However it is not known why Kate got upset during the dress fitting, andit had anything to do with her sister-in-law. Kensington Palace declined to comment. Kate didnt have an official role in the wedding, but she was tasked with helping lead the young bridal party up the steps of St Georges Chapel and into the church.  The Duchesses have attended a number of events together, and they went to watch Serena Williams take on Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon womens final in the summer. Earlier this week the Sunday Mirror revealed there are a number of reasons why Harry and Meghan have to move to Windsor. They chose it over Apartment  - next door to William, , and Kate and their three children - because of the multi-million pound cost of the refit that would be required for the flat, which is currently occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, it is claimed.  Another reason is Harry craves more privacy and doesnt want his family to be as visible as the Cambridges, whose home and the surrounding gardens are a major tourist and paparazzi attraction. Kate and William also left London shortly after their marriage, moving to Anglesey for the Dukes job. Princess Charlotte was one of six child bridesmaids at Meghans wedding, and her big brother Prince George was a pageboy.

Buck, a -month-old Labrador, suffers from megaesophagus - which means he cannot eat food without being sick unless he is held in an upright position. So university boffins and an animal charity teamed up to create the unique contraption which holds the pooch in place so he can get down enough food. Buck currently weights just half of what he should and might have starved to death and not made it beyond his second birthdaythe high chair hadnt been invented. Buck was taken in by the charity Team Edward Labrador Rescue before his story was spotted by University of Nottingham vet and teaching associate, Emma Drinkall. Along with her partner Nick Rowan, a senior lecturer in product design and engineering at De Montford University, the couple designed and built the chair in just a day. The high chair has been designed so that Emma and Nick can continue to adapt it as Buck hopefully piles on the pounds. Buck has not regurgitated since using the chair and his carers have put him on a high calorie puppy food diet to help him improve his strength. Emma, from the University of Nottingham’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, said: “We saw the Buck’s story on social media, and I knew we just had to do somethinghe was going to have a chance. Luckily Nick and I have the combined expertise and experience to build the chair quickly. Heartwarming moment chimp saved from poachers hugs rescuer before being released There is currently no surgery available for dogs with this condition, and as Buck is already receiving the medications that can help, the one thing other thing that could help him keep his food down is gravity itself. Being upright while feeding will help the food drip through the sphincter that controls access to his stomach. Dogs with megaoesophagus are at risk of developing very serious chest infections which can prove fatal, because they can accidentally breathe in food particles when they regurgitate their food. We hope that by feeding Buck this way and stopping him from regurgitating we will minimise the risk of this additional complication developing. Wendy, Team Edward Labrador Rescue, David Bucks’ foster Dad, and Laura Buck’s Vet have all done an amazing job with Buck so far.” Nick said: “I’m just so pleased with how it fits, how comfortably he sits in it and how happy he is to be fed like this. He is the same width in his shoulders as our own  kilo Jack Russell, so without meeting Buck ourselves, we had to double check his measurements during the build – it just didn’t seem right for a big dog like a Labrador.” Cheeky dog caught sipping owners pint outside pub after checking coast is clearVet Laura Pearce, from the Lawrence Veterinary Centre in Eastwood, Notts., has been Buck’s vet since he was rescued by the charity. She said: “I am actually surprised that Buck has lived as long as he has with this condition. His oesophagus is abnormal in that it’s enlarged and has lost its tube-like state that pushes food through to the stomach. It means little of the food he eats actually makes it into his stomach for digestion, most gets stuck in pouches in the oesophagus or is regurgitated again.” Skeletal dog dumped by side of busy road was hours from deathBuck weighed only kg when he was taken in by the charity Team Edward Labrador Rescue which are based in Mansfield, Notts. Wendy Hopewell, who runs Team Edward, said: We were really shocked. The previous owner said they were really struggling to feed him but when I saw him I thought wow, Ive never seen a Labrador that thin before “It was just the most fabulous sight to see Buck eating in the chair and happy to be in it. To see how he sat in it straight away and get stuck in was incredible, it just pulls at your heartstrings.” "},{"url":null,"title":"single mums tell how universal","story":"NewsSingle mums tell how Universal Credit has plunged them into debtFour women have taken their fight over means-tested benefits to the High CourtShareByAmy-Clare Martin:,  NOV NewsFour women have taken their Universal Credit fight to the High Court \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSingle working mums fighting the Universal Credit chaos have told how the benefits shake-up has plunged them into debt and forced them to use foodbanks to feed their children.

The fourth, occupational therapist Claire Woods, had to put her career on hold, went into debt and was forced to use a foodbank. She added: “I wanted to become free of welfare through my chosen profession but UC is holding me back from that.” The four are calling for a change in the “irrational and discriminatory” system. Solicitor Tessa Gregory, for Ms Johnson, said once UC is fully rolled out the issue will hit “tens of thousands,not more.” The Child Poverty Action Group’s lawyer Carla Clarke, representing the other women, called it “an injustice to hard-working parents”. Edward Brown, for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, said larger employers could change pay systems to suit UC. The DWP said claimants missing out one month “may” get more the next month.

The clip begins with protesters quietly walking into the restaurant whilst unsuspecting customers are eating their steaks. The person filming the video - who is a vegan - can be heard saying: “This smells horrible, look at all the flesh.” But as a spokeswoman attempts to give a speech about the benefits of veganism, patrons can be heard jeering and one mimics a cow mooing whilst waiters can be seen arguing with the protestors.

A tiny wire connector in this Hotpoint fridge-freezer relay compressor is likely to have overheated in flat  on the fourth floor, the blaze inquiry was told. Electrical fire expert Dr John Glover highlighted “poor crimp connection”, which made the wires unsafe by failing to keep them tightly gripped. He said: “The overheating of the crimp starts the fire. It overheats, it glows, it ignites.” The inquiry previously heard that shyflat owner Behailu Kebede saw that smoke “seemed to be coming from his Hotpoint fridge-freezer”, calling  at .am. The blaze, on June , , spread quickly across the  floors of the West London tower block, killing .  Cabbie Mr Kebede, then , was one of three living in the flat. He banged on neighbours’ doors and waited for them to leave before fleeing himself, the hearing was told in the summer. The tower’s external cladding, feared to have fuelled the fire, is now banned. Investigators recovered the evidence from a small relay compressor compartment at the fridge-freezer’s bottom rear. The inquiry heard three inches of damaged wire found in one of the bedrooms  days later probably came from the same compartment. Dr Glover, engineer atshy shyinvestigators Failure Electrical, said poor crimping showed up in CT scans. “I found voids in  cross-sections indicating the crimp was not nice and tight.”  In a report for the inquiry Dr Glover concluded: “The overheating connector in my opinion was the first event that started burning the insulation on the wires that led to a short circuit.” This year, consumers were advised to carry on using the Hotpoint FFB after it was assessed as posing a “low risk” in an independent investigation.

When police arrested him he was carrying a wooden catapult, binoculars and tree climbing “crampon-style” boots. He told officers: Ive been a silly man, havent I  A search of his home revealed over , eggs from rare birds including nightingales, woodlarks and kingfishers.  Chairman of the bench Darren Gilkes sentenced Lingham to  weeks in jail. Describing the defendants egg collecting obsession, Mr Gilkes said: “That is damaging for the whole community. They [the eggs] can never be recovered.” Norwich Magistrates Court heard that Lingham took the eggs from up to  locations across Norfolk. He was arrested by officers at Cawston Heath SSSI in May this year.  Officers found nine linnet eggs he said he had picked up from the ground. The rest of the eggs were discovered stashed in boxes throughout his home in Newton St Faith, Norfolk. The eggs were from  dferent birds,  of which were classed as “schedule one species”, meaning they were highly endangered. Prosecutor Colette Harper told magistrates the eggs could have been taken from up to  locations across Norfolk. At an earlier hearing, Lingham admitted five offences under the Wildle and Countryside Act. The court heard he was convicted of similar offences in  when he was sentenced to  weeks in prison for illegally collecting more than , eggs.  Mrs Harper described the egg collecting as “totally unnecessary and damaging”, causing “not only local but regional decline”. James Burrows, defending, said Lingham had been treated for his “obsessive compulsive disorder”, which was driving “an addiction to collecting wild bird eggs”. Mr Burrows said his client had “a dficult relation” with his father as a boy, adding: “The only way his father would give him praise washe collected rare eggs. “It has somewhat snowballed from there over all these years.”  Lingham was also handed a -year Criminal Behaviour Order banning him from committing similar crimes in the future. Mr Gilkes warned : “If you break this CBO, you could be put in custody for five years.” Mr Gilkes ordered the destruction of the catapult, binoculars and tree climbing boots. The court also heard the eggs would be given to the Natural History Museum.

Pregnancy tests had shown she was not expecting and she thought she was just piling on weight. Baffled about why her bump kept on growing, she made repeated visits to her doctor. But after more pregnancy tests came back negative her GP, still convinced a baby was the only explanation, referred her for an ultrasound scan. And it was then that her enormous bump was revealed to be an oian cyst weighing more than four stone – the same weight as seven newborn babies. Keely, , had a five-hour op to remove the growth – which she nicknamed Mr Whippy – and shed a third of her body weight. She says: “I lost sight of how dficult even simple things like driving a car or walking up the stairs had become. Losing my lump gave me my le back.” Keely noticed she was gaining weight around  but thought nothing of it. “I’ve always been chunky but over a couple of years I gradually got this tummy” she says.  “I couldn’t understand it. I was exercising and eating healthily but I was slowly getting bigger. It crept up so slowly I didn’t know anything was wrong – I thought I was putting on timber.” Keely, who has been with partner Jamie Gibbins for  years, thought she could be expecting. “We did wonder a few timesI was pregnant” she says, “but we did at least three home tests and they ruled it out.” Assuming it was simple weight gain – which had made her balloon from a size  to a , weighing in at  stone – Keely carried on as normal. Then, in the summer of , she blacked out at her office admin job and decided to see her GP. “It was a tough period in work and when I passed out my GP put it down to stress,” she says. “My blood tests came back clear and when I fainted again, I was told it was probably a side effect of acne tablets I’d been prescribed. But I’d stopped taking them six months previously.  “I pointed to my belly and said, ‘Could it be anything to do with this ’” Keely, from Swansea, says her GP insisted she must be pregnant, despite blood tests ruling this out. Convinced there had been a mistake, a new blood test was requested. She says: “Anyone would have thought I was nine months gone. It wasn’t the first time I’d been mistaken for an expectant mum but my GP had the test results. “People had seen me waddling around, carrying this lump, and I’d been asked a few times when I was due. It was so embarrassing trying to explain I was – or so I thought – just fat. I’d go along with it to spare everyone’s blushes. I remember trying to shop for clothes in December  and nothing would fit. I was skin and bone on top, then this massive lump and normal legs. The only thing that was going to fit was maternity wear.”   She ed to her GP that month to discuss her blood test results – again negative for pregnancy. Still convinced Keely was expecting, her GP referred her for an ultrasound scan. There, Keely was presented with an ominous black screen. “By the time I had the appointment it was January last year” she says. “I had Jamie beside me as the radiologist moved the probe over my tummy. I saw her eyes widen in horror but the screen was blank. The look on her face said it all. When she said she had to get a consultant I started to panic. Jamie did his best to reassure me but I felt shyparalysed with fear.” The consultant sent Keely for an emergency CT scan – which revealed a cyst surrounded by fluid. “He told me I wasn’t fat all, I was quite thin. But I had a cm-thick sac of fluid in my belly.”  Hop on your bike or in the pool to age slower - and keep out the weights room Keely was referred to a high-risk obstetrics consultant and examined in February. “By this time, even walking was a struggle and I had dficulty breathing,” she says. “I’ll never forget the look of shock on his face when the consultant examined me. He said I had a large oian mass and the only option was surgery. He couldn’t say what it was exactly, or how big. He warned me there might be more than one and they could be attached to other organs. “Agreeing to the surgery, I felt like I was signing my le away. Until they opened me up, no one knew what they would find.” As Keely waited four weeks for surgery, her stomach swelled another in. She finally went under the kne at Swansea’s Singleton Hospital in March last year. What she hoped would be a routine hour-long op ran for five hours as her surgeon removed a cyst weighing kg – or st lb. With newborns averaging lb oz, Keely’s benign cyst weighed the same as septuplets. She said: “I remember still being groggy from the anaesthetic as they wheeled me back to the ward and excited hospital staff were shoving photos in front of me.  “I didn’t understand why until I came round and everyone was treating me like a minor celebrity. They explained how big this cyst was and showed me pictures – I couldn’t believe I’d been walking around carrying this medical alien. “It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr Whippy!” Keely has a cm scar from her sternum to her pelvis but was back on her feet soon after the op. She says: “I was sore but walking around felt amazing!” Keely lost her right oy in the surgery but medics say her odds of becoming a mum are unaffected. In the meantime, she is getting used to one unwanted side-effect of pregnancy all new mums dread. “At  and even though I’ve never been pregnant, I’ve been left with stretch marks,” she says.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration and local marines finally recaptured the -year-old crime lord, who twice escaped from prison, in his native Mexico in . But now – while El Chapo is standing trial in New York and allegations surface that he bribed Mexico City’s chief of police – authorities have discovered that another, even more powerful, kingpin was the true mastermind behind the Sinaloa cartel. It now appears that El Chapo was something of a public face, the poster boy for the world’s most feared drugs cartel. The real leader of the trafficking operation is El Chapo’s former partner, -year-old Ismael Zambada, known as El Mayo. For, despite El Chapo’s incarceration, analysts have seen an increase in the cartel’s shipments to the States, including the highly addictive, often fatal, drug fentanyl.  The bloodshed has also escalated under El Mayo’s command. Murders in Mexico rose % in the first half of this year, to ,, up from , in the same period in . Authorities have attributed the rise in deaths to battles between the rival Jalisco New Generation drugs cartel and El Mayo’s organisation, for control of trafficking routes from Mexico’s west coast to America. But while Sinaloa’s activity has escalated under El Mayo’s reign, he remains a ghost. Whereas El Chapo’s love of the limelight and lavish lestyle eventually led to his demise, El Mayo, a former poppy field worker, has stayed below the radar. He tops the DEA’s list of the world’s most wanted criminals, with a poundmillion bounty on his head, but the multibillionaire has never been in prison, despite more than  years of trafficking. Former chief of operations at the DEA, Jack Riley, who captured El Chapo, says he has no doubt who Sinaloa’s real boss is. He says: “Mayo is the most powerful drug trafficker. I even think we have underestimated his influence and power in controlling the US drug market.”  Thousands of Mexican marines, police and DEA agents – all supported by drones and high-tech surveillance – have searched for El Mayo for more than  decades. But he is still the most elusive fugitive on the planet. To evade capture, he has had plastic surgery, wears a range of disguises, and never sleeps in the same place twice. He remains in constant movement, especially in the mountainous region shared by the states of Durango, Sinaloa and Chihuahua, in northwest Mexico. The area is known as the Golden Triangle, thanks to its abundance of poppies and marijuana. But the biggest weapons in El Mayo’s evasion arsenal are the hundreds of officials he pays off. They, according to El Chapo’s defence team, stretch to the very highest office in Mexico, with El Mayo allegedly paying pound.million to President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has denied the allegation. El Chapo’s defence lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, told jurors: “He’s [Guzman] blamed for being the leader, while the real leaders are living freely and openly in Mexico.”In truth, he controlled nothing. Mayo Zambada did. Mayo Zambada kept paying the Mexican government, president after president, two in a row – and somehow he remains free. And who is the one that’s constantly being hunted down  It’s Guzman.   “[Government officials] were paid off to leave Zambada alone.” Former Mexican president Felipe Calderon, who preceded Neito, has always denied taking cartel money. El Mayo started working with a cartel based in Juarez, on the Mexico-US border, in the s and s. When Juarez’s leader, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, died in  after botched plastic surgery to change his face, the cartel eventually split into two factions. One gang was based in Tijuana, on the US border, and the other, set up largely by El Mayo and El Chapo, was in Sinaloa, further south. When the Tijuana cartel began to decline, and the pair took advantage. They set out to expand their trafficking routes to the US and Europe, as they controlled much of the heroin production and shipment in Mexico. The Sinaloa cartel went on to build a poundbillion-a-year international cocaine, heroin and human-trafficking empire. El Mayo’s strength was his ability to quickly adapt to customers’ demands.   And, as the cash poured in, his army of highly educated money men laundered their ill-gotten gains through some of the world’s biggest banks and offshore accounts, while also investing in legitimate companies. Mike Vigil, former head of international operations at the DEA, explained: “He has a very ersied portfolio. Even though he’s only had maybe an elementary school education, he’s received a Hard-level education from some of the most prolic, knowledgeable and astute drug lords that Mexico has ever had.” Now, despite his advancing years, growing frailty, and battle with diabetes, EL Mayo is as sharp as ever. Since El Chapo’s arrest in January , he has successfully ersied the cartel’s business, from cannabis and coke to deadly fentanyl, an opioid-based synthetic drug. The average revenue from one kilo of fentanyl purchased in China can yield as much as  times the income of one kilo of heroin bought in Colombia, according to the DEA. And now, with America in the grip of an opioid crisis, the Sinaloa cartel’s supply shows no sign of slowing.   According to US agencies, El Mayo tends to act more as an entrepreneur than as a drug lord. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States says he has been in charge of many financial operations within the Sinaloa cartel. And he uses his considerable resources to pay for protection from the authorities, and within the mountain communities where he hides out. Indeed, El Mayo has often become a patron and protector of locals in the area. Unlike other drug barons, he is not known for targeting civilians. This – and the fact that his businesses offer them employment, security and health care services not covered by local authorities – has allowed him to build an impenetrable protection network. Francisco Jimenez Reynoso, a researcher at the University of Guadalajara, says: “They buy wills, they buy loyalties and, in many cases, they are willing to give up their lives for a character of this nature, eventhey engage in illicit activities.”  Despite his low-key, almost gentle, persona, El Mayo is not a man to be crossed. Protected by dozens of henchmen, he has stayed at the top despite huge blows to his inner circle. In recent years, two of his sons and a nephew have been captured. But his most signicant loss was his bother, Jesus Zambada, who was arrested in  and is now helping the US’s case against El Chapo. After seeking a deal with US prosecutors, Jesus – the cartel’s chief accountant for more than  years – said his brother and El Chapo were considered Sinaloa’s leaders. El Mayo also lost his right-hand man, Manuel Torres Felix, in a shootout with the military in . Five years later, El Mayo survived an attack, reportedly by Damaso Lopez Nunez, another Sinaloa leader. A slew of deaths followed the assassination attempt. The ambush also targeted two of El Chapo’s sons, suggesting an internal power struggle after his capture in Mexico in , and his extradition to the US a year later. Some analysts had believed El Mayo might be slipping into the shadows, or even retiring, but instead, since El Chapo’s capture, he seems to be relishing his sole command.

The devout Christian said he embarked on the project to prove that God exists, and said he believes every word of the Bible. He told JTA: This is a copy of God’s ship. It only makes sense to take it to God’s land.”   He had planned to take his ark to Israel soon after it was built, but wildfires meant he had to postpone the idea. Huibers described Israel as Gods land, and believes it is a fitting place for the massive boat to sail to. He said he got the idea to build his own version of Noahs Ark more than  years ago when he was reading the Bible story to his children.   In  he decided to build a replica of the ark, but wasnt satisfied as it was only  feet long - half the size of the vessel in the famous text. He sold that, and decided to have a go at making something akin to the real thing, enlisting the help of volunteers, many of who had no carpentry experience. As a result, he admitted, parts of the boat are a bit crooked. In the Bible story, God chooses a righteous man named Noah to build a huge ship, on which two of every type of animal are onboard. The occupants of the ark survived when the whole world was flooded. Huibers is adament that mankind is facing a similar threat, saying: I believe we are living in the end of times. The ark hasnt been without its controversies, with devout Christians arguing it is a forbidden depiction of Gods image, according to JTA. It briefly served as a petting zoo, and has housed le-sized models of animals to show the ark is capable of carrying them.

He’s out of contract in the summer but it looks a safe bet a new one will be on the table for him.Edjenguele is also a free agent next year and, at , it’s dficult to say where he will be playing his football come the   campaign.However,it’s where, it looks likely he will have moved on after playing a part in any success that’s about to come United’s way.Out of the league team since the opening-day defeat against the Pars, he’s had to wait for his chance.It came when Frederic Frans got injured in the warm-up prior to the Queen of the South win. A clean sheet in that one and another, part in thanks to a huge performance at the heart of the defence from the Frenchman, up at Ross County saw him retain his place for Alloa even when Frans was back fit.It could still be that over the course of the season he reverts to squad player status.Several times since his arrival the manager has stressed the contribution of those coming in when others are out through injury and suspension will be vital. Evenit’s just on that level, Edjenguele has shown he can have a part to play."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfd19a75e711.jpg ","title":"free travel santas wearing red suits can get buses at no cost to dundee dash","story":"It’s the festive fundraiser spectacle of the year – and what better way to travel to it than by bus This year’s Santa Dash – in which hundreds of people dressed as Father Christmas will take to the streets to raise money for the Archie Foundation – takes place on Sunday.And transport firm Xplore is lending the event its support – offering free bus travel to anyone dressed up.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore Dundee, said: “This is a great event for a fantastic cause and we’re very happy to support it once again.“Anyone wearing the red suit will be able to get on board a bus to the city centre for free to join in the festive fun.”The Santa Dash will kick off at .am in City Square.Hundreds of participants will follow a km km route through the city centre.The second annual event is being sponsored by furniture and carpet store Gillies, with the Eveningand Wave FM also backing the dash.Funds will go towards the charity’s Tayside appeal, which has a target of raising £ million for a new children’s operating theatre suite at Tayside Children’s Hospital.Garry Smith, events and promotions officer for Leisure and Culture Dundee, said: “It’s going to be a busy weekend with people doing their Christmas shopping, so we recommend the Santas get the bus for free.“It’s just so much easier than travelling by car and having to find a parking space.”Ward Road and Commercial Street will be closed from am until pm and Xplore Dundee customers are encouraged to check the full ersion details online before travelling because some bus routes will be affected.The price of entering the dash £ for adults, £. for under-s, £. for under fives and free for kids under three.Bookings close today and can be made at Central Library, Olympia or Dundee Ice Arena before the centres close.To book online, visit leisureand culturedundee santadash before midnight tomorrow.Dashers can start fundraising with Virgin Money Giving at bit.ly qltwDY.

His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

Sheila Penny raised concerns about traffic and the Coylton Primary School roll on behalf of the Kyle and Carrick Civic Society.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

outlet in Musselburgh.The sherf also acquitted Salinger of a second alleged offence of making inappropriate comments and sexual gestures towards another woman at the same place.But the sherf told Salinger he was ldquosatisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had sexually touched the two teenagers at Seton Sands and said to think otherwise would be ldquofancul.Sherf Cook added that the offences had been ldquodeliberate sexual assaults and not accidental and that the pots and pans excuse was ldquoinherently unlikely.Sherf Cook deferred full sentence on Salinger for the preparation of social work reports and a restriction of liberty order assessment.The sherf also placed Salinger on the sex offendersrsquo register for a period still to be decided.Salinger was found guilty, following a summary trial, of sexually assaulting a teenager by seizing her by the bottom and squeezing it at Seton Sands Holiday Park on an occasion between March  and May .He was also found guilty of pressing

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value.

Having grown up in the north-east of Scotland and witnessed the decline of once-thriving fishing towns like Fraserburgh and Peterhead, it was easy to understand why. Designed to safeguard the sustainability of the seas, the CFP necessarily restricted the size of the catch local vessels could bring in, with the number of fishermen working on Scottish boats halving between the s and the late s as a result. The north-east, which accounts for around a quarter of the total Scottish workforce, bore the brunt of that decline, with Fraserburgh seeing numbers fall by  per cent while in Peterhead they dropped by  per cent.The damage this has wreaked on the local economy has been immense, with high streets that in the s were filled with bustling shops and chintzy cafes all but dead while the windows of countless private residences, once resplendent with Royal Doulton figurines, have been boarded up. With heroin addiction continuing to claim the lives of too many youngsters who at one time would have been destined for a le at sea, wouldnrsquot you too have voted to break away from the remote political institution whose desk-bound bureaucrats had caused all those ills The problem is that holding the EU ndashand the CFP in particular ndash responsible for all the problems that have befallen such communities ignores the influence of way too many other factors. Such as the fact that the licences required to operate within the rules of the CFP have been allocated by the UK and Scottish governments in such a way that large super-trawlers have been able to flourish at the expense of the smaller-scale fishermen who were once the mainstay of the fishing industry. Indeed, while there are more than , vessels licensed to fish in Scotland, in  two-thirds of the catch by weight was landed by just  super-trawlers.Or the fact that the heroin epidemic that has rendered so many in the north-east incapable of following their forbears out to sea sprang up due to an abundance, rather than lack of, wealth. Though fishermen had long been known for their hard-drinking ways when back on shore, the nineties generation began dabbling in narcotics, spending their hard-earned but plentul cash on party drugs before making the inevitable move on to heroin and addiction.And yet, as has become abundantly clear in recent weeks, while the CFP alone is not the cause of all the fishing industryrsquos ills, neither will quitting the EU be the remedy, with Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement all but spelling out that fishing rights will be up for grabs as part of EU-UK trade negotiations. This should come as no surprise given that Norway, which allows EU boats to fish in its waters infor market access, has long been held up as the fishing nation the UK should seek to emulate, but itrsquos not what the Leave campaign led the fishing industry to believe.On top of that, while ldquotaking back control of our waters will inevitably turn out to mean continuing to share control of our waters, Scottish business relationships that have built up because Norway stayed out of the single market will also suffer. Indeed, as Norway pays higher tarfs for processed products than it does for whole fish it sends much of its catch to Scotland, Denmark and Poland to be processed before the finished products make their way tarf-free into the EU. With UK-EU tarfs likely to be imposed it is hard to imagine those Scottish interests surviving the Brexit process, with scores of jobs being lost as a result.It is certainly true that the overly centralised CFP has led to many problems, with absurd amounts of waste being caused by quota-bound fisherman throwing tonnes of dead fish back into the water each year rather than breach the Brussels-set rules. And, yes, the voices of fishermen whose intimate knowledge of the seas has been passed down from generation to generation have been ignored in favour of a one-size-fits-all bureaucratic approach. But as things stand, the best our fishermen can hope for is a continuation of much of what the CFP provides for without the UK ever having a hope of being able to change it.As happened in so many other areas during the Brexit campaign, our fishing communities were sold a lie by the likes of Mr Farage. Having had their deeply held frustrations and fears exploited, surely they now deserve the right for an informed say.

This includes those near Bennachie and those through Inverurie on the existing A.”The removal of the plan to upgrade the A through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area has been welcomed by Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin.Last month, Ms Martin welcomed campaigners from the Save Bennachie group to meet with new Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss their concerns.The group also previously met with then Economy Minister Keith Brown earlier this year to discuss their opposition to the plans.Ms Martin MSP said: “I am thrilled Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has confirmed the route passing Bennachie has now been dropped.“The Save Bennachie group have tirelessly campaigned and shown true passion and dedication for their cause.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Macdonald Pittodrie House has been shortlisted for the Wedding of the Year category\"  North east hotel makes award finals viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“I commend them all for a campaign which has been time-consuming and, those who were a part of it, for their commitment and determination.“They managed to achieve cross-party support and I know MSPs from all parties shared a collective admiration for them.“I would like to thank the Transport Minister and Transport Scotland for all their work to date and for taking the time to meet with myself, other MSPs and the Save Bennachie team to listen to their views. Their hard work has paid off.”North East MSP Mike Rumbles added: \"I’m delighted that the Scottish Government has decided to remove possible routes for the A that would damage the natural environment around Bennachie.\"I have no idea why it has taken so long for the minister and Transport Scotland to make this commitment. The option to ert the dual carriageway south of Inverurie and over the foothills of Bennachie should never have been on the table in the first place.“I have met with the transport minister and local campaigners here in the Parliament on several occasions and I can categorically say that it is thanks to their tireless efforts that we are seeing this progress today.“I look forward to exploring the options that have now been put forward and I will be watching to ensure that no concessions are made that could damage our iconic landscape.”"},{"url":null,"title":"community gathers to remember mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Game of Thrones star Iain Glen may have recovered from deadly greyscale in the epic drama but hes asking his fellow Scots to own up to the inevitable and make a will. \"  \"  What do Iain Glen, Dame Judi Dench, Graham Norton and Robert Peston have in common  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“The money will be used to support other families to help them build hope for the future and to make them smile again.”Grampian Child Bereavement Network is a small charity that provides direct support to bereaved children and young people throughout the region."},{"url":null,"title":"students praised at ceremony","story":"Inverurie Academy held its Awards Ceremony on Thursday, June .

Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmA coastal flooding alert has been issued for Orkney by the Scottish Environmental Protection AgencyFloodline Service.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by .

Mossa-Rahmani said that its assets would be “better placed in the bosom” of DNO, which is Norway’s oldest independent oil and gas company.The offer comes on the back of weaker oil prices in recent weeks. The price of Brent crude has tumbled since hitting a four-year high in September, with a barrel trading at  on Monday morning.Analysts at BMO said the offer of p per share was below their valuation of p per share.“DNO’s bid looks opportunistic, coming on the back of recent weakness in commodity markets,” they said.“Faroe’s strong balance sheet and growth trajectory means it is relatively well insulated against short-term oil price moves.”This was echoed by Cantor Fitzgerald, who said: “While DNO’s signicant existing stake may make a takeover now appear ultimately inevitable, in our view investors would be ill-advised to accept what is clearly a “low-ball” offer.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835746.1543348948!/image/image.jpg","title":"how to bridge scotland s attainment gap dr geetha marcus","story":"We need to think outside the box when reimagining Scotland#s education system, writes Dr Geetha MarcusThe UK has one of the most socially segregated school systems in the developed world, with academic selection – where children are admitted to a school on the basis of ability – and parental choice at its core.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentbelieves this has a negative impact on social equality and a young person’s ability to earn a good income in the future. OECD evidence shows that segregated schools present children with two dferent perspectives of the world and affect their le chances.Effects of povertyThere is a strong link between a pupil’s socioeconomic status and how well they do in school. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds have a higher chance of failing. Children and young people living in the most deprived communities do signicantly worse at all levels of the education system than those from more affluent backgrounds. This is often referred to as the “attainment gap”.In Scotland, it is estimated that one in four children is living in poverty. European Commission figures suggest this is higher than in many other countries in Europe and the Institute for Fiscal Studiespredicts that more than one-third of children in the UK will be living in poverty by  .• : Scottish schools struggle to fill nearly  teaching postsIn , Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, declared that the Scottish government would “draw on successful ideas from around the world” to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds and close the attainment gap. She introduced a range of initiatives, not only in the education sector, but across health, childcare, social services, welfare and employment. Some of these measures introduced as a matter of urgency have already proved controversial, such as the national testing of P pupilswhich parents and teachers complained had caused some children distress. Schools play a signicant role, but the initiatives adopted need to follow a long arc of slow structural change. Short-term political fixes have been tried for decades, yet people in Scotland and the rest of the UK continue to live in a deeply unequal society ided by class, income and poverty.Following the FinnsFinland is widely recognised as being an educational success story. Like Scotland, it has a population of around five million which shares the same culture, language and a keen sense of social justice. But after the Second World War the Finns recognised that a society ided by class and poverty would weaken their country further, so they embarked on long-term structural reform abolishing private and selective schools in favour of a system in which every child would attend high-quality state schools. The Finns reduced socio-economic inequality by reducing inequality in the education system.Having dferent educational provisions and greater freedom for parents to choose their preferred school may seem democratic, but it leads to a country that separates children and damages the very fabric of democracy it seeks to champion. I think there are three fundamental ways to help bridge the educational ide in Scotland.First, as the Finns have done, the government should look beyond parental choice and introduce the “common school” which provides basic comprehensive education to serve all children equally well, regardless of family background. Not just a form of school organisation, the idea of the common school embodies a philosophy of education as well as a deep set of values about what all children need and deserve.Second, the quality of teachers and teaching is crucial for effective learning and can have a demonstrable impact on a disadvantaged pupil’s prospects. Teachers need to be paid at a level that will attract top graduates, so that the profession becomes more appealing and valued.According to the OECD the UK has one of the least well-paid and youngest teaching workforces in the EU, predominantly populated by women. Because teaching is a highly skilled profession, only teachers who are academically well-qualied, research literate and socially committed should be encouraged to teach Scotland’s children.Freedom and trustA long-term solution for reducing the attainment gap is to restore a culture of responsibility and trust within the education system that values teacher and head teacher professionalism in judging what is best for students. The Scottish Government has pledged £m directly to head teachers, which although considered a sound idea by the OECD, has been met with concern due to a lack of clear guidance on how this money should be spent.Striking a balance between accountability and autonomy, with greater levels of responsibility, flexibility and freedom to be creative in addressing pupils’ needs takes time. Research suggests that encouraging schools to make their own decisions about how best to support their pupils to do well is essential for closing the attainment gap.Third, the standard of literacy has fallen in Scotland over the past four years. Literacy and le chances are closely linked, and evidence suggests that libraries can contribute to improving quality of le for all. Starting with areas that have been designated as deprived, new public libraries should be built or existing community libraries transformed.Raising the level of literacy is not just about the child, it has to involve the literacy of families and communities too. As we see in places such as Finland and Singapore, public libraries can serve as the educational and cultural bedrock of a community, and could help work towards closing the attainment gap.Persistent poverty exacerbated by budget cuts and coupled with entrenched mindsets in government and education are all obstacles in the current climate.There is an urgent need to think out of the box and to re-imagine long-term solutions to reverse the inequalities that face disadvantaged children in Scotland.• Geetha Marcus is lecturer in education at the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of GlasgowThis article first appeared at theconversation©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835761.1543396750!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland lagging behind uk in jobs and population","story":"Scotland was one of the worst performers for both job creation and population growth over the last decade when compared to other UK regions and nations, analysis has found.London has seen one third of all new jobs created across the UK in the past ten years.However, Scotland, which makes up  per cent of the UK population, is one of the worst performers for both job creation and population growth out of the  UK regions.Scotland added , jobs over the decade from  to , or  per cent of the UK total jobs added in that time, research by the BBC Shared Data Unit found.The number of workers in Scotland increased by  per cent over the decade.Scotland’s population increased . per cent in the same period, the third lowest rise behind the north-east of England and Wales.However, average hourly pay for workers in Scotland increased by  per cent over the decade, the second highest rise of any nation or region behind Northern Ireland.Ronald MacQuaid, professor of work and employment at the University of Stirling, said manufacturing industry had suffered over the past threedecades, but London was benefiting from its concentration of financial services.“Productivity is a big problem,” he said. “We are in a productivity crisis, it has barely changed in the last ten years.“One of the arguments made in the beginning of the recession was workers took real pay cuts infor keeping their jobs – so therewasn’t the incentive to improve productivity.“If you take on labour that is relatively cheap you don’t invest in infrastructure.“I personally think London’s productivity is heavily influenced by financial services – staff can make a lot of money and productivity isoften measured by salaries.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"views sought on fishing after brexit ","story":"“What will Brexit mean for your fishing community ” – was the question posed by university academics this week.But sadly the public event on Wednesday night at the Thule Bar in Lerwick did not pull in visitors to share their views.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when the doors will actually re-open for HLH cardholders but there was no response.It is understood the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for pound, in year one pound, in year two and pound, in

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it. There have been no discussions with them on the route map.Quizzed on their funding role she said there had been no talks with them yet.There have been calls the operator to be removed by owners HIE because of a loss of faith in them and a lack of investment with pound.m pledged in  not materialising.Charlotte Wright, HIE chief executive, said: \"Clearly poundm, even over  years, is a large investment for a single resort, and funding is often the most challenging of all obstacles.\"Highland Council convener Bill Lobban said the uplt review provides \"a fantastic, positive view of the potential future for Cairngorm\".The report also says there should be improved transport links between Cairngorm and the broader Aviemore area to ease pressure on car parking.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117294.jpg","title":"Hotel boss set for talks on Aviemore pool wrangle","story":"Thebossof Macdonald Hotels has said that talks will reopen with Highland Council later this month over access to the Macdonald Aviemore Resort pool.Donald Macdonald, chairman and founder of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said \"there has always been a real willingness on our part to reach a sustainable deal\".Members of High Le Highland have been unable to use the resortrsquos pool since the end of August because of a funding wrangle.The hotel group is seeking more funding than has been put on the table by Highland Council.Macdonald Hotels has mainly remained silent since the end of the summer.But the Strathy received a y statement yesterday from the company on the latest situation, and also criticising a local Highland councillor for his intervention at council headquarters on the wrangle.In the statement, Mr Macdonald said: \"There is nothing that would please us more than having this situation resolved.\"In fact, wersquod already written to the council underlining how keen we were to have further talks and welcomed the positive interventions by Drew Hendry MP and Kate Forbes MSP, who have taken a mature, non-partisan approach to matters.\"He then went on to attack Councillor John Bruce for a question he put before the full council in Inverness a week ago.In it he quizzed leader Margaret Davidson on the role of public money in securing public access for swimming at the resort.The hotel boss described Councillor John Brucersquos question as \"poorly-researched, fatuous and ill-informed\".The statement went on: \"Hersquos showing breath-taking cheek in attempting to re-write history, so itrsquos worth rehearsing the facts, both for his benefit but more so for local people.\"In , a partnership of Bank of Scotland, Tulloch and ourselves brought forward ambitious plans to invest poundm at the Aviemore Resort which had fallen into disrepair after many years of neglect, to the extent that it was described at the time as lsquohaving all the charm of a disused air raid shelterrsquo.\"Given the enormous potential benefits of this scheme to the local and Highland economies, and the large numbers of jobs which would be created, Highlands  Islands Enterprise supported the project with a grant of pound.m - not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Wednesday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newly published childrens book aims to teach important message for a worthy cause","story":"A new children’s book, designed to introduce small children to the world’s big issues and aid vital charity work, is the latest work of West Belfast woman Arlene Gormley.Co-founder of the Feeding Dreams Cambodia charity, Arlene has penned, designed and illustrated ‘ Not A Fairytale’ describing how even from a young age we can work to make the planet better for now and future generations.Feeding Dreams Cambodia was founded in  and offers free education and nutrition for  children in Cambodia’s tourist capital of Siem Reap. The charity receives no government funding and relies solely on donations, most of which comes from support and fundraising drives in Belfast. Arlene explained how the book is based on the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsthat recognise ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education.“Our approach at Feeding Dreams is holistic,” explained Arlene. “ Our programmes in education, medical care, community support, vocational training, they are all interlinked, so when the UN announced the  Goals, it helped give us the framework and language for our strategy. Since each of our programmes can be tied to one of the  SDGs and the Cambodian government ratied the SDGs, it gave us legitimacy and credibility.”“I decided to create a handmade book introducing the SDGs to young children through colourful pictures with simplistic explanations. The book was originally intended as a keepsake for my four-year-old niece Zara but the message has struck a chord with parents and teachers. I’m holding a book launch on Saturday in the city centre’s Learning Space store and all sales from the book will go towards the work of the charity. “During the Christmas period people are very generous with their donations but it’s when all the rush calms down and we go into what we call our ‘leaner’ months of January, February that we need that extra push make sure all the children receive a proper, balanced meal.”Arlene became a mother herself in August and is now more determined than ever to ensure her daughter Julia has a keen understanding of the world around her.“Children are born into an uncertain and unequal world and parents worry about the kind of environment their children grow up in. It’s important to me that my daughter understands from a early age about important issues that will affect her future, like climate change, access to health and education, and the importance of equality.” The Queen’s University graduate spoke of how the visually striking picture book was “something a little dferent” for the bedtime hour. “It’s a great way to sit with a child and read each chapter, look at the illustrations, it’s a great tool to show what is going on in the world and at the same time contribute to the work of Feeding Dreams.”Arlene will be signing copies of her book at Fountain Centre’s Learning Space store on Saturday, December  from am until noon.

More than , local children live in homes haunted by poverty.That means families with increasing debts, choices between ‘heat or eat’, teenagers with a limited or non-existent social le and an increased risk of chronic illness.”She continued: “Children living in poverty also consistently underperform at school and find it harder to get a job when they leave.“The highest levels of poverty are to be found in the Colin Glen and Falls areas,” she added.North Belfast follows closely behind the West Belfast statistics with , children living in child poverty. In South Belfast the figures are just over half of this with , children affected. East Belfast stands at ,.Research by Save the Children has shown that around  per cent of parents in poverty say their children have to go without new shoes when they need them and a large number of children in poverty say they are missing out on things that many other children take for granted, such as going on school trips and having a warm coat in winter.“The introduction of Universal Credit, cuts to health and education budgets, pressures on community, voluntary and youth services all compound the problems already affecting thousands of local families – many of them with a least one partner working, it is unforgivable,” said Ms Lowry.“While in Government Sinn Féin and the DUP refused to implement the promised Anti- Poverty Strategy and sent powers relating to Universal Credit to Westminster. As a result thousands of local children and their families continue to suffer a hardship and deprivation that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.“If there is a more important political priority in West Belfast than addressing child poverty, then perhaps some local MLAs would like to tell me about it.”Commenting on the report and its findings West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that the issue of child poverty needs to #reduce and reduce rapidly#.#In my view one child living in poverty is one too many.

everyone is coming from, I suppose thats the thing,\" he said.\"You can see where the DUP is coming from, you can see where the other sides are coming from.\"But what you cant see at the moment is where the balance of power truly is and who wins.\"The DUP and other parties here have been at loggerheads over the Prime Ministers Brexit deal.Arlene Fosters DUP refuses to back it, claiming it erodes Northern Irelands constitutional position in the UK, while other parties support the deal, as do business leaders.Mr Webb was a BBC trainee journalist in Belfast during the Troubles.He lived on Wellington Park Avenue with the current science editor of BBC News, David Shukman.Mr Webbsaid: \"I came from London in the s and there were bombs and bullets and soldiers and all the rest of it, but I

the Today programme in .On Northern Ireland, he said: \"Now, obviously, I come back and physically cant recognise the place.\"But he warned against ato sectarianism.\"Well, I think the problem is that young people dont remember how awful it was and thats part of one of the issues that we want to explore,\" he commented.\"The memories fade in a good way, but they also fade in a bad way and it was so ided for so long and it was such a miserable experience for so many people that its almost inconceivable that people would knowingly go back to it.\"As a co-host on the flagship news show, Mr Webb is well versed on Brexit.He commented: \"Because of the Northern Ireland backstop being such a huge issue, we will be talking a little bit about what people are saying about it.\"I do feel that those questions are often answered in the studio in London and it will be interesting to hear them asked and answered at Ulster University.\"The shows visit to Ulster Universitys York Street campus in

There were restrictions put on the people who were there to witness proceedings, no one is allowed to discuss what happened in terms of the evidence or process.\"The powers that be, who took the decision to put him in prison, have in one part been persuaded by all sorts of representation and by the public protests that were taking place and beginning to grow. \"I think that may have affected their point of view.\"There has been quite a lot of input talking about the very negative effects that this type of legal internment is having on any kind of hope for the future in this society. \"People were beginning to questionanything had changed orwe were right back where we started in the s.\"Nothing essentially has changed insofar that Tony has been inside for several years, so his behaviour or actions have not changed. \"So I would say that it is more to do with public opinion than politics.

The leading architect revealed he had received more than a dozen unsolicited emails from engineers and geologists inquiring about the project since the speech on Saturday. “It has been bubbling along since January,” said Professor Dunlop. “I thought that was the end of it, and then something  happens.“And then with Boris Johnson, Karen Bradley and the DUP bringing it up again, it just seems like a potential story and narrative which keeps moving on.”Last week the bridge was raised during a discussion in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. Responding to a question from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Secretary of State Karen Bradley said she was willing to have a discussion about commissioning a feasibility study on the bridge, but noted there were issues around the sea bed and the current site of the proposed bridge link. Addressing the DUP annual conference on Saturday, former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said proposals for a bridge link were being held back by the “absence of political will”. “I think that there will be a feasibility study, which is all I can ask for. That’s all I’ve ever asked for,” said Professor Dunlop.“I am not suggesting for a moment it is going to be a walk in the park. Instead people providing opinions about whether it can be done or not, it would be good to actually get the facts.”Boris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and ScotlandSDLP MLA criticises Paisley for obsessing over Northern Ireland to Scotland bridgeMr Johnson first expressed his support for a bridge back in June, when he called for the proposal to be taken “seriously”. Mr Dunlop first envisioned the idea for the bridge link after being asked to do so by a newspaper in Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route — one from Larne and Portpatrick, potentially costing around £bn or a shorter crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head, which could cost between £bn and £bn.The proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would “initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity” between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important “that all options are fully considered”."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands of scots supported by new employment service","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

If anyone sees a route we have missed, please lest us know.Maurice added: ldquoWe hope that future editions can both improve the content and mapping of North Lecale and cover the Lecale coastline all the way to Dundrum Bay.ldquoThe book would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who loves Lecale or anyone with relatives aboard this Christmas who want to be reminded of the beautul Barony of Lecale and the local history of each parish. We have fully funded this publication so every book sold goes to develop local community walking routes and it will be available in most local shops.Cllr Enright said he was grateful for the knowledge and support he had received from older people ldquosteeped in folklore from every village and townland over the past year in producing the book as well as the invaluable technical expertise of his co-author Duane.ldquoPeople like Terry Swail, from Kilclief, Portaferryrsquos Lennie Lawson and Vincie Curran, from Myra, gave their time freely and ungrudgingly to make this publication such a success, he said.Councillor Enright said the book emerged from the process of developing village plans over the past five years with many public consultations highlighting the need for safe, off-road walking routes to keep people active and healthy.ldquoEvery village wanted to know how their walks could be integrated into the wider network of trails around Lecale, he continued. ldquoThere was a demand to know the details of the law and how they could assert local walking routes in their area.ldquoResidentsrsquo associations in the Downpatrick area led by those in Stream Street actually commissioned technical reports into how walks like the four kilometre Quoile River Walk could once again be integrated with the network of parks like Delamont and Castle Ward.Cllr Enright added: ldquoThey wanted cycleways on new greenways to Dundrum, Ballynahinch, Belfast and Comber following old railway lines and we packed all this information into the book with maps, photographs and references. I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The prime minister met business and voluntary leaders and later talked to politicians at StormontNigel Dodds told this newspaper after the DUP conference at the weekend that Tory backbench opposition to the backstop was growing, and Arlene Foster told the media yesterday that opposition to that Withdrawal Agreement at Westminster was “coalescing” around the backstop.We asked Mrs May about a letter that Boris Johnson sent her earlier this year, reported in The Times on Monday, in which the then foreign secretary appeared to consider checks in the Irish Sea as one solution to the land border problem. Mr Johnson delighted DUP delegates at their conference when, in contrast to any acceptance of an internal UK border, he called for the backstop to be ditched.Mrs May told us yesterday that “everyone is clear that eventhe backstop is invoked it is only intended to be temporary.There is ious elements throughout the Withdrawal Agreement that make that absolutely clear”.Her full answer is set out below.Theresa May speaking during her visit to Queens University. She was in Northern Ireland to sell her Brexit deal. The News Letter asked her questions about the controversial border backstopHowever, it will not reassure critics who say that the arrangement is in theory temporary but will apply until the European Union assents to a dferent arrangement or agrees a trade deal, and that they will never agree to anything that does not in effect leave Northern Ireland in the EU customs and regulatory zone.Any such agreement has to be unanimous between all  European Union countries, and would need the assent of the Republic of Ireland, which has made clear that it will not accept ergence on those matters.• Morning View: PM has no good answer on backstop The News Letter also asked Mrs May about paragraph  of the backstop, which was inserted last December days after the DUP opposed the initial version of the backstop, and which appeared to rule out an Irish Sea border.Paragraph  read: “In the absence of agreed solutions, as set out in the previous paragraph, the UK will ensure that no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, unless, consistent with the  Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree that distinct arrangements are appropriate... In all circumstances, the UK will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for Northern Ireland’s businesses to the whole of the UK internal market.”However, the Alliance Party, Green Party, SDLP and Sinn Feinhave jointly lobbied Brussels, including the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, against allowing Stormont such a power. In February and March, when the EU set out its legal interpretation of the backstop, paragraph  was not mentioned or legislated for. The prime minister opposed the EU interpretation and said that no prime minister of the UK could agree such a commitment, which would create an internal UK border.Government to set out economic impact of Brexit as May fights to save deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Asked yesterday why since then the government had abandoned paragraph , which had given reassurance to unionists, Mrs May adopted a number of arguments.First she said that “what arrangements we put in place in the United Kingdom for determining whether there should be any regulatory ergence is actually a matter for us”.She then pointed to regulatory checks that already exist in the Irish Sea .Mrs May then implied that the UK would not erge in many regulations from the EU in any event ahead of a trade deal in which it might have to match such regulations.The prime minister also noted that the Assembly is not ing: “Obviously at the moment we don’t have a Stormont Executive and Assembly, we continue to work to get one in place because I think that is the best position for Northern Ireland to be in, to have its devolved administration in place.” Critics of this argument had dismissed it because the backstop, including paragraph , was agreed when Stormont was suspended sothat argument applies now, it also applied when the paragraph was agreed.We were unable to ask Mrs May about this apparent inconsistency in her position with regard to paragraph , because the regional press were all allowed only two questions each.The full text of her answers to the News Letter is laid out below. • Morning View: PM has no good answer on backstop The News Letter questions with the prime minister and her answer were as follows:Question: Prime Minister, The Times reported yesterday that Boris Johnson earlier this year had sent you a letter considering solutions to the Irish border, one of which was checks in the Irish Sea. You have stated your own unionism. Have you not presided over a situation in which [under] another prime minister, be it for example a Brexiteer who is determined above all  to get a deal for England, or a sympathetic to Irish republican prime minister, Northern Ireland cannot get free of the customs union Answer: No,we just look at the backstop and why it is there. First of all, all sides are clear that we want to work, and there are clauses in the legal Withdrawal Agreement on best endeavours and so forth and the action that can be takenbest endeavour aren’t used to get the future relationship finalised by December , such that there is no need to use any interim period, to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The backstop will only be considered, and it is not an automatic even in these circumstances, the backstop will only be consideredit is the case, that there is a short period of time, a temporary period, when it is necessary to continue to — when the future relationship is not in place, so we need some other way of continuing to guarantee no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland — as I say in that period, it doesn’t have to be the backstop it could be an extension to the implementation period, the transition period as it is referred to in the Withdrawal Agreement, but everyone is clear that eventhe backstop is invoked it is only intended to be temporary.There is ious elements throughout the Withdrawal Agreement that make that absolutely clear.Q: But prime minister you didn’t even try to apply paragraph  [of the  backstop in the Joint Report] which gave a lot of unionists here reassurance and is one of the reasons why there was no uproar after the revised backstop of last December.A. Well paragraph  refers to what you could call the Stormont lock, the issue of —I could just address the issue, because there is a wider answer to the issue on regulation — but, um, that was about regulatory ergence requiring the approval of Stormont. Now what arrangements we put in place in the United Kingdom for determining whether there should be any regulatory ergence is actually a matter for us. Obviously at the moment we don’t have a Stormont executive and assembly, we continue to work to get one in place because I think that is the best position for Northern Ireland to be in, to have its devolved administration in place.In terms of regulatory ergence, of course there already is regulatory ergence today between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in some limited areas. If you look at a temporary period of a backstop, and I have said and have said it in the House of Commons, I am looking to see how I can give reassurance on this, during the temporary period of the backstop it actually wouldn’t make any real sense for Great Britain, for the UK government to say that Great Britain should erge in regulations which we might then be entering back into in the future relationship.So there is some I hope some reassurance there that I am looking at what reassurance I can give that actually wouldn’t see that extra regulatory ergence that everyone is concerned about.We have that regulatory ergence today, we are one United Kingdom but there is an exception for the particular position of Northern Ireland in the regulations as they are applied today.[All papers were allowed only two questions]Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8720185.1543339763!/image/image.jpg","title":"business","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Business   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Business Politics Crime Farming Education Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Business      Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role lsquovery interestingrsquoDUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has described his  months as unofficial trade envoy to Libya as #a very interesting experience#.

Until December , the Red Cross shop in Botanic Avenue, Belfast is offering a free Christmas card with every pack bought in store, and asking shoppers to show their kindness by writing a message to someone receiving support from the British Red Cross. The cards will be sent to a local ‘Connecting Communities’ service provided in partnership with Co-op, which helps support adults in the community who are experiencing or at risk of loneliness. The Red Cross has launched the initiative in participating shops across the country, after new research showed more than half of UK adults feel always, often or sometimes lonely.The charity poll conducted by Opinium sought the responses of over , UK adults. Of those  people polled in Northern Ireland % said they often feel alone and like they have no one to turn to.Almost halfsaid their neighbours are like strangers to them while % of those who do have people they feel close to or can rely on say those people live far away from them.More one in tendon’t have friends they feel close to or can talk to.Last year the British Red Cross supported over , people in crisis across the UK, giving them someone they could turn to in their hour of need.Elizabeth Boyd from the Red Cross’ Belfast office said: “Loneliness and social isolation doesn’t discriminate. “Le circumstances can change in the blink of an eye, meaning it can happen to anyone, no matter your age or background.“We all need someone to turn to in a crisis, but the findings of our research suggest that there are many people in our communities feeling they lack meaningful, human connections.“Every one of us would want someone to reach out to uswe found ourselves all alone. “People who need our help may be closer than we think, and could feel much more connectedwe offer them our kindness.“By sending a message of support to someone in your community who may be alone this festive season, you can help them know you’re thinking of them.”For more information visit www.redcross.org.uktry catch     .               ..

Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been followed in London and secretly filmed by those acting on behalf of the Erdogan regime.ldquoI have received dozens of death threats, provoked by the actions of those at the highest level of the Turkish government.Mr Ipek said the threats and harassment waged against him in Britain have been reported to police, but he is not worried he is under threat.He told reporters his brother has been in jail in Turkey for more than three years on ldquobaseless grounds and with no access to justice.He also highlighted how there are thousands of other businessmen, judges, civil servants and journalists ldquounable to make their case due to the collapse of democracy and the rule of law in Turkey.He added: ldquoThe human rights abuses taking place are unacceptable for any civilised country and action must be taken to urgently end this.He said that while he would not go back to Turkey tomorrow, he would like toone day, as he called on politicians in his home country to respect the rule of law.Mr Ipekrsquos solicitor, Michael Drury, said ldquoseldom can there have been a case of a nation state persecuting three obviously innocent men on perverse grounds.He added: ldquoThe British public will find it surprising that a case like this was certied by the Home Secretary for bringing before the court..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Judge rejects Turkey us extradition request against media tycoon over coup bid article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,Comments are closed on this article.Contact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities.

I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
