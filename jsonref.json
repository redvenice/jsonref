Manafort practiced law with Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease in Washington DC between 1977 and 1980.As reported in Vox, Paul Manafort is somewhat of a legend within Republican circles and his career can be split into three phases. He first garnered recognition within the party after working for Ford’s 1976 and Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaigns and, after the latter President’s success, he cashed in and started a consultancy business with the infamous Roger Stone.The firm became renowned for representing controversial types such as President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Angola’s guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi, but occasionally dipped his toes into politics now and again, for example, to manage the 1996 Republican convention.In 2004, Manafort began to advise oligarchs in the former Soviet Union and soon focused on Ukraine, landing a contract to advise the country’s pro-Russian party. He worked to ensure that the Party of Regions leader Viktor Yanukovych returned to power he was elected President in 2010.However, demonstrators forced Yanukovych out and Manafort was involved in a lawsuit with President of Rusal Oleg Deripaska after the latter accused him of cheating him out of millions. At this point, Manafort had lost his income of millions and the FBI were investigating money he had earned from Ukraine.After being recommended by Roger Stone and the real estate investor Tom Barrack, Trump hired Manafort in March 2016 to lead his presidential campaign and in two months, was named campaign chair and chief strategist.However, polls were not looking good in August of the same year and amid reports that his Ukrainian payments were not legitimate, Manafort was out and Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon were in. Following this, he came under fire in Robert Mueller’s investigation which led to his indictment.          Paul Manafort stands with Donald and Ivanka Trump at the Republican National ConventionManafort\u0027s wifePaul Manafort has been married to Kathleen Bond Manafort since August 12, 1978 and she is a lawyer who has stayed out of the media, although it was widely reported that when FBI agents conducted a raid of their Alexandria, Virginia house in July 2017, they were in bed together.Since then, she has been a major part of the investigation, as Business Insider reported, because Kathleen has had a hand in a number of the couple’s major purchases. The Manaforts have bought numerous properties in Florida, Virginia and New York, in addition to a Trump Tower apartment in 2006 and a horse farm, which was sold in 2004.Properties that were initially purchased in Kathleen’s name have cropped up in the indictment, but beyond records about homes that they bought together, not much is known about the relationship between Kathleen and Paul Manafort.However, The National Enquirer, owned by American Media CEO David Pecker, a friend of Trump’s, has reported that Manafort had an affair with a much younger woman. Text messages between their daughters Andrea and Jessica also suggested that the marriage was breaking down.Manafort net worthThe former Trump campaign manager claimed that he was worth $28 million in November 2017, but many have had their doubts about this figure, especially because of his Trump Tower apartment, as reported in Bloomberg.A federal court filing read: ‘Although Manafort has provided the government with a spreadsheet listing his total assets at approximately $28 million, the government has yet to substantiate Manafort’s net worth.‘To ensure that any bail package is based on an accurate picture of his finances, we submit that Manafort should be required to represent the full extent of his assets, in the United States and abroad, to the court.’           Paul Manafort arrives with his wife Kathleen Manafort at the Albert V. Bryan U.S. CourthousePaul Manafort chargesPaul Manafort has been charged for what Mueller refers to as ‘the tax scheme’ and the Ukrainian money that allowed the former consultant to maintain his glamorous lifestyle. Mueller also claimed that Manafort had set up offshore shell companies and then spent $30 million of offshore cash in the US from 2008 to 2014.$12 million was spent on ‘personal items’ for the Manaforts which was spread over 200 transactions and included $5.4 million to a home improvement company in the Hamptons, $1.3 million to an antique rug store in Virginia, $849,000 to a men’s clothing store in New York, $819,000 on landscaping, and for several Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz.Another $6.4 million was wired from offshore for a $1.5 million New York City condo, a $3 million Brooklyn brownstone and a $1.9 million Virginia house. It is also alleged that Manafort sent another $13 million to companies that the controlled, which the government claimed was to reduce his taxable income.For this, Manafort was charged with five counts of false income tax return and four counts for failure to report foreign bank or financial assets. The second set of charges are what Mueller has referred to as ‘the financial institution scheme’.These accusations are related to incidents when Manafort allegedly made a series of fraudulent declarations to banks to obtain mortgage loans after Yanukovych was deposed and his income stopped coming in.Manafort trial start datePaul Manafort’s trial started on Tuesday, July 31 2018 and is expected to last about two to three weeks. Mueller will likely call up to 35 people to testify, with the top witness being Rick Gates, Manafort’s right-hand man who worked with him in Ukraine and in the Trump campaign.Tad Devine is also another big name on the list and he is known for advising Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential campaign, but also worked with Manafort in Ukraine. It is not known how Manafort and his lawyers will argue the case.Judge T.S. Ellis, however, has said that because of ‘the apparent weight of the evidence against him’, Manafort ‘faces the very real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.’          Paul Manafort talks to reporters at the Republican National Convention with Rick Gates behindWhy are there two Paul Manafort trials?Manafort is currently facing two federal trials: one which will be in the Eastern District of Virginia and has already begun, and the other in the District of Columbia, expected to begin on September 17. Mueller originally indicted Manafort in October 2017, but for reasons which are still unknown, he was not prepared to bring the tax and bank fraud charges against Manafort at the time.By February 2018, Mueller was ready to file the charges, but because law required some of the counts to be charged where Manafort lived — in Alexandria, Virginia — unless Manafort gave Mueller permission to charge him in DC, Manafort was given a choice.While it is cheaper for the defendant to prepare one trial rather than two, going through with the two separate trials would give the prosecution two separate opportunities to convict him. In addition to this, because DC is more liberal than Virginia, Manafort would have more of a chance of acquittal in the Eastern District. Although Manafort did not give Mueller permission to file the newer charges in DC, he miscalculated and the charges that were filed later, in the district known as the \u0027rocket docket\u0027, were brought to trial first.  Barbara McQuade, Professor from Practice at the University of Michigan Law School, also explained to Slate why he will face two different trials.‘Prosecutors sought to bring all of the charges in one venue, but Manafort declined to waive venue, which is his legal right,’ she explained.Emma Husar: Sydney MP accused of making \u0026#8216Basic Instinct\u0026#8217 move in Jason Clare\u0026#8217s office revealedMount Olympus is celebrated with a Google DoodleIs Justin Bieber dissing Hailey Baldwin\u0027s ex Shawn Mendes in No Brainer song with DJ Khaled?Reddit hacked: What to do after emails and passwords were leakedNational Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 1st AugustFacebook added a plane emoji reaction and people are confusedLyme disease: What is it?

Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped to create a new raft of grammar schools in the poorest areas of the countrySupporters say they can provide an academically rigorous education for bright pupils whose families do not have enough money to send them to private school.But critics say grammars are disproportionately filled with middle-class children, since their families can afford to coach them for the entrance exams.Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped to create a new raft of grammar schools in the poorest areas of the country which would specifically target disadvantaged children.It would have involved overturning a law imposed by Tony Blair in 1998 which banned the creation of new grammars.Mrs May was forced to abandon this plan when she lost her Commons majority, but she has said she is still committed to helping existing ones to expand.BBC analysis of admissions policies of grammars found 93 of the remaining 163 schools have a priority policy for disadvantaged pupils of some kind.These include admitting poorer children with lower test scores, or creating quotas.In one example, Bournemouth Grammar School has said that next year all disadvantaged children passing the test will be awarded places first regardless of where they live.Headteacher Dorian Lewis said: \u0027I think we\u0027re going back to why grammar schools were established, to serve the most able children no matter what their background.\u0027The new places at grammars make up just over 1 per cent of the 825,000 new school places which have been created since 2010.

If applicants cannot show how they will increase access, they will not be eligible for funding.\u0027Rebecca Hickman, vice chairman of anti-grammar group Comprehensive Future, said: \u0027The 11-plus effectively tests for social background and prior opportunity, not for aptitude.

Graham Chapman, who played the titular character, accused his fellow Pythons of greed and selfishness in a handwritten note sent before the film\u0027s release in 1979In one of the unseen sketches a man appears from the desert in need of a beer only to find a Wild West saloon which is actually a bookshop.The Pink Knight sketch, which was written by Palin and Jones, begins with a knight standing \u0027in a slightly camp pose\u0027 while declaring that King Arthur cannot cross a bridge unless he gives him a kiss.Another unused script in the archive has a handwritten sequence for Sir Tristram, a knight who tries ineptly to track down the grail using scientific principles.Palin, 75, has given permission for the sketches to be reproduced and said the group often created more material than was needed.Among the more controversial draft sketches to come out of the archive is one which sees Lazarus visiting his doctor with \u0027post-death depression\u0027.Written by Michael Palin, the sketch sees Lazarus\u0027s doctor criticise Jesus for resurrecting the dead, adding \u0027he has nothing against him personally.\u0027 But Palin himself abandoned the sketch, branding it \u0027as pat, neat and predictable as a bad university sketch.\u0027Other documents reveal the Phythons\u0027 lawyer telling them he was \u0027a little nervous\u0027 about a scene in which a woman claims to have fallen pregnant by the Holy Spirit, branding it \u0027a horny little poltergeist.\u0027 He also told the team to cut a scene in which they refer to Jesus as \u0027some long-haired conjurer\u0027. Monty Python: Fraught memo reveals strife over Life of Brian | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/02/09/4EC2E2E800000578-6018527-image-m-9_1533200300508.jpg","title":"Rare 5 note engraved portrait Englands Harry Kane spent licence Wales","story":"    Graham Short has etched a portrait of Harry Kane (pictured) on to a number of £5 notes.

Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped to create a new raft of grammar schools in the poorest areas of the countrySupporters say they can provide an academically rigorous education for bright pupils whose families do not have enough money to send them to private school.But critics say grammars are disproportionately filled with middle-class children, since their families can afford to coach them for the entrance exams.Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped to create a new raft of grammar schools in the poorest areas of the country which would specifically target disadvantaged children.It would have involved overturning a law imposed by Tony Blair in 1998 which banned the creation of new grammars.Mrs May was forced to abandon this plan when she lost her Commons majority, but she has said she is still committed to helping existing ones to expand.BBC analysis of admissions policies of grammars found 93 of the remaining 163 schools have a priority policy for disadvantaged pupils of some kind.These include admitting poorer children with lower test scores, or creating quotas.In one example, Bournemouth Grammar School has said that next year all disadvantaged children passing the test will be awarded places first regardless of where they live.Headteacher Dorian Lewis said: \u0027I think we\u0027re going back to why grammar schools were established, to serve the most able children no matter what their background.\u0027The new places at grammars make up just over 1 per cent of the 825,000 new school places which have been created since 2010.

There are now calls for him to resign after huge spending cuts were announced          Councillors from Northamptonshire County Council hold an extraordinary meeting in Northampton amid concerns that it will no longer be able to pay for services for vulnerable children and adultsThe £53 million Great Copper-Finned Elephant          Northamptonshire County Council has banned all new spending after announcing an overspend of £21m for the 2017-18 period. One Angel Square cost the council £53millionOne Angel Square Northampton is an award-winning ‘state of the art’ office building.Commissioned by Northamptonshire County Council as the authority’s new administrative headquarters, it was supposed to reflect both the county’s cobbling heritage and its cutting-edge future. No expense was spared.‘The predominantly glazed facades are clad with vertical copper fins, inspired by the traditional leather cutting lines for hand-made shoes, which control solar gain and create a colour and texture, particularly when viewed from acute angles down the streets,’ cooed the publicity blurb.Designed by the same firm of international architects which recently won the contract for the multi-billion-pound restoration of the Palace of Westminster, One Angel Square eventually cost £53million. The then Communities Secretary Sajid Javid officially opened the council HQ in October last year, giving a rousing speech in the four-storey atrium. And then?Within months Mr Javid was ordering an investigation into the council while One Angel Square was put up for sale and sold to a Canadian investment firm. The Canadians are now leasing it back to the council, which is desperately looking for tenants to sublet more of the floor space.Instead of representing all that is good about Northamptonshire the Angel Square building is the biggest physical manifestation of a series of disastrous financial decisions by the ‘secretive and dysfunctional’ leadership.      The council spent £9,000 on jaunts to Jamaica - but are now being forced to pay off loans. Pictured: Half Moon BayThe cash-strapped council has spent £50,000 on flights in the past three years including six return trips to Montego Bay, Jamaica, worth £9,000. The Mail understands these were for officials to pay welfare visits to a young inidual who was in prison on the Caribbean island but to whom the council still owed a statutory duty of care. ‘It’s ludicrous given our debt but it’s the law and the British consulate has refused to carry out the visits for us,’ says a council insider.The cash was spent on 51 return European trips and 13 return trips outside Europe between January 2015 and February 2018.£350,000 of payouts to staffOne council worker was awarded £5,500 after she claimed her ‘poorly fitting’ uniform caused a spinal injury. Other payouts between 2006 and 2011 included £200 to a man who had ‘a large splinter in his hand causing injury’ and £12,000 to a woman hit by pots and pans when she opened a cupboard.23 employees on MORE THAN £100,000They took home a total of £3.32million in the 201617 year, a report by the TaxPayers’ Alliance found.

Thankfully, Peter Astbury’s award-wining health tech wristband now offers a stylish solutionPerimenopause – also known as the menopause transition – is experienced by millions of women every year. The months or years leading up to the menopause can have very similar symptoms to the menopause itself, although some of these symptoms may change or disappear over time. “The most common symptoms are hot flushes and night sweats, but there are also other symptoms that are less thought about,” explains Dr Louise Newson, who specialises in treating women going through the perimenopause and menopause. “Migraines, palpitations, memory problems, low mood, anxiety, joint pain, muscle stiffness, poor sleep, reduced libido,” she adds.It’s the more obscure symptoms – migraines, low mood, tiredness – that many women fail to identify as part of perimenopause, something Newson partly puts down to the “big taboo” of the menopause itself. This lack of knowledge can have a severe impact. Not realising that symptoms are part of a bigger picture, many women fail to seek appropriate treatment. Newson cites examples of patients who falsely believe their memory loss is due to dementia, or who are incorrectly prescribed high doses of antidepressants by doctors who haven’t taken hormonal changes into account. But there may be other options. The Perimenopause Challenge is a category in the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Awards that aims to find technologies that can help women track the symptoms of perimenopause – enabling them to get better support and information. The Grace Wristband, developed by designer Peter Astbury and 2018 winner of the category, operates by easing one of the worst symptoms of the perimenopause – hot flushes. At the onset of a hot flush, says Astbury, the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) is falsely triggered. The Grace Wristband contains a set of sensors that detect this reaction, activating a “cooling tile” that delivers “intense cooling to the wrist”. The goal is to “use this sensation to signal to the hypothalamus that the body should retain heat” – a response directly opposite to a hot flush. This could, says Astbury, prevent women from waking up in the night with hot flushes, alleviating many of the sleep-related issues faced during perimenopause. Astbury describes one woman going through perimenopause who, waking up sweating 15 or 20 times a night, would get up and run her wrists under cold water to cool down. “I realised at that point that creating a product that could deal with night sweats was just as important as helping with hot flushes during the day,” he says. Astbury started developing Grace when he was just 22 and attending Loughborough University – a time when, perhaps unsurprisingly, he knew “next to nothing about menopause”.During his research, Astbury heard stories from many women – and it was these that left the biggest impression. “I regularly receive messages from women desperate to be involved as research participants so they can use Grace as soon as possible,” he says. As Newson – who was one of the judges for the Perimenopause Challenge category – points out, women’s health issues are not always discussed in an open or comfortable way something Astbury hopes will change.“In the UK, and the west in general, we have developed an environment where people don’t feel comfortable talking about things like perimenopause because of associations with ageing,” he says. “Many cultures don’t suffer from the same taboos as us – one study of Mayan culture found that the menopause was associated with freedom and status, and was therefore a positive milestone in life.”The design of the wristband, says Astbury, is an attempt to break down this stigma. “The aim is for women to wear Grace with confidence – the hope is that more people will feel they can openly talk about menopause.” Astbury is hopeful that a change is taking place: “Women are increasingly talking openly about menopause and its effects,” he says. “I hope that this change gains traction and that our culture continues to evolve and become more and more open about all health-related topics.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

At Bocketts Farm in Surrey, she was minding her one-year-old and newborn baby when another mother came running past, frantically searching for her more mobile six-year-old. He had wandered off on his own, no one knew where he’d got to, and there was no way to contact him. Wong thought: “Why can’t we be more connected to our younger children?”Enter the Gator Watch, a wearable tracking device with call functionality for kids who are too young for a smartphone but old enough to want a little more independence. Wong had researched her idea and found that while there were similar products already on the market in other countries, such as China, there was nothing quite like this. And nothing at all in the UK: the market was desperate for something that filled this communication gap for five- to 10-year-old children. “When I talk to parents, everyone is in agreement,” says Wong. “No one wants to give their kid a smartphone before secondary school, they just feel there’s nothing in the market for what they want, which is pure connection.”The watch can make and receive calls from 13 trusted numbers, it has an SOS button, and if your child wanders beyond defined safe zones you’re alerted as it happens. After eight months working with a manufacturer, Wong brought the watch to market, and this year her company, Techsixtyfour, which is staffed by working mums, won the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award for the Staying Independent with Tech Challenge. The category was set up to discover technologies that facilitate monitoring and emergency contact between caregivers and their charges.Last Christmas, Dave Housley bought the watch for his son Freddie, an eight-year-old kart-racing driver who spends a lot of time travelling to and from races: clocking up hundreds of miles is not an unusual way to spend a weekend for the Housley family. “At a kart race weekend, the kids are outside, they’re playing in the woods and doing stuff that kids should do. With this watch, we’ve got more confidence to let them do that because we can track them and we can get hold of them. It gives us a lot more confidence to let a kid be a kid in today’s world it gives you more confidence in letting them out of your sight.” The watch fulfils Housley’s need to know his son is safe, and it also works for Freddie. “He loved the whole concept of it,” says Housley. “It has that element of fun to it. He’s talking into it like it’s a James Bond watch.”The device has been a roaring success, and not only for reasons Wong predicted. It was always her plan to have the watch disconnected from the internet and social media, simply because she felt children should be able to have a childhood away from the glow of screens. But it wasn’t until she heard a policeman’s feedback that she realised it was solving a much bigger, and newer, societal problem.“He had bought the watch for his eight-year-old daughter because they live on an estate, and he was just afraid for his daughter to go outside,” she says. “But as a police officer, he knows that it’s far more dangerous for a child to stay at home and play on their screens. Parents might fear that allowing their children to go outside would mean they’d get kidnapped, but the amount of danger online is actually far higher – that parents are getting this wrong has been an eye-opener.”Wong has also found another vital use for the Gator Watch: helping older people. Ingrid Ehrlich’s husband, now 85, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. “A year and a half ago he went for the newspaper,” says Ehrlich. “He did it every morning, and one day he didn’t come back. It was an hour before he went into the newsagent and bought the paper. Nobody can find out what he did in that hour.”Since getting the watch, Ehrlich has stopped locking the doors of the house in case her husband wanders off. He comes and goes as he pleases, while she monitors a map on her computer. “It’s the only thing he does on his own, so I encourage it. He just feels that he has much more freedom.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

Robert and his entourage of soldiers, who are all due to leave the city the next day, drink, quote Baudelaire and debate “the dirty trade of war”.“I did it to save the lives of people who had not hired out to fight,” the narrator explains. “There was that and the fact that I had learned to know and love an infantry ision and wished to serve it in any useful way I could … I also loved France and Spain next to my own country. I loved other countries too but the debt was paid and I thought that the account was closed, not knowing the accounts are never closed.”Hemingway had a particular fondness for Paris’s Ritz hotel, which also appears in The Sun Also Rises. In 1944, as the German occupying forces fled Paris, Hemingway, who was working as a war correspondent, arrived at the hotel in a Jeep with a group of soldiers and announced to the staff that he was there to liberate them – but was informed that the German dignitaries who had been occupying the building had already left. Hemingway then commandeered the bar and ordered champagne for everyone.“When I dream of afterlife in heaven, the action always takes place in the Paris Ritz,” Hemingway would later say.With other Hemingway papers, A Room on the Garden Side has been housed in the Library of Congress and the John F Kennedy library in Massachusetts.Six decades after it was written, A Room on the Garden Side is set to be published in the summer edition of the Strand magazine, a literary quarterly that has previously published obscure works by the likes of Raymond Chandler, John Steinbeck and HG Wells.“Hemingway’s deep love for his favourite city as it is just emerging from Nazi occupation is on full display, as are the hallmarks of his prose,” Strand managing editor Andrew F Gulli writes in an editorial note introducing the story.Kirk Curnutt, a board member of the Hemingway Society, wrote in an afterword that “the story contains all the trademark elements readers love in Hemingway”.“Steeped in talk of Marcel Proust, Victor Hugo, and Alexandre Dumas, and featuring a long excerpt in French from Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal, the story implicitly wonders whether the heritage of Parisian culture can recover from the dark taint of fascism,” Curnutt wrote.War was a longtime muse for Hemingway. He worked as an ambulance driver during the first world war, drawing upon his experiences in A Farewell to Arms. The Spanish civil war inspired For Whom the Bell Tolls. He was both soldier and correspondent during the second world war, reporting on Paris’s liberation from Nazi occupation in August 1944 for Collier’s magazine.Numerous works were left unpublished after Hemingway killed himself in 1961. A Moveable Feast, his memoir of life in Paris in the 1920s, was published in 1964, three years after his death. Novels Islands in the Stream and The Garden of Eden were published in 1970 and 1986 respectively, and his non-fiction account of bullfighting The Dangerous Summer came out in 1985.During the last decade of his life, Hemingway wrote many other short stories set during the second world war. In August 1956, he told his publisher Charles Scribner Jr that he had completed five: A Room on the Garden Side, Black Ass at the Cross Roads, Indian Country and the White Army, The Monument, and The Bubble Reputation. Until now, only Black Ass at the Cross Roads had been published."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a32dbd55bf3aea1718ca5c0436d883afb2ff13e5/29_200_3458_2075/master/3458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131eee6dc14d25868f00d197bb8ceb93","title":"bank of england raises interest rates","story":"Monetary policy committee lifts cost of borrowing to highest level since 2009The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears about the economic impact of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously for the increase, judging that the economy had bounced back from a soft patch earlier this year triggered by the freezing weather and heavy snowfall from the “beast from the east”. While warning Brexit could blow the economy off course, the MPC said recent readings for economic growth “appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter”.Having made the call to move interest rates for only the third time in the past decade, the Bank’s latest decision comes amid growing fears over Brexit, with Theresa May facing parliamentary isions over her plan.Raising interest rates will mean higher borrowing costs on mortgages and loans for hard-pressed consumers and businesses as they adapt to Britain leaving the EU. John McDonnell MP, the shadow chancellor, said the rate rise would be bad news for hard-pressed households: “Given recent revelations that households are spending more than they receive in income for the first time since 1988, today’s rise will be a blow to those facing high levels of personal debt.”He added: “The Tories’ economic failure is making life difficult for families across the UK. They must change tack and end austerity once and for all.”The British Chamber of Commerce said the increase was ill-judged and could hit confidence in the economy. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said: “The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.”However, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at accountants PwC and a former MPC rate-setter, said the rate hike “makes sense both from a short-term perspective and in terms of a sustainable long-term monetary strategy”.Several economists had urged the Bank to keep rates on hold to help support jobs and growth amid the uncertainty.There has been some better news for the economy in recent months, with the summer heatwave and royal wedding giving the country a shot in the arm. Inflation has begun to fade from the highest level in five years, while unemployment also remains at the lowest level since the mid-1970s. However, factory output has slowed amid softer global economic growth, as Donald Trump has slapped import tariffs on some of the US’s biggest trading partners, including the EU and China. Despite the low levels of unemployment in the UK, pay rises for British workers also remain elusive. Having previously delayed raising interest rates in May, preferring to wait and see if the economy would recover as hoped, the decision to raise rates had been widely expected this time. However, the unanimous vote is likely to stoke speculation that further increases are around the corner.  Any future increases in the cost of borrowing are therefore likely to come at a “gradual pace and to a limited extent,” it added.

The number of housing transactions has declined and traditional estate agents are also under mounting pressure from online agencies.The company also revealed it had crashed £206m into the red over the most recent six months, as it was hit by £227m in one-off costs, mostly due to a writedown in the value of its assets and brand.Revenue and profit tumbled in all of its three major isions: sales and lettings, business to business and financial services.“The prime central London housing market continues to experience low levels of activity owing to political and economic uncertainty, particularly in relation to stamp duty and Brexit, which is felt more acutely in the capital,” it said.Countrywide issued its first profit warning in January, triggering the resignation of its chief executive Alison Platt.The company’s chairman, Peter Long, took over the day-to-day running of the business , juggling the job with several others. He is also vice-chair of travel group Tui and chair of Royal Mail, which suffered one of the biggest pay revolts in corporate history earlier this month.Long said the cash call would put Countrywide in the position to make good on a three-year “back to basics” recovery plan announced in March.“Although it is still very early in the turnaround, we are encouraged by the operational improvements that we are making and the tangible results that are being achieved,” he said.Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said Countrywide was in worse shape than its online and traditional rivals.“As a traditional operator, rather than a disruptive web-based rival like Purplebricks, Countrywide has lots of fixed costs relating to estate agency branches and staff which cannot immediately be taken out in response to weakening demand,” he said. “And, unlike its London-focused rival Foxtons, it also has lots of debt making it financially geared too. This creates a double whammy for the business as a softer property market has put a lot of pressure on the bottom line and made it increasingly difficult for it to service its borrowings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85a50b0baee17e81b3a43e0bfbbffdf81f0cb76a/0_230_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a20c32fb566885c6dbb30c496b2ac961","title":"interest rate rise the lack of dissenting voices came as a surprise","story":"Bank had been poised to act for some time but the unanimous vote raises eyebrowsThe Bank’s latest quarterly health check on the economy is almost identical to the one it produced in May.

One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping “Computer” from Apple’s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value.The Silicon Valley stalwart’s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S\u0026ampP 500’s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following.Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars.The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. More to follow....Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today’s rate rise is hard to justify:“The fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn’t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message.“The Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment  low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn’t made it easy to justify.”Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain’s buy-to-let lenders.Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today’s rate rise is a blow to the sector:“For many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.”“They wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.”One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today’s rate rise onto new tenants.Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced:Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by £50 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal.Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain’s equality watchdog last year, as we reported:The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson’s ban on “coloured” tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission.At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. “This policy clearly amounts to discrimination,” Polden said.“I find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.”Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today’s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy.However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.” Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today’s rate hike is a “punchy move”, given the uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the EU:Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state.In any case the Bank of England’s response in a few months’ time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren’t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn’t.”Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you’d expect after a rate hike.UK interest rates won’t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management.“We don’t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU.Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga.The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England’s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today.Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold.Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn’t support such unanimity:Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising.In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They’re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think.Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today’s rate rise. “It’s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates.Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE’s 25 basis points.Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds:For example, those paying off the UK’s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra £17-£18 per month, which adds up to an extra £200 per year or more than £6,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b0654f22a968d05e0a5fc4f7d3964ec99cc509/0_270_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=815be30bcaa526b9c8ad667d1088ad79","title":"bbc climate change deniers balance","story":"Like most Greens, I typically jump at opportunities to go on air. Pretty much any opportunity: BBC national radio, BBC TV, Channel 4, Sky – I’ve done them all over the years, for good or ill. Even when, as is not infrequently the case, the deck is somewhat stacked against me, or the timing inadequate for anything more than a soundbite, or the question up for debate less than ideal.But this Wednesday, when I was rung up by BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and asked to come on air to debate with a climate change denier, something in me broke, and rebelled. Really? I thought. This summer, of all times?So, for almost the first time in my life, I turned it down. I told it that I will no longer be part of such charades. I said that the BBC should be ashamed of its nonsensical idea of “balance”, when the scientific debate is as settled as the “debate” about whether smoking causes cancer. By giving climate change deniers a full platform, producers make their position seem infinitely more reasonable than it is. (This contributes to the spread of misinformation and miseducation around climate change that fuels the inaction producing the long emergency we are facing.)From a public service broadcaster, this is simply not good enough.What makes it so frustrating is that there are important debates to be had around climate change. And so I told the Beeb that I would be very happy to come on and take part in a different debate. For example, we should be debating whether the Paris climate accord is going to be enough, or if we need to do more. Or discussing just how radically our society needs to change to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, and how we should rethink our activism.But I will no longer put up with the absurd notion that a straight debate about the science can be justified, especially given the fundamental truth that we’ve known for decades: that even if there were any real room for doubt about the science, we should still take radical action to safeguard a liveable climate, on the basis of the Precautionary Principle. This principle of international law states that even the absence of certainty about the risk of widespread and catastrophic harm to the environment or public health ought not to stop us from taking preventive action to head off such potentially ruinous harms.BBC Cambridgeshire is based in Cambridge, the science capital of the UK. I expected better from it, especially after the well-publicised ruling this year that the way that the BBC has been promoting climate change deniers on air is no longer acceptable.In the end, the broadcast went ahead without me. Much of it wasn’t bad. The scientists interviewed were excellent. But the framing of the debate was awful, and framing is everything, so far as the message that most listeners receive is concerned. The presenter introduced the segment by asking, “Is climate change real?” The journalist doing vox pops bombarded ordinary people with canards such as, “Maybe it’s just a natural cycle?” And, of course, a climate change denier was given a huge and undeserved platform on an equal basis to his opponent.In August 2018, this is unacceptable and it seems that quite a lot of people agree with me.However, here’s the exciting thing. If we get more momentum behind the idea of refusing to participate, it will force a change of coverage methods by the BBC, which experts have been calling for for years. For if we all refuse to debate with the climate change deniers on public platforms, and press the BBC to catch up with the 21st century, it will be forced to change its ways, because the BBC cannot defend the practice of allowing a climate change denier to speak unopposed. If we truly want to see change on this issue, we need to be willing to let it know exactly how we feel. So, now I’m going to get on with filing my official complaint to the BBC …• Rupert Read teaches philosophy at the University of East Anglia and chairs the Green House thinktank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4801f9f3860eb54e89b95dad774bd80046eca69/0_141_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a254d83d5d2c5949bc2feff627dafd19","title":"brexit labour nec candidates jeremy corbyn","story":"Like some 550,000 other Labour party members, I have just opened the envelope with my ballot papers for the elections for Labour’s governing body, the all-important National Executive Committee (NEC), and for the 55-member National Policy Forum.Ordinary members elect nine NEC candidates from constituency Labour parties, while the rest of the seats go to trade unions, MPs, councillors and various party sections. Whether that’s the right balance is an arcane question for another day.What will strike members most forcefully as they read the candidates’ statements are the two sectarian slates from Momentum on the left and Labour First (“a network for Labour moderates”) on the right. My guess is that most ordinary members, unless tribally attached to those groups, will, like me, instinctively resent these slates. We all belong to one party, though that may be a tad naive since unity has been as rare as hens’ teeth in Labour’s 118-year history.But as free thinkers, most members won’t want to be told who to vote for, nor do they want to fixedly identify themselves with the left or right of the party. The age-old tug of war between radical ideas and how far you think voters can be pulled towards radical policies defines life on the left: that constant tussle between idealism and realism occurs within each member as much as it does between its left and right wings. How much redistribution, how much equality, how much tax-and-spend dare Labour offer, and which spending priorities should come first? No one knows how far you can go without risking yet another electoral failure – the bitter lifetime experience of most Labour members, most of the time.But there is something more shocking about the NEC candidates’ statements. There are 26 constituency Labour candidates, but only seven – seven! – mention Europe, and often only glancingly. Here we are in the midst of the greatest national existential crisis since the war, with the country ided and dangling over the edge of a precipice, months from committing mass hara-kiri over a fanatical Tory idea mendaciously missold in a referendum. And yet, 19 candidates have forgotten to give it even a passing mention.Naturally, they all write powerfully about the savage effects of austerity – something I write about almost weekly. But they write considerably more about internal Labour democracy than about Europe. Read these statements, and there is an overpowering sense of a navel-gazing party obsessing over its internal organs despite the fact that an imminent general election may be fought over the bones of the Brexit calamity. “My own priority will be democratising and reforming our party” is mirrored in many of them. Really?The NEC has shockingly mishandled the antisemitism scandal, which it should have stopped dead months ago. Instead, it prolonged it by defying the international definition of antisemitism. Last night Peter Willsman was, belatedly, dropped from Momentum’s slate. His statement doesn’t mention Europe, though it does boast that he has been Jeremy Corbyn’s friend for 41 years, as if nepotism was a qualification. That is partly why his extraordinary anti-rabbi rant at the NEC, recorded and revealed this week, was all the more shocking for not being cut off immediately by Corbyn and his allies.The only Momentum candidate to mention Europe is Jon Lansman – but in exactly the same dispiriting way that Corbyn used to speak about it, talking of “working with an anti-austerity alliance across Europe” – not the existing European Union we are actually breaking from. This reticence on Europe might signal Labour’s reasonable worries about holding its Brexit-voting seats, but the strongest impression is one of absent-mindedness.From most of these statements you can see why Labour’s opposition to Brexit has often been broken-backed, distracted and half-hearted. My own MP, shadow Brexit minister Keir Starmer, has been admirably rolling a stone uphill to get the party to where it is, with six principles that should prevent Labour agreeing to any form of Brexit damage. But too many in Labour, including its leaders, have treated it as a sideshow – which is bizarre, since Brexit chaos offers the best chance of Labour suddenly winning power.Best and most passionately anti-Brexit on the list is Eddie Izzard, who belongs to no one’s slate: “I am a proud British European. I am a strong pro-Europe voice on the NEC.” I would like to say that I picked candidates from across the slates, but no Momentum candidate mentioned Brexit. Only six of the nine Labour First “moderates” talk of fighting Brexit – and only they get my vote, plus Izzard and Ann Black, who alas doesn’t mention it, but is a longtime neither-slate and admirable NEC member diligently sending out her own unbiased record of each NEC meeting.What is dismal about the statements as a whole is the largely – not entirely – inward-looking sectarianism. After eight years of the worst government in living memory – which has ravaged public services, rendered the low paid poverty-stricken, dropped us from top of G7 growth to bottom as it takes us to the Brexit brink – there has never been a greater need for Labour. Every party member feels that, and is determined to get Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell into Downing Street. But Labour’s leaders need to sharpen their focus on the coming Brexit crunch that will get them there: still in his many speeches, Corbyn usually sidelines Brexit. Good grief, Labour should make mincemeat of a government reduced to talking of calling out the army to protect rationed food and medical supplies, while lorries block the motorways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/515da8e602a80e6f7733f44d3d8eab024cb95ba6/0_120_1632_978/master/1632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a42addd578915c2958d7f381e6319b51","title":"jeremy hunt foreign secretary tories capable one lets look evidence","story":"Mistaking his wife’s nationality is just the latest hapless blunder in the foreign secretary’s career. Yet No 10 is within his sights Difficult to know where to start, really. So perhaps it’s worth repeating, in full, the first paragraph of an AFP report from earlier this week:Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s new foreign secretary, has made an awkward debut in China when he sought to curry favour with his hosts by mentioning his Chinese wife, but accidentally referred to her as ‘Japanese’.”Your first question might well be: how? Seriously, how? And the answer is, simply: Jeremy Hunt.Becoming foreign secretary by replacing Boris Johnson – a man who thinks he is Winston Churchill but is actually Prince Philip – Hunt was supposed to make us less of a laughing stock on the world stage. He is meant to be the straight, serious man. But the truth is, if Hunt is the Tories’ best hope for aptitude and gravitas, they are in trouble. He has quite the history of gaffes, quirks and snafus. On Tuesday afternoon, as a social media mea culpa for wifegate, Hunt tweeted: “In Paris, choosing some flowers to bring back to Mrs H”. Might I suggest sakura, the national flower of Japan? But also, what’s with “Mrs H?” This is neither an affair during the 19th century, nor Mumsnet.Hunt has brought Mrs H, or Lucia Guo, as she is actually known, into the public eye once before. In fairness, that time he gets full points for getting her nationality correct, saying: “My wife is Chinese … are we going to be a country that is prepared to work hard in the way that Asian economies are prepared to work hard?” Which rather pissed off people in the UK. He didn’t piss people off quite as much as Labour’s Helen Goodman, however, whose response was: “If China is so great, why did Jeremy Hunt’s wife come to England?” That’s the thing about politics: put your foot in your mouth, and you can guarantee it won’t be too long before someone stuffs an entire leg into theirs.Other Hunt classics include: when he accidentally pulled the emergency stop cord in a train loo the time he posed for a photo in front of an entire whiteboard of confidential patient records, which he then tweeted and that glorious moment when he almost decapitated a woman when ringing a bell. He was also once: followed around a car park, in the rain, by a sousaphone player (thanks to television show, The Last Leg) followed again by a giant sousaphone player while crossing a road (The Last Leg again) presented with a giant, gold penis for being “Dick of the Year” (you spoil us, The Last Leg!) and was given an 8ft mock-up of a “statistics for dummies” book by a group of junior doctors. Oh, there’s also the time he bizarrely would only be interviewed standing up on Newsnight, which prompted presenter James O’Brien to comment afterwards, deadpan: “I should explain it was not my idea to conduct that interview both standing up: it was Mr. Hunt’s.” There’s the time Hunt oversaw the installation of a £44,000 bathroom suite, but then, who among us has not gone a bit Versailles with the renovations? Hunt did clarify that the bathroom was a communal one. Presumably so others could help him differentiate between a flush chain and an emergency cord.He’s a strange one, is Hunt. Apart from undermining an entire generation of NHS staff, pretty much ignoring what the Red Cross deemed a “humanitarian crisis” in our hospitals, and spending his Saturdays with a megaphone shouting: “WHY AREN’T YOU AT WORK?” into the faces of passersby – probably – he has sometimes come across as smart and, when not squirrelling out the back entrance of Richmond House to avoid protesters, pretty affable. Despite this, he’s still been followed around twice by a sousaphone player. It’s just not really the quality one looks for in a leader, is it? At the very least you want someone who is competent and respected. You don’t want the guy who, as culture secretary, should have been seriously scrutinising the Murdochs’ takeover bid for BSkyB instead of dancing the lambada – an actual, genuine hobby of Hunt’s for which he has a specially dedicated sprung room in his home, as revealed by Michael Gove (“Dance your stubborn best!”). By all accounts, by which I mean specifically the account that Hunt’s dance teacher once gave in an interview, the foreign secretary is very good. The Times calls him the “lambada king”. He even used to attend salsa classes at Pineapple Dance Studios, which puts him in the same category as a lot of early noughties reality television stars. Unclear whether he, too, used to wear a pastel-coloured velour tracksuit.I genuinely think it’s refreshing for politicians to have a passion, but how can one trust that Hunt has even remembered his passion correctly? He might turn around tomorrow and remember it’s actually the tango he loves. And what to do with a guy who, when the Conservatives decided to zhoosh up their Instagram page for conference, could only contribute by sitting slightly obscured behind a door with a nervous grin? Don’t worry, Kendall Jenner!It’s true, he has staying power. He became the longest-serving health secretary – although smugly tweeting the Twainesque “reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated” after clinging to his job when people were dying in hospital corridors, did not, I would suggest, strike the right tone. He has cannily positioned himself as a unity candidate, voting for remain, but now suggesting he would vote leave in a second referendum.But if Hunt, whose general appearance is of a vampire who’s just walked in on his own surprise birthday party, is the best the Tories have got, it just highlights the true farce that is the rest of government. Brexit means Brexit, even though nobody knows what Brexit means, and so nobody knows what means means and the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg seem intent on destroying all future prosperity and causing havoc in Northern Ireland. I suppose the one good thing about the prime minister, who read geography at university (be honest, you knew that even if you didn’t), is, well, she probably knows the difference between China and Japan.

Every writer meets their nemesis – mine was a think piece on the singer Pink.Each day I would sit at my laptop streaming Pink’s music and writing thousands of words – none of which was cohering into an argument. The piece was weeks late. And by Monday the bloated draft included quotes from John Howard, Andrew Breitbart and a random selection of 13-year-old Pink fans. It was a mess. Raise Your Glass played from the computer for the 105th time. I wanted to die.I tweeted: “Literally this th!nk piece on P!nk is going to be the death of me.”As I pressed send and I returned to the dreaded piece, something moved in my peripheral vision. Was it? No, it can’t be! Yes it was!An enormous python slithered from the between the slats in the gazebo where I was working and towards my laptop.I leapt back. The snake moved forward. A strange sound came out of my mouth. It was not the high-pitched shriek that I thought I would make on seeing a two metre-long python coming at me. It was more of a guttural yell, like I had been hit at close range in the face with a basketball.“Arrgh,” I yelled. “Arrghhh, help!”My aunt came running out. She thought something had gone wrong with my laptop and I had lost my Pink piece. By now the snake was casually flung across a chair and over the table, like one of Donald Trump’s very long ties.It moved noiselessly, even playfully around the table, and then back up the walls of the gazebo, wrapping itself around a decorative cabinet. The aesthetic effect of the snake against the cabinet was strangely pleasing (they matched) but the emotional effect of seeing such a large wild animal near my laptop was fear and disbelief.True Queenslanders, my aunt and uncle looked at the snake with nonchalance, as if it was a rainbow lorikeet or an ibis in their garden.No, they had not seen it before. Maybe it had come from the creek. Yes, it was big. I cowered behind them.“It’s harmless,” said my uncle. “Look, it’s just eaten.”The snake looked like it had swallowed a large possum. A bulge in its middle was preventing it from moving through the slats of the gazebo. Like a fat man trying to get into skinny jeans – it sort of gave up and just hung out there. Would it just stay in that position until it had shat out the possum?That’s if it was a possum ...Last year while travelling in Indonesia, I had become transfixed by a news story about a farmer who had been swallowed whole by a python. He had been missing for a while, when the python – with a suspiciously large lump in its body – was “spotted slithering awkwardly in Salubiro village”.It was captured, cut open and the man’s body was found inside fully clothed. Fully clothed!I thought about Pink. This was all her fault. I had tweeted: “Literally this th!nk piece on P!nk is going to be the death of me. And then a two-metre long python appears.”It was as if the snake was summoned, just like what happens in the Bible, when shit’s about to get real. Because a snake of course, is never just a snake. It’s a very powerful symbol that humans have used in storytelling and myth throughout the ages, not just as a metaphor but as a portent.“What do you portend, snake?” I asked.The snake did not move for a while, and my uncle assured me it was safe to continue working.Focusing on the Pink think piece was now impossible. I jumped at shadows, I looked at my handbag and thought I saw it moving.The sheer existence of the snake up in the eaves – digesting – was a fact that shook me somehow, like it was an apparition or holy vision that seemed unbelievable even though I was staring right at it. “Look at that snake,” I kept murmuring to no one in particular. “Just look at it.”I tweeted pictures of the snake and the ision on Twitter was sharp: there were those that replied in ALL CAPS that I should set the snake on fire or behead it with a shovel and those who said the snake was beautiful and unique, and I was very lucky to see one so close.For the next 24 hours I wandered outside, looked up at the snake – which had not moved – and would say aloud: “The snake – it’s still there.”“Look at the snake, its still there.”“I wonder if there are any road workers missing?”The snake had taken up residence not just in the gazebo but in my consciousness. My mate Trav, who is a real estate agent in Byron Bay, had told me, “Just wait until it shits everywhere. There’s one that lives in the garage of my vacant listing, it eats, then sleeps, then shits everywhere.”But over time my thinking about the python evolved. I stopped fearing it. It hadn’t given me the evil eye or hissed or shown any inclination that it might eat me.It was wild and beautiful, and although I shouldn’t touch it, I realised I shouldn’t be scared of it either.

That figure has since fallen as cases have been resolved, but campaigners say the affected students, many of whom have mental health problems, have suffered enormous stress and hardship.Becca Bland, the chief executive of Stand Alone, a charity that supports estranged people, said affected students had the third and final instalment of their maintenance and fee loans suspended. Some had to wait five months to have it reinstated, leading to extreme poverty, homelessness, defaults on tenancy agreements and a deterioration in their mental health.She described the anti-fraud exercise as ill-considered and heavy-handed. “Stand Alone understands the need to monitor fraud within the student population, but the vulnerabilities and characteristics of young adults who are estranged from their family must be taken into consideration in processes.“Students who are estranged from family suffer from extreme financial disadvantage whilst studying at university as they don’t have family support, and may have mental health difficulties linked to abuse, neglect or rejection from their family or the time they may have spent in the care system.“In this exercise, the actions of this fraud investigation have had negative consequences on students, who have had their funding cut off for many months, have been forced into homelessness or sofa surfing, and in some cases have dropped out of university.“It is both ethically and practically unacceptable to cut off a vulnerable student’s maintenance loan and fee loan prior to finding a student guilty of fraud. The idea of a financial institution monitoring a random sample of students’ social media to determine their family relationships is unsettling, and an invasion of their privacy.”James Smith, 20, quit his studies after his funding was suspended as a result of the fraud investigation. He denies doing anything fraudulent and feels that he has been treated like a criminal. He said he had been left with no choice but to give up his place studying zoology at Salford University, ending his dream of opening an animal sanctuary.He said the SLC had picked through his Facebook account in an attempt to find evidence of contact with his family, and had leapt to the wrong conclusions after finding a five or six word post. “I’m dropping out of university now. I’m not strong enough to be honest.,” he said. “I can’t even find the words to tell you how it’s made me feel. It’s been an absolute nightmare. My house mates were worried when they saw me not eating and not sleeping. It’s all I think about. It’s had a dramatic effect on me. I feel like I’ve been persecuted.” An SLC spokesperson said that as a result of the anti-fraud exercise one student had had all funding removed after submitting a fraudulent estrangement letter, five students would no longer receive the additional estrangement element of their funding, three voluntarily withdrew their application for estrangement funding before the process started and one withdrew during the process.“There are currently 34 students who have not yet responded to our requests for information and, as a result, we have withheld the third instalment of their maintenance and fee loans,” the spokesperson said. “We would ask them to please call us on 0141 243 3324 as soon as possible to allow us to review their evidence and future funding.”Stand Alone has called for an urgent review of the investigation and the reinstatement of funding to those who have been cut off without any proof of fraud.A spokesperson for the National Union of Students said: “The number of students applying for estrangement status is low and at every opportunity the SLC should remain sensitive to the situation these students find themselves in and refrain from overzealous responses.“It is also critical that appropriate means of communication and language are used and that students are directed to sources of support to avoid confusion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c67313977c046259c4dceb662f83cf07bf5ab465/157_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7feb075ea894b42847d73189e05bb8","title":"if beale street could talk barry jenkins moonlight","story":"Oscar-winner’s James Baldwin adaptation tipped for further awards glory once it premieres at the Toronto film festivalBarry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning writer-director of Moonlight, has revealed the trailer for his much-anticipated new film If Beale Street Could Talk.It’s an adaptation of James Baldwin’s 1974 novel and Jenkins shared the first footage on Twitter to coincide with what would have been the author’s 94th birthday. The plot follows Tish and Fonny, a couple torn apart by a false rape accusation. As Tish prepares to give birth to her child, she must find evidence to free Fonny.It stars newcomer Kiki Layne and Race star Stephan James as the central duo, with Chi-Raq’s Tayonnah Parris, The Leftovers’ Regina King and Atlanta’s Bryan Tyree Henry in support. Jenkins wrote the screenplay at the same time as he wrote Moonlight in 2013.Jenkins’ critically acclaimed drama about the life of a gay man in Miami became the first film with an all-black cast and an LGBT lead to win the best picture Oscar in 2017. Jenkins also won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay with Tarell Alvin McCraney, who he showed an early cut of Beale Street to earlier this year.“Tarell made this beautiful comment after seeing a cut of the film,” Jenkins said in April. “He’s like: ‘Oh, you made this New York. It’s not a New York of places. It’s a New York of faces.’ I think the faces that existed in the time of Baldwin are still present in the New York I see today and the New York that we made this film.”In 1974, Baldwin spoke to the  about his book. “Every poet is an optimist,” he said to Hugh Hebert.

When Hasselbaink thinks back to the youngster who joined him at Chelsea in 2001, he recalls a footballer with a good shot, decent technique and some pace. “He tackled all right,” the Dutchman says. “I think if you look at his abilities, there was nothing really outstanding.”Hasselbaink, however, is in the middle of paying Lampard a glowing compliment. The point he wants to get across is how hard Derby County’s manager worked to become one of the finest footballers of his generation.“Everything together made him an exceptional player,” the former Chelsea striker says. “He came from West Ham and we had some big names in the team but it didn’t faze him. He wanted to show he was worth the money. Mentally, he was one of the strongest players ever. Nothing really knocked him back. That will be a good asset for him as a manager. You have to have a thick skin.”Tony Carr, West Ham’s former academy director, has similar memories of a kid with an iron will to succeed. “When challenges have come along, Frank has always risen to it and kicked on,” Carr says. “I’m sure he’ll take that trait into management. There’s lots he won’t be able to control when they’re out on the pitch but I’m sure his attitude will always help him.“As a young player, he was a breath of fresh air. A lot of youngsters can be apathetic about training hard, being patient and working on their weaknesses. Frank was always looking for ways to improve, whether it was fitness or technical work, and as he got more senior the managers he played for allowed him to become more versed in the tactical side of the game.”Carr bumped into Lampard a few weeks before his appointment by Derby and the meeting left him with an inkling his former student was ready to make the leap into management. Lampard spoke about completing his coaching badges and helping Jody Morris coach Chelsea’s under-18s. A few weeks later the 40-year-old was asking Morris to become his No\u0026nbsp2 at Derby, who had just missed out on promotion to the Premier League after losing their play-off semi-final to Fulham.Hasselbaink, who has managed at Burton Albion, Queens Park Rangers and Northampton Town, believes Morris will be an important ally for Lampard. “I played with Jody and he had a lot of football intelligence,” he says. “He wanted to play in a continental way. He is astute, a student of the game and very single-minded on how football should be played.“He has learned his trade at Chelsea, so it should be a good fit. They have played together and trust each other. That’s what you need as a manager: people who have your back and who can transmit your ideas to the players every day.”One challenge for Lampard will be accepting Derby’s players may not possess his talent. Hasselbaink knows there will have to be compromises at times. “But I can see him succeeding because he is calm and knows what he wants. He will not sit back and wait for it to come to him. He will go and get it. He has played under a lot of great managers, so tactically he has learned a lot. It is about how he will communicate that to his players now.“You see managers struggle to accept players with lesser ability. They might not have the patience and struggle to understand why a player can’t do something. But Frank is a smart guy who thinks things through. He will know what to expect.“When you become a manager, you go from being a student to a teacher. You have to think about everything: the players, the fans, the board, your staff and then you have to combine it all. You don’t turn up at 9.30am, train at 10.30am and go home at 1pm.“You turn up at 7am, make sure training is prepared, take the training. Then you assess what has gone right and wrong. Then it’s about planning for the next day. Before you know it, it’s the end of the day. It’s totally different. But he won’t go into this with his eyes closed, he’ll be fine.”Lampard, who begins with a trip to Reading on Friday night, will be expected to challenge for promotion despite his inexperience. He has taken a risk in his first job. “But why not go where you have the opportunity to go for promotion?” Hasselbaink says. “That’s the kind of animal he is – he needs that edge, that feeling that he’s playing for something. The pressure won’t trouble him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c304110bffd8a98ec1cf3cc7506f4d4307479c57/0_253_4491_2695/master/4491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c3d7a1a58e6696462e34358eec25ff2","title":"premier league preview 2018 19 everton marco silva","story":"After the chaotic reign of Ronald Koeman and the brief one of Sam Allardyce stability is badly needed at Goodison, but does Marco Silva’s recent track record suggest he is the solution? writers’ predicted position: 7th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 250-1“A big project and a big challenge for us as a technical staff” was how Marco Silva described his new job at Everton eight weeks ago. The scale of the challenge has been exposed before the Premier League season begins. As for the big project Farhad Moshiri envisaged when he bought into the club two years ago, the realisation is further away than ever.Everton have serious problems as a team and club at the start of yet another new era, this one with Silva and the director of football, Marcel Brands, the latter lured from PSV Eindhoven after helping the Dutch side lift three Ereisie titles in four seasons.The summer has yielded more worrying performances than necessary additions to a flawed squad. Richarlison, signed from Silva’s former club Watford for a princely £40m, and the Barcelona left-back Lucas Digne are the only new faces. The need for more was underlined during heavy pre-season defeats against the Championship newcomers Blackburn Rovers and the French side Rennes. Neither slow transfer business nor poor performances constitute a surprise, however. They are as Brands predicted.“I will try to build a structure for a long-term relationship,” said the influential 56-year-old in June. “It will go step by step and it will not go every time as everyone wants, but finally we will achieve the goals we want.” A priority, he admitted, was to drastically reduce an inflated wage bill and a squad of 38 players.Cleaning up the mess of the damaging Ronald KoemanSteve Walsh era has consumed the summer. It has been a trying process, with players such as Davy Klaassen having been on a contract worth over £100,000 a week, and it is far from complete.A recovery could be painfully slow and patience has not been a virtue of Moshiri or exasperated fans in recent years. Silva’s supply appears limited, too. The 40-year-old’s head was turned by Everton four months into his debut season at Watford and he has not spent more than a year at any of his past four clubs. Yet he must restore stability and unity while improving players he has inherited, a basic requirement that has proven beyond Everton’s recent managers.The high managerial turnover – Silva’s is the fifth voice Everton players will have heard in just over two years if David Unsworth’s caretaker reign is included – has inevitably left a disjointed and uncertain team.For the second summer in succession Everton have parted company with their leading goalscorer and not replaced him. Last year it was Romelu Lukaku and now Wayne Rooney, for reasons the former England captain is clearly unhappy about. Rooney may not have been as crucial as the Belgium striker to Everton’s style of play or chances of challenging the leading pack, but his 11 goals and an intelligence on the ball that few teammates could rival vindicated the decision to return to his boyhood club.True, his goals all arrived before Christmas and at times it appeared Koeman, Unsworth and Sam Allardyce were trying to shoe-horn him into imbalanced teams. But, as with Lukaku, the qualities he brought have not been replaced.Rooney and his agent, Paul Stretford, approached Moshiri towards the end of last season to discuss Everton activating the one-year option on his contract for 2019‑20. That may have been optimistic, albeit necessary when planning the future, but the pair were taken aback by Moshiri’s response that he had received several offers for Rooney and they should consider them. Cutting the wage bill was again at play, with Rooney earning £150,000-a-week from Everton before moving to DC United on a three-year deal with no transfer fee involved.Goalscoring has been a long-term problem and the onus will be on Cenk Tosun, an Allardyce purchase, to show not only why he was signed for up to £27m from Besiktas but that he meets Silva’s requirements for a front man. The only alternatives are Oumar Niasse, Sandro Ramírez and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, the latter one of several young players Everton must hope will only benefit from last season’s gruelling experience.The four strikers scored a combined 17 league goals last season. Richarlison, Theo Walcott and Ademola Lookman, providing he stays having enjoyed a successful loan spell at RB Leipzig last season, must also improve Everton’s threat from the flanks.The same applies to Gylfi Sigurdsson in the No 10 role. The Iceland international had a mediocre campaign following his club record £45m arrival from Swansea, although being played out of position on the left by Koeman, an unfathomable decision by a manager obsessed with making Sigurdsson a vital cog in his team last summer, offers ample mitigation. With Rooney and Klaassen sold, the Dutchman for half the £24m Everton paid Ajax last summer– another disastrous Koeman decision – the path is clear for Sigurdsson to become what his former manager envisaged and the club paid for.Throughout the spine of the team there are deficiencies – with the notable exception of the England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford – but it is Silva’s defensive options that explain his desire to strengthen both at left-back and in central defence.It is also a vulnerable foundation, one easily exposed by pace and also hinders a manager’s wish to play a high line. Michael Keane has not demonstrated he can help correct those flaws since his £30m move from Burnley last summer.Team spirit and a connection between the fans and players is also lacking at Goodison. Managerial upheaval is not the only contributory factor. The completely joyless football served up during Allardyce’s brief reign was a major cause of the disconnect last season. That appointment turned out as badly as the vast majority at Everton expected.The worrying exceptions were Moshiri and two members of the board who have taken on more prominent positions after a boardroom reshuffle this summer, Sasha Ryazantsev and Keith Harris. The one-game England manager’s style on and off the pitch alienated him from the Goodison crowd but there was no argument with Coleman’s withering assessment in June that the players were also responsible for Everton’s regression.By the end of this season it will be 24 years since Everton won a trophy. That would equal the worst drought in the club’s history, set between 1939 and 1963, and the second world war accounted for six of those years. Silva’s challenge appears formidable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeac042a9f564e279a2a99b781ce496b27b8c2f4/891_583_5016_3008/master/5016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47e2dc7e9a82b6c9f567b35928ea878","title":"auf wedersehen britain brexit forcing my german family leave home","story":"Alexander Menden enjoyed his dream job in London, his wife working in the NHS, their boys supporting England in the World Cup. But the disaster that is Brexit has changed all that‘So you’re going home.” This is something I hear a\u0026nbsplot when I tell people that my wife and I have decided to move to Germany after 14 years of living in London. My reply is always the same: “Actually, we are leaving our home. This is our home.” We are moving to a country that my wife and I were born in and are citizens of, but which our children know only as a holiday destination. There was – and is – no burning desire on our part to live in Germany. I never missed the impoliteness, control freakery and permanent moaning that I associate with much of German public life.There is, however, a definite urge to leave Britain, a country that has lost its way and, with it, many of its best qualities. In public discourse, pragmatism, level-headedness and tolerance (or at least benevolent indifference) have been largely replaced by uncompromising partisanship. The result of the EU referendum dismayed me, but did not surprise me. Ever since my time at Oxford University in the mid-90s, I had been aware of the deeply entrenched anti-EU sentiment, especially among politics graduate students – some of whom would go on to work with pro-Brexit politicians and in the\u0026nbspmedia.What that time did not prepare me for was the absurd spectacle that post-referendum British politics has mutated into. There seems to be no fudge, no disaster, no incompetence to which Britain’s current, distressingly myopic and feckless batch of politicians refuse to stoop, be they in government or opposition. The unworkable white paper thrashed out at Chequers, and the resignations, parliamentary chaos and no-deal threats resulting from it, have thrown the current level of ineptitude in British politics into sharp relief.After the referendum, there was a\u0026nbspshift in my journalistic remit. Before, I had what I will always consider the best job imaginable – reporting on the arts for the Süddeutsche Zeitung from the most culturally exciting and erse city in the world. It was every arts journalist’s dream: I covered everything from the Turner\u0026nbspprize to the Booker prize and interviewed artists such as Anish Kapoor, Ian McKellen and the Rolling Stones.Since 24 June 2016, however, my job has been wall-to-wall Brexit coverage. I would not have been doing it properly if it had been any different. From a British perspective, it is the defining topic of our era, even though many Brits seem to prefer to ignore it, hoping it will just go away. In the run-up to the implementation of article 50 in March 2017, for instance, I started writing a daily “Countdown” column covering stories such as the diminished “Brexit Toblerone” to the harassment of our Polish friends after the referendum – and tracing how my perception of Britain had been changed by the result.Brexit even made its way into arts coverage – for example, the National Gallery’s attempt to buy a painting by Jacopo da Pontormo from a US banker was scuppered by the slump in sterling, while the European Union Youth Orchestra, which had always had its headquarters in London, was forced to move to Italy.My journeys outside the London bubble, before as well as after the referendum, made me aware of the broad spectrum of reasons for the Brexit vote, as well as of the fallout that is already happening, or is on the horizon. They showed me a Britain that is ided and directionless. Yet,\u0026nbsplooking at much of the domestic coverage, you would not know this. In most British media, journalists seem biased and underinformed in equal measure – and peddle the “will of the people” line unchallenged. One of the untruths repeated unquestioningly is the British government’s assertion that the status of the 3 million EU-citizens in this country is secure. Despite official protestations, it is still unclear what this status will be after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. If the “settlement scheme” that the home secretary, Sajid Javid, has announced goes ahead, we would at best have to apply and pay to secure as a privilege something that free movement has so far guaranteed. Free movement is neither a privilege nor some kind of transactional immigration deal. It is a reciprocal arrangement between EU member states, which formed the legal basis of our move to Britain all those years ago. It has been changed unilaterally by the British government. We had no say in it.Being used as bargaining chips for two years and then allowed to stay in our home for a fee, turning from citizens into supplicants, is hardly a democratic process – even though, currently, it is the best-case scenario. The assertion that “nothing’s agreed until everything’s agreed”, recently reiterated by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, makes it clear that, should there be a no-deal Brexit, all of this would be irrelevant. At worst, we could be stuck in Britain with no legal status at all. In the light of all this, it is surely better to jump than wait to be pushed.To those who are tempted to reassure us that “it won’t happen”, I\u0026nbspcan only say: look at the many instances over the past few years where you said the same, and then precisely that thing happened. Of course, Germany has its own problems. In her capricious interior minister, Horst Seehofer, Angela Merkel now has her own Boris Johnson-type loose cannon. However, in Germany at least we won’t be totally politically disenfranchised. EU citizens had no say in any of the Brexit decisions – Commonwealth citizens living in the\u0026nbspUK were allowed to participate in\u0026nbspthe EU referendum, we weren’t and we never had the vote in parliamentary elections. What our status would be in local elections (which we have been able to vote in so far) is up in the air, as everything is still legally unclear.I imagine reactions to our departure will range from, “Oh, but we didn’t mean people like you” to “Good riddance, you won’t be missed”. To the former, I would reply: it doesn’t matter the damage is done. Brexit will affect all EU citizens in the UK (and UK citizens in the EU) equally, and you don’t get to pick and choose. I do, however, tend to agree with the latter. The country won’t suffer terribly from having one fewer foreign arts journalist. It will be harder to replace the rest of my family, though. My sons – 13, 11, and seven years old – have dual citizenship but are all UK-born and have never lived outside Cricklewood, north-west London. All three were among the best students in their respective classes. They are rooted in Britain, and have visited (and in some cases been dragged to) more National Trust and English Heritage sites than you can shake a stick at.When a young and very likable England team beat Colombia in their World Cup penalty shoot-out, my sons were delighted about the win. These were English boys supporting England. My children never had to choose between their German and British “identities” – a choice which I still hope they will never have to make. They have been very understanding about the reasoning behind the move. That doesn’t change the fact that they are leaving behind all their friends and, after a life shaped by the multiculturalism of one of the world’s great metropolises, now they will have to get used to an environment that is very different. For example, during our visit to his new school in Germany, one of my sons remarked, with some incredulity: “This is so weird – all the students are white!”My wife, meanwhile, is leaving behind her post as a paediatric consultant at a London hospital. It was her firm belief in the egalitarian principles of the National Health Service, as well as the excellent medical training, that brought us to Britain in 2004. Her skillset and expertise, which she was fully committed to offer the NHS for the rest of her career, will now be applied elsewhere, just like those of many other excellent healthcare professionals from the EU.Having listened to myself talking about all of this quite passionately to\u0026nbspa British friend, I asked him: “Am\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspoverthinking this?” “No,” he\u0026nbspsaid. “You are overfeeling it.” I\u0026nbsphave never considered myself an Anglophile hopefully, my response to this complex nation has been more nuanced than uncritical adoration. But perhaps my friend was right. Our response to Brexit is as much emotional as a practical. Isn’t that correct, though, considering that the leave vote was entirely rooted in emotion? It is not easy to stay calm and rational when faced with the visceral, self-aggrandising, jingoistic drivel that flows endlessly from some in the leave camp. It is painful to see how Britain, particularly England, has bought into its own imperial, nostalgic myth and is now falling prey to the resulting delusions.The discrepancy between the Brexit people thought they voted for\u0026nbspand the one they will get reminds me a little of the story of Boaty McBoatface: “The people” voted to give that name to a 125-metre-long, state-of-the-art research vessel with a top speed of 17 knots and a helipad. What they got was a tiny, remote-controlled, unmanned, bright yellow submersible that looks like a suppository. Yet Boaty McBoatface, as disappointing as it may look, is much more useful than any form of\u0026nbspBrexit. I would be delighted if this\u0026nbspgreat project of national self-harm were not to happen. Unfortunately, I\u0026nbspthink it will, and we want to be gone when it does. For whatever shape Brexit takes, it will inevitably be worse than what we – what all of\u0026nbspus – had before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76fd446bc2307d799e498f04edb432cbf47833b9/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b613656641a2920ec933382313b30069","title":"womad visa fiasco brexit britain live music festival","story":"This isn’t the first time esteemed overseas artists have been refused entry to the UK for a festival. The Home Office is killing our world music scene – and it’s going to get worseThe UK has long been a leading destination for discovering sounds from far-flung corners of the globe, whether it is Malian songbird Oumou Sangaré’s set at Glastonbury, or the shadowy South African electro of DJ Lag in a sticky-floored club in London. But last weekend, that reputation was thrown into disarray following comments by Womad organiser Chris Smith, who lambasted the UK’s oppressive visa restrictions on world music artists. Three of the acts scheduled for the festival – Sabry Mosbah from Tunisia, Wazimbo from Mozambique and some of the members of Niger’s Tal National – were denied entry to the UK and either had to cancel their festival appearance or perform stripped-down sets. Indian duo Hashmat Sultana passed through border control 24 hours after they were due to go on stage. Smith said that an increasing number of performers were now declining invitations to the event because they deemed the Home Office’s iron-fisted process humiliating.Questions have been raised about what this means for the future of world music in the UK. The festival’s co-founder, Peter Gabriel, this week released a statement calling the situation “alarming” and asked: “Do we really want a white-breaded, Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?” Channel 4 News’s Jon Snow, meanwhile, tweeted: “The ‘hostile environment’ took its toll at Womad … a number of events were seriously affected by visa refusals. By definition, a festival of world music requires visas for many bands. What on Earth is the Home Office doing refusing them? Is music the new enemy?”From booking agents and gig promoters to festival curators and artists themselves, many have had disheartening experiences trying to bring esteemed musicians into the country. Each time, they must navigate a confusing matrix of box-ticking processes via outsourced application centres only for a visa to be refused regardless, causing gigs to be cancelled at the last minute and money lost.“It’s definitely the toughest country to enter,” says Ben Makkes, manager for the 82-year-old Ghanaian highlife pioneer Ebo Taylor, denied a visa last year despite playing in the UK many times during his 60-year career. During his application, the visa office kept his band’s passports for weeks, meaning they couldn’t travel elsewhere in Europe, missing vital shows. “There was no communication, no help whatsoever,” says Makkes. “The reason they eventually gave us was insufficient funds on accounts, even though my company had stated that we would cover all costs. In the end we lost €20,000 (£17,000) in flights and fees, and I don’t think we’ll come back to the UK because of that.”That despair is reiterated by many artists abroad. The Serbian DJ Tijana T told dance music site Resident Advisor she felt “like a criminal” after having her UK visa denied three times last year. Booking agent Clementine Bunel agrees that artists find it “demoralising”, while Seun Kuti, son of Afrobeat legend Fela, said on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show last week: “What we musicians go through is hell”.The UK visa process for entertainers does indeed sound like a gift from Satan himself. It is eye-wateringly complex, costly (£245 slow-track much more for premium fast-track) and certainly not user-friendly. Steve Richard, of entertainment specialists T\u0026ampS Immigration Services, explains that applicants must fill out an online form, containing sections that are “not entirely clear”, followed by a personal appearance at a visa application centre. “Some people will live near a VAC but many won’t, particularly in Africa,” says Richard. “Applicants from Mali, for example, have to travel to Dakar in Senegal for their nearest VAC”, and trips such as these, which can be about 1,000 miles each way, for 15 band members can cost several thousand pounds.“It’s an absolute scandal,” says Paul Duhaney, director of Liverpool’s annual Africa Oyé festival. “It’s like me having to go to the USA, but going to Moscow to get my visa. I just wouldn’t do it. So why are we expecting African artists, or artists from anywhere for that matter, to go to another country for interviews?”Performers invited by a number of approved events such as Womad (there are 45 in the UK in total) can apply for a permit-free festival visitor visa without the need to issue a certificate of sponsorship. But they must “provide bank statements showing a consistent balance of around £1,000 for at least three months,” says Richard. Even these visas are clearly no longer guaranteed, often due, according to David Jones, a director at live music producer Serious, to spiralling processing times. “What used to be the absolute maximum period they would turn the visa around in, 15 working days, has become the norm.” Often this means that passports are returned long after a gig has taken place.According to Richard, visa officers “don’t always appreciate that the simple fact an artist is popular in the UK is reason enough that they should want to do a show here”. Duhaney agrees: many of these bands have “played to 40,000 people in their own country. It’s like Robbie Williams going to Ghana and they’re saying: ‘Who are you? Not really sure we can let you in, mate.’” These refusals seem to be more common than ever in the past year, adds Richard. And it is taking its toll on event programming.“We have four bands on reserve just in case of last-minute visa issues, because it happens every year. It’ll happen in the years going forward,” says Duhaney. “This could seriously affect all UK festivals, if this continues.”Alison Phipps, a language professor at Glasgow University and a Unesco chair in refugee integration, says: “It is an extraordinarily difficult thing to bring a musician into the country,” and that “undoubtedly, since 2015, it has got considerably harder”. In 2017, she booked 22 musicians and dancers from Ghana to perform as part of a £2m UK government-funded academic project at Solas festival. At first, 20 were denied visas. “We’ve done this in the past and we’ve never had a problem,” says Phipps, but this time “they received letters and refusals saying that the Home Office did not believe that they were musicians, that they were working with me on this project. We’re funded by the government to do this work, and then the same government refuses us permission to do it.”After appealing, with the help of her local MPs, all but two of Phipps’s invitees were let in. But not before flights had been rebooked for thousands of pounds. Whether it is official or not, Phipps says, “there is a travel ban in place in the UK. What I see constantly is that if you are from the global south, you will be refused almost invariably.”Brian d’Souza, who performs as the musician Auntie Flo, met one of the key collaborators on his next album, Senegal’s Mame n’Diack Seck Thiam, while in Amsterdam. One of their tracks, Mame’s Story, details Seck Thiam’s difficulties getting a visa to perform at a BBC World Service event at the 2017 Edinburgh International festival.“There seems to be a very colonialist attitude when it comes to presuming underlying motivations for the artists I’m trying to book,” says d’Souza. “It’s saying: ‘If they come to the UK, they’ll just end up staying.’ But most of the artists I’ve ever worked with are here to do a job, and then they’re quite happy to go back to their own homes they’re not desperate to come and live in the UK. They are performers, they’re not trying to emigrate.” Examples such as the nine members of the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians, granted asylum in 2017, are in a minority. Most musicians’ work is rooted in where they live, and they have no desire to move – something underlined by often decades of touring without any attempt at illegal immigration.Was Jon Snow right, then, when he said that the hostile environment is in effect for touring musicians? “Perhaps, but it’s hard to say this is deliberate,” says Richard. “From how we see it, most of these problems seem to stem from their processes not working very efficiently.” Jones also suggests that it is down to administrative incompetence, as a result of cost-cutting. “I don’t think there’s someone sitting inside the immigration authority who’s going: ‘Let’s be racist,’” says Jones. “But instead of being a system that isn’t quite working in the face of government cutbacks, and it’s just bumbling inefficiency and a nuisance, it’s become something that’s been perceived in a different light. Because of Brexit and belligerent statements about ‘reclaiming our borders’. Really, this process has been eroding over time.”Brexit rhetoric might not help Britain’s image as a cultural nexus. But how it will exacerbate the current climate for touring musicians – as well as artists of all other kinds – remains to be seen. Richard says it is unlikely to affect those from countries already on the visa list, but what about those from the EU? A recent report published on 26 July by the House of Lords’ European committee about the movement of people in the cultural sector suggested that the government should offer a “multi-country, multi-entry, short-term touring visa for EU citizens,” and vice versa. But changes have already started to come into play on some borders – and without warning. American artists who would once fly to Ireland to play shows and then go on to the UK without an entry visa now require one to enter the UK, says Richard, “whereas if they enter from any other country, they just need a paper permission, not a visa”.What it could mean for the future, he continues, is that “non-EU acts are less likely to play shows in Ireland. Bands may deem that slotting a Dublin show into their tour is too troublesome.”While Jones estimates that fewer tours are likely to be undertaken in the UK by artists needing visas, he says that he won’t be discouraged from booking them. “That sense of keeping international links wide open has never felt more important in my lifetime.” He says a solution would be simply to “trust” the festivals on the permit-free list who have signed up to take responsibility for the artists they have invited to Britain. Others suggest a specialist for the entertainment sector within the Home Office who can distinguish between genuine and non-genuine acts, and an independent organisation who can advise on forms.If the current situation is not reviewed and improved, however, “everything is going to get a lot harder”, says Phipps. “The UK will be isolated.” Artists, she says, “bring us in to a relationship with difference. They play a line of music we’ve not heard before and we welcome it and our lives are enriched – and then we begin to learn it and then we sing it. What we are doing with Brexit, with the closing of the borders, with all of this focus on a hostile environment, is trying to make our lives dull and stupid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46fb8c0877d3f91570126c2bc91b88e2fa1da4d/0_1784_3641_2184/master/3641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a995b3b038e3c88cb9d1122bb2a1cbdb","title":"meriel armitages recipe for jackfruit carnitas","story":"Get your hands dirty with these vegan-friendly treats inspired by offerings found in Mexico CityMexican food is all about using your hands, piling up a lot of napkins on the table and getting messy – it takes the formality out of hosting dinner parties and saves on the washing up.

It is Instagram-friendly, has a daft name and is rooted in deep and meaningful culinary history that it plays on in order to fill a need which didn’t exist before.Before you ask – and I did – bubblewrap waffles are indeed named because of their resemblance to the packaging. Every so often Sunny Wu, founder of Bubblewrap in London’s Chinatown, will receive a phone order for a metre-long roll of packaging.It opened in 2015, first as a stall and last year as a bricks and mortar shop. Shortly after opening, Wu lost her voice because she had to explain the history to every customer. Back then, she was selling two a day, sometimes none. Now, over a weekend, it’s hundreds Wu has considered live-tweeting the queue.To understand the egg waffle – to use its proper name – is to understand its provenance. The most commonly held theory suggests egg waffles, or gai daan jai, were street food items first sold in Hong Kong in the early 1950s. They were originally conceived as a way of using up broken eggs, with people adding them to flour, milk and sugar to create a batter. These waffles used to be made on a hexagonal waffle iron and cooked on charcoal. Where they came from before that is open to debate, but Wu believes they were inspired by European waffles – “it was a colony after all” she trills, with some irony – with the recipe travelling and morphing from west to east and back again. When Hong Kong entered its period of economic reform, eating habits branched out – eating waffles became less about survival and more about pleasure.Here, pleasure certainly abounds each warm waffle is rolled into a cone and filled with ice-cream, fruit, sauce and nuts. The taste is akin to a regular waffle, except lighter, with a slightly sweeter crust. The bubbles don’t pop so much as melt. In the past few weeks, Wu created a vegan version, made with linseed instead of egg, and all toppings vegan, too. Bubblewrap sells this vegan variety on Fridays, so as not to contaminate the waffle irons. I have yet to taste a vegan alternative of anything so close to the original. It is slightly softer in texture, but otherwise Wu is either a scientist or a witch.In an age when Instagram is considered to be the first and final symbol of millennial navel-gazing, and “bad vegans” – those who adopt the diet for superficial reasons – are seriously frowned upon, it is refreshing to meet someone who doesn’t seem to care what people think if she embraces both. Wu joined Instagram the year it launched, and has even hallmarked her own shot in which customers hold the bubblewrap up in front of Wardour Street’s Ching dynasty-designed gate, as if the batter alone has been marketed for peak Instagrammability. “Most people order strawberry and Oreo because the colours work,” she says. “Why not?” she shrugs. “It’s fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/472b4742d54ec3caf13c0d7894b5737f212c76e6/1_0_5330_3200/master/5330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05110bac0e946219d847b392603b6dd3","title":"what we learned summer holiday jobs","story":"Can summer work be life-enhancing? Writers, politicians and musicians share what they learned in the laundrette, behind the bar – or cleaning earwax off hearing aidsEsther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, believes young people taking a summer job is “connected to having a successful future … They can help people develop their customer service and problem-solving skills, build their resilience and attitude to work, as well as improve time management and the ability to juggle different priorities.” Last week, she launched a campaign “to make the case for part-time, Saturday and summer jobs”. She fondly recalled her own student holiday job as a waitress, and said it had directed her away from the law and towards a job in the media.I was at university in the 1970s, when people were less likely to have a holiday job. I remember signing on but never got offered any work – thank God, I thought at the time. Reading about the summer jobs recalled here makes me feel I missed out – I could have done with a few of those life-enhancing experiences rather than lying on the sofa watching cricket on TV or idly flicking through textbooks on Anglo-Saxon history. I comprehensively failed the McVey initiative test. Even if you hate your holiday job, it’s still worth doing because, as one student about to embark on his second vacation job told me recently: “Holiday jobs might not be good at showing you what you want to do in life, but they can be brilliant at showing you what you don’t want to do.” As some of the writers below discovered.Musician and cheesemakerI had dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station. I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months. It was incredibly hard, repetitive work. The manager was an ex-army major: very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing. There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for “shoplifter spotted”, at which point all the male floor staff were required to assemble at till No 1 to tackle the suspect – who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle – a project I’m still working on.Ah, the unforgettable summer of 2003, which I spent working for a hearing-aid company on an industrial park on the outskirts of Stockport. I remember my induction well. My line manager cheerfully handed me a box of rejected hearing aids, a pair of latex gloves and a bottle of disinfectant: I had to clean the earwax from them. If you’re feeling slightly nauseous at this image, try doing it.Phone calls with would-be customers were a challenge, what with them ringing for assistance with their hearing. Somewhat bleaker was that these cheap aids were pretty rubbish and it was all just a data-farming exercise to try to rip off mostly ageing consumers with more expensive products. Widows would ring, tearfully begging me to stop sending their late husbands promotional material for useless gadgets. So what did I learn from this particular summer job? Not much, other than confirming my suspicion that late-capitalism sucks.In 1991, it was perfectly possible to finish your A-levels, walk into a restaurant on Chancery Lane with just about enough experience to tell a bread roll from a complicated napkin, and score a job as a waitress – but it came at a price. Any demeaning wheeze they cooked up would fall to the idiot, and so it was that at precisely 3pm, I had to go from table to table, asking QCs whether they wanted a dessert wine. It had to be dessert wine. I wasn’t allowed to say: “Anything else to drink?”In the history of the rule of law, there has never been a professional in it who wanted a tokaji and hadn’t already asked for one. You cannot upsell to these people. You would be brave to even try to take their coat. They would look at me as though I’d tried to sell them some weed in a petrol station. “No” was as polite as it ever got, and often they would just stare, as if I’d made a catastrophic mistake that I would, by the grace of the system, soon pay for.The following summer I worked in an industrial launderette, which was so boring that every Friday everyone took acid and got scared of the pillowcases, and I learned something interesting about comradeship overcoming meaninglessness. I also learned silver service one summer, and still astonish associates with how many plates I can carry at once. On Chancery Lane, I only learned that you expect drunk people to be cheerful, which they are, right up until you imply that they are pissheads who will drink anything then they become exaggeratedly haughty. But this insight has been moderately useful.Music festival bar staff sounded like the ultimate summer job. Rather than work behind a bar for minimum wage to pay for one festival, work the festival itself. Pull pints in full view of the main stage. Spend free time checking out other stages. Pitch up in a cleaner field for staff. Make friends, and leave with some pocket money.I signed up to as many festivals I could a full of summer of love. At the smaller events, that dream was fulfilled. But as the summer progressed and the events grew bigger, the tenor changed. Shifts were long and exhausting, and the weather had turned. Far from a sweet deal where everyone’s a winner, I had been ferried to a distant corner of the UK to work night shifts for minimum wage and shiver in a tent.One particularly awful gig was at a dance music festival where half the punters were high on (presumably) ecstasy and I had to refuse to serve swathes of them unless the order was water. In the mayhem, one punter pointed out that I hadn’t given him a receipt. He said: “It says here that if you forget the receipt, I get these for free.” “Sorry,” I replied, “it’s been a long shift and to be honest that money will come out of my wages.” “Not my problem,” he said. And I thought ecstasy was meant to make you love everyone.Did it help me toward my career? Not at all, although it gave me a profound respect for bar staff and taught me a life lesson: never mix business and pleasure.MP for Birmingham YardleyEvery summer while at school and university, I worked in local pubs. I collected glasses, and worked in kitchens and behind the bar. No other job I ever had better trained me for the world of politics. Working behind a bar teaches you to talk to anyone, especially those you really cannot stand. It taught me to hold my own in a masculine environment and not to take any crap from people who deemed me inferior. In one pub, there was a huge mirror behind the bar, and I would constantly get caught out by it as I turned away from customers who I was placating with fake laughter, only to pull a face or roll my eyes as soon as my back was turned.Working in the pub was where I fell in love with my husband, who was also a seasoned barman. One day, when I give up the world of politics, we dream of buying a little pub and going back to one of the best jobs we ever had.MP for TottenhamMy dad left when I was young, leaving my mother on a very low income to support the family. Understandably, she was constantly fretting about money. So from about the age of 12, I was aware that I had to work every holiday. I did so many different jobs that it’s easy to lose track.One of my longest-lasting jobs was the paper round. I delivered the Haringey Advertiser to what must have been half of Tottenham for several years. My mother and sister would muck in when necessary. I was paid by the batch, so it was vital to deliver every paper. Another summer job was at KFC. As well as showing me how to fry chicken, Bibi Pillay, my brilliant West Indian boss, taught me how to be nice to people, even when I wasn’t in the mood – a great lesson for politics.It was the people I worked with who made my summer jobs worthwhile. Missing a father figure, I sometimes looked to them for guidance. In summer 1988, I worked at the Windsmoor clothing company. My role involved boxing and stacking clothes, which sounds repetitive, but for me it was a fascinating job. This was mostly because of the brilliant conversations I had with my supervisor, Simon, who was three or four years older, and had a cool, cockney, Danny Dyer-type demeanour.Later, in my university holidays, I worked night shifts as a security guard on the construction site of the Goldman Sachs building on Fleet Street. Most of the men I worked with were first-generation immigrants in their late 40s. As a young student, I surely stood out. But they were not afraid to share their rich stories about the bars, bazaars, alleyways and women in Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana, Turkey, Iran and beyond. They taught me so much about the world. My summer jobs made me an adult.I had a deal with my mum that over the school and university holidays, wherever I went, she would pay for my upkeep, but anything else I had to work for. Travel costs and camping gear was my affair. In the 1960s, you could work “on the post” doing delivery rounds over Christmas, but there was more cash moving mailbags. I landed up in the Kentish Town depot with a political activist called Rashmi from what was then Rhodesia, who was planning to topple the white regime an antisemitic old boy who had worked for the Post Office all his life and a Jamaican bloke who said, as we were washing our hands in the Portakabin, a white guy had once asked him how he knew if his hands were dirty or not. I eventually got fired for taking the mick out of the foreman. I’ve still got the hiking rain gear I bought from what I earned, and these fragments of racialised and politicised London from 50 years ago have survived, too.Lord mayor of SheffieldFor about 10 weeks in 2009, I worked 12-hour shifts at the Next distribution centre in Wath-upon-Dearne, just outside Sheffield. I used to get the bus to the station, the train to Swinton, then another bus to the warehouse. It was the year before I went to university and I needed money to do some travelling – I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro and travel around the Middle East and Europe.You used to be able to listen to music while you worked. I was listening to a lot of Black Eyed Peas I would transport myself to a different world in my head and fantasise about my travels, what I wanted to do and how I was going to do it. It used to carry me through. Then they banned headphones – a lot of people were kicking off.It gave me discipline. I always think that if I want something, then I’m willing to really graft for it. It also gave me the skill of dealing with really boring stuff, of just getting on with things. That helps now when I’ve got lots of emails that need responding to – sometimes people ask the same questions again and again, but I know it needs to get done.Doctor, baker and  columnistI did my six years of medical school in London, which basically ended up as six years of financial struggle. My student loan was only enough to cover my rent for the year and, as my parents couldn’t afford to help support me, it meant that all my living money came from my summer and part-time work. During term time, I worked evenings in a clothes shop on Oxford Street. But during the summer, I worked as an office temp for a big mobile phone company.The work was the usual office spreadsheet juggling, but the people I worked with were a lot of fun. The company had a real ethos of treating its staff well and was always putting on after-work drinks. It was also sponsoring a big reality show at the time, so we would get visits to the office from some of the contestants. I had a slightly awkward moment when my dad found pictures I’d had taken with some of them and thought I’d been going to strip clubs.Working in the corporate world of mobile phones hasn’t got much in common with what I do now as an anaesthetist in the NHS. But that summer job still has an impact on how I think about work. It showed me what a large organisation can do when it has the resources striving for efficiency in the NHS is pretty meaningless when you don’t even have functioning IT. It also taught me that poor work conditions and low morale aren’t things that should be allowed to perpetuate they harm the inidual and the organisation.I’m so grateful to have had the job. I met some amazing people and the money was a life-saver. Am I a more rounded person, though, for having worked during my summer holidays? I have no idea. Would I have learned as much if I’d spent my summers vomiting cocktails up on a moonlit Thai beach?Mark, 56, consultant for a global software and analytics company, NorthamptonshireFrom the age of 16 I was an ice-cream man. Compared to what my friends were doing, I counted this as a wonderful job. I benefited from being multi-skilled – which meant being able to produce a respectable cornet from either the harder “pre-frozen” product or from the soft-whip product. I was treated very well by the family firm I worked for. I’m sure this shaped my philosophy when I ended up being responsible for managing people. Having experience of direct interaction and service provision to the Great British Public opened my eyes in many ways – some positive, some less so. Above all, it helped teach me not to make assumptions.Jennifer Macaire, artist and writer, Mantes la Jiolie, FranceSince the age of 12, I had summer jobs. The first one was babysitting the next year, I got a job at the state fairground. My best job was when I decided to sell my own artwork at a beach one summer. I got permission from a local restaurant to sell my drawings and watercolours from their veranda. I was 16 and saving money – I wanted to go to New York City to live after graduation. My part-time and summer jobs helped get me off the island (St Thomas, in the US Virgin Islands) where I was living. But low pay, long hours, no contract and no insurance also taught me about how hard it is to earn money.Suzanne, 26, working in children’s publishing as an editorial assistant, LondonI had a wide variety of holiday jobs from summer camp leader to Christmas elf, but my most memorable one was a holiday I spent working in a factory. All I had to do was pull a lever to put foil on small plastic plaques – over and over and over again. The pay was awful (about £2.50 an hour) – I mostly took the job to prove a point to my parents that I could survive in the world of work – but it made me extremely disciplined. I kept one of the small plaques to remind me of the experience and to encourage me to work hard so that I didn’t end up with a job like that for ever. I now have a great work ethic and appreciate any job that doesn’t involve pulling levers all day!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0afacc21a39f8de35366ca49450100f51c55f91/0_1265_7545_4527/master/7545.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688f6d551f81c9d50523bf63669f8958","title":"ella mai bood up r and b charts number 1","story":"The singer is the first UK star to top the US R\u0026ampB singles charts since 1992, with Boo’d Up – a retro feelgood smash. But, she says, Britain doesn’t quite get itRihanna puckered up to it on Instagram. Nicki Minaj remixed it. Migos crooned along to it. Eighteen months after its release, south London singer Ella Mai’s infectious single, R\u0026ampB throwback Boo’d Up, has gone from being a sleeper hit to the US-conquering song of the summer – last week she became the first British artist to top the US R\u0026ampB charts since Lisa Stansfield in 1992.But when asked to pinpoint a standout moment from her song’s rise to US radio dominance, Mai’s response is decidedly level-headed. “It’s the way it’s steadily progressed,” she says, speaking from LA. She giddily reels off chart positions in the song’s ascent to its current eight-week reign in the US Top 10 as if she is still pinching herself. “For a purely R\u0026ampB song with no featured artists,” she says, “that’s insane.”With its puppy-love lyrics, Boo’d Up is a rose-tinted trip back to a time when a Friday night canoodling at the local arcade was dating goals, and the only right-swiping was at a Tesco checkout. Over a beat that sounds like a lost classic from SWV or Xscape, Mai’s swooning vocals transpose teenage heart-flutters into the chorus’s giddily onomatopoeic hook, on which she scats: “Ba-dum, boo’d up Biddy-da-dum, boo’d up.” Among the sharp-edged trap and hip-hop that dominates today’s playlists, Mai’s laid-back style is a welcome rush of nostalgia, like the first sip of Ribena on a summer’s day.She says it makes her “super proud” to represent the UK, but her US dominance is yet to be replicated in her birthplace. That is partly because Mai lives in LA, where she is signed to hip-hop heavyweight DJ Mustard’s 10 Summers label. But also, “the music industry in England doesn’t really know what to do with R\u0026ampB,” Mai says. “If it were up to England, Boo’d Up definitely wouldn’t be where it is now.”Despite Britain’s rich history of soul artists, pure R\u0026ampB can often feel sidelined. A new wave of artists such as Mabel and Jorja Smith have scored their biggest hits by leaning into Afro bashment and UK garage, while the slightly more retro grooves of Etta Bond, Mahalia, and NAO don’t get the mainstream love they deserve.Growing up in Wimbledon Chase and Mitcham in south-west London, Mai’s mum gave her a love of music, and would play Mary J Blige, Lauryn Hill, and old jazz records around the house. When she got a teaching job in New York City, her daughter, then 12, joined her and moved to the city’s Queens neighbourhood, before returning to the UK at 17 and studying at London’s BIMM music college. At 19, she auditioned for The X Factor with a couple of mates, performing a well-crafted, if unmemorable, cover of a Little Mix ballad. She first truly found her audience on Instagram, belting out soulful takes of Drake and Kanye West hits. “That was a huge part of building my fanbase,” Mai says. “I had no makeup on my hair looked crazy. I was just being myself: the girl next door.”Mai strengthened those connections to fans with sincere songs about self-acceptance, and biting kiss-offs (“I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over,” she sneered on one early track). On Boo’d Up’s parent EP, Ready, tracks are linked by straight-talking interludes aimed at a partner, like Destiny Child’s The Writing’s On the Wall for the WhatsApp generation. But for older audiences, Mai’s retro-leaning style can summon decades-old musical memories. “I can press play on Boo’d Up and reminisce,” says Marsha Ambrosius, a solo R\u0026ampB artist formerly of millennium-era duo Floetry. “I can put my hair in a pineapple up-do, gel down fingerwaves at the side, and feel like it’s 1996. Among all the current madness, you just wanna listen to something that makes you feel good again.”That feeling may be too irresistible for the UK to pass up. On this week’s midweek singles chart, Boo’d Up jumped from 78 to 56, and it was added to Radio 1’s C-list last week, meaning it will be played around eight times a week. “People request it all he time,” says DJ Ace, who runs an R\u0026ampB show on BBC 1Xtra. “I was recently in Ibiza, and that was the number one record that women wanted to hear in the club.”As her next single Trip is released this week, Mai wants Boo’d Up to be a success in the UK: for herself, sure, but also to prove R\u0026ampB’s deserved place at the heart of UK music. “There’s a place for R\u0026ampB in the UK industry, a huge market,” she says. “I hope that Boo’d Up can be a testament to the fact. Sometimes, it takes you moving outside the box to prove that it can be done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e952ddad3c63baa33a6bd1f62f7ff42c31fbe9a/147_80_2085_1250/master/2085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c72284beddf93f9940b46c381ecbc3","title":"is compassion fatigue inevitable in an age of 24 hour news","story":"We have never been more aware of the appalling events that occur around the world every day. But in the face of so much horror, is there a danger that we become numb to the headlines – and does it matter if we do? By  Elisa GabbertIn April this year, a woman calling herself Apathetic Idealist wrote to an advice columnist at the New York Times, asking for help in overcoming a sense of political paralysis. This condition, which was keeping her from engaging in “real action”, began in November 2016, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “I continue to be outraged by this administration’s treatment of Latinos, Native Americans, Muslims, LGBT folks, women and so many others,” she wrote. “But I’m struggling to summon a response.”“I have no doubt that many people can relate to your letter. I can relate to it,” began the response from the columnist, Roxane Gay. “It is damn hard to expand the limits of our empathy when our emotional attention is already stretched too thin.”This seems to be an increasingly common condition. Glance at Twitter or Facebook, and you’ll probably see someone say, “I’m so tired”. There is so much bad news that it feels like we’re running out of emotions. I can relate to Apathetic Idealist, too. For the past several months, I have experienced a creeping psychic exhaustion. “I’m in a numb period,” I tell my friends when they send me frantic texts about the day’s events or ask me how I’m holding up.It wasn’t always like this. In the months after Trump’s election, my husband, John, printed out the phone numbers of our government representatives in Colorado, where we live, and stuck them on the fridge. We started calling them weekly, demanding, even begging them to fight on our behalf – to defend the Americans with Disabilities Act, to fight the attacks on minorities and immigrants and trans people, to fight for gun control. They were supposed to be working for us, weren’t they? My heart would beat faster as I made these calls, trying to translate my anger and fear into something coherent.Sometimes the public outcry seemed to work. A rushed Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act – a flawed but important step toward universal healthcare, established under Barack Obama – failed to find support. It felt like a victory. But a few months later, those same senators cut billions from government healthcare programmes under the guise of “tax reform”. I made a number of calls to my representatives about the tax plan, but it didn’t help this time, the Republicans in Congress had enough votes to pass their plan into law.I haven’t called my senators in months. It was starting to feel like a waste of time and energy. On most occasions, our Republican senator’s office doesn’t even answer the phone. Most of the time, outrage itself feels largely useless. Stay mad, social media activists like to say. How hard is it to stay mad, I remember thinking last year – just watch 20 seconds of any news clip. But it did, in fact, get hard to stay mad. The news is still horrifying, at home and around the world I know this intellectually, but the physical feeling of horror is gone.There’s a clinical name for what Apathetic Idealist and many of us are feeling: it’s called compassion fatigue. Psychologist Charles Figley defines compassion fatigue as “a state of exhaustion and dysfunction, biologically, physiologically and emotionally, as a result of prolonged exposure to compassion stress”. Symptoms include behavioural changes (becoming easily startled, a reduced ability to remain objective), physical changes (exhaustion, anxiety and cardiac symptoms) and emotional changes (numbness, depression, “decreased sense of purpose”). It is an important framework in professions such as nursing, where over-exposure to trauma can lead to health problems for the nurses and worsened outcomes for patients. But it can and has been applied to the general population, too, especially when we are saturated with pleas for attention.Though the term is relatively new, the idea of compassion fatigue has been around for centuries. As historian Samuel Moyn recently put it: “Compassion fatigue is as old as compassion.” And the anxieties that come with our awareness of compassion fatigue go back just as far. According to Moyn, the 18th-century philosophers and moralists who “rooted ethics in sentiment and sympathy” were simultaneously troubled that “devoting oneself to an ethic of exposure and sensitivity to others’ suffering (or of engagement and action to relieve it) might lead to a numbed ethical sense”. It was partly this worry that emotional fatigue could undermine our morals that led Immanuel Kant to abandon sentimentalism for an ethics based in reason – a more objective alternative, at least in theory.The debate around the value of compassion has continued into the 21st century. There are those who argue, following Kant, that a subjective experience of empathy should not be required for moral action, and those who go further, contending that empathy actually gets in the way of morality. But the more commonly held view today seems to be that empathy is vitally necessary, not just for direct human interaction, but as a spur to solve the world’s most pressing problems. Why would we come to the aid of people who are suffering, the thinking goes, if we don’t on some level feel their suffering, too?If it is true that empathy is a necessary motivator for making the world a better place, what happens when we feel bombarded every day with the details of local and global disasters, with every shocking crime, political scandal and climate calamity here and abroad? The war in Syria. Refugee crises. Melting sea ice. Professionals on the frontlines of trauma are trained to watch for signs of “compassion fatigue”, but lately it feels as if everyone is at risk. After a year of news addiction that left me with insomnia and heart palpitations, I’m starting to detach. Is there any way around it? What happens when the world wants more empathy than we can give?The term “compassion fatigue” first appeared in print in a 1992 article by the writer and historian Carla Joinson. While observing nurses in emergency departments, Joinson noticed “a unique form of burnout that affects people in the caregiving profession”. A nurse named Jackie had recently lost her favourite patient, despite “desperate efforts” to save her. Afterwards, Jackie had complained of “lingering feelings of helplessness and anger”. Likewise, a surgical nurse named Marian reported going through a period of “despair and frustration” that almost drove her to leave the profession – until she started to practise a kind of strategic remove.Before it had an official name, something similar to compassion fatigue had been recognised in medical literature. By 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders claimed “knowing of others’ traumas can be traumatising”. Though it was not yet well defined, there was a sense that proximity to trauma could itself be damaging, like secondhand smoke.In the early 90s, Figley explored these ideas further. He identified how professionals providing “empathic support” to people with post-traumatic stress disorder can themselves begin to exhibit some of the same symptoms as their patients, such as anxiety and other emotional changes. According to Figley, trauma spreads to people who work in areas such as healthcare – not only because they are more likely to be exposed to those who are traumatised, but because caring is often inherent to their sense of self: empathy as a liability. Figley, who had served in Vietnam, went on to adopt and popularise Joinson’s term, and became a major advocate for compassion fatigue awareness.If you have ever cared for a sick parent, or child, you might recognise the symptoms of increased stress: the bad sleep, bad moods, bad stomach. I have experienced compassion fatigue as a caregiver myself. My husband has a chronic illness, and when he started getting ill, several years ago, we didn’t know what was wrong. He would be struck with sudden vertigo and trapped on the couch, panicked, for hours. On other days, he was too dizzy to drive, or too unsteady to walk without a cane. Even more worryingly, his hearing started fluctuating, the levels changing from day to day, sometimes better in one ear and worse in the other. This made his work particularly difficult – he was teaching at a university at the time. Throughout it all, he had roaring tinnitus, which he compared to hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, jet engines, sirens, and on one occasion, a UFO landing. Some days he could barely hear anything, and it seemed that any day, he might wake up with no hearing at all, unable to work or communicate, even with me. John was in his 30s.Because he couldn’t reliably drive or talk on the phone, I became John’s assistant, ferrying him to class when he was well enough to teach, cancelling his classes when he couldn’t leave the house, calling doctors and insurance companies, driving to appointments. I still had a full-time job, too. I hated these new and sudden demands on my time and energy, but I hated even more how easily frustrated I would get. If he asked for help when I was busy, I would snap at him, then feel awful about it. Many nights we stayed up late, exhausted we lay in the dark side by side, worrying and arguing.“Stress” doesn’t quite capture this era in our marriage we felt terror and despair. I was afraid for John, yes, but I also felt alone, starved of compassion. I remember thinking (and maybe saying, shamefully) that I wanted someone to take care of me. I was pouring all my emotional resources toward John, and it seemed that he was hoarding his, spending all his feeling on himself. (And wasn’t that natural? Aren’t there times when we deserve to collect, rather than pay out, sympathy?) Studies have shown that stress, anxiety and uncertainty can reduce our levels of empathy. But it felt more like my empathy was being used up faster, due to greater demand.The effects of compassion fatigue on healthcare workers are real and documented. Left untreated, it leads to reduced quality of care, an increase in clinical errors, and high employee turnover. Caregivers take these symptoms home, as well, harming their relationships with friends and family. Accordingly, caregivers are instructed to monitor themselves for signs of compassion fatigue. A textbook authored by Figley includes self-assessments to test your “ego resiliency”, “self-compassion” and “post-traumatic growth” – that is, the “positive changes that some trauma survivors report as a result of the struggle to cope with traumatic events”. In the US, there seems to be a fixation on these positive narratives thus, after a terrorist attack or similar disaster, some will claim it has made them “stronger than ever” – the Hollywood ending for real-world trauma.Caregivers are coached to follow various established guidelines of self-care in order to ward off compassion fatigue, or to recover if it has already struck. These include physical, psychological and social commitments such as maintaining healthy eating and sleeping habits, making time for relaxation and meditation, and building a social support network, including at least two people who can be counted on to be “highly supportive”. If trauma is communicable, one hopes those supporters have a support network of their own.“On any given workday, I’m interacting with many people who are literally having the worst days of their lives,” says an acquaintance of mine who works as a hospice nurse. But she is conscious of the risk of giving any one patient or family too much of her attention and energy. “I don’t try to put myself in my patients’ shoes or try to feel what they’re feeling – although this sometimes happens anyway,” she told me. “I need to maintain my emotional endurance by not using it all up in my first years of being a nurse.”My day job is nowhere near that harrowing I work in marketing. But when I try to keep up the work of an informed citizen, I too feel that my emotional endurance is being tested. There’s a sticky note on the wall by my desk that says: “BE AN ACTIVIST.” It has been there so long that I hardly see it anymore. I worry sometimes that I haven’t paced my outrage.Not long after compassion fatigue emerged as a concept in healthcare, a similar concept began to appear in media studies – the idea that overexposure to horrific images, from news reports in particular, could cause viewers to shut down emotionally, rejecting information instead of responding to it. In her 1999 book Compassion Fatigue: How the Media Sell Disease, Famine, War and Death, the journalist and scholar Susan Moeller explored this idea at length. “It seems as if the media careen from one trauma to another, in a breathless tour of poverty, disease and death,” she wrote. “The troubles blur. Crises become one crisis.” The volume of bad news drives the public to “collapse into a compassion fatigue stupor”.Susan Sontag grappled with similar questions in her short book Regarding the Pain of Others, published in 2003. By “regarding” she meant not just “with regard to”, but looking at: “Flooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react. Compassion, stretched to its limits, is going numb. So runs the familiar diagnosis.” She implies that the idea was already tired: media overload dulls our sensitivity to suffering. Whose fault is that – ours or the media’s? And what are we supposed to do about it?By Moeller’s account, compassion fatigue is a vicious cycle. When war and famine are constant, they become boring – we’ve seen it all before. The only way to break through your audience’s boredom is to make each disaster feel worse than the last. When it comes to world news, the events must be “more dramatic and violent” to compete with more local stories, as a 1995 study of international media coverage by the Pew Research Center in Washington found.Advert-supported media channels survive on attention, and this leads to sensationalism and images meant to shock: starving, bloated children, cities ravaged by war. But these images, by design, are upsetting, and eventually we turn away – a form of self-preservation. And when a story isn’t hot any more – that often meant low newspaper sales in the 90s now it would be judged by a lack of clicks – the media tends to move on. As Tom Kent, a former international editor with the Associated Press, tells Moeller: “We cover things until there’s not much new to say.” In other words, crises often get boring before they get better.In 1991, Moeller says, Americans focused more on cyclones and earthquakes than other, slower global crises, such as famine in Africa, because they saw the natural disasters as “one-shot problems with specific solutions”. There were clear ways to help, finite amounts of aid that would make a substantial difference. Famine, on the other hand, had been going on for years, despite it being a cause célèbre in the 80s, when benefit concerts and charity records had raised tens of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid. For many people, it had probably come to seem like an intractable crisis.The fact that coverage of slowly unfolding, complex disasters tends to be limited is a problem that the public aren’t interested is another. But there may be a good reason for both, beyond moral decrepitude. Numbness or indifference to real atrocity may, from the outside, seem callous. But as Figley has argued, compassion fatigue, in the medical sense, stems from a desire to help. There is no compassion fatigue without compassion: the caregivers at risk see somebody suffering, and they want to reduce that suffering. But they can’t always succeed. Compassion fatigue, then, is stymied compassion.If caregivers are at risk because they give care to the traumatised, then empathetic news consumers are at risk because they consume the news. Just opening Twitter on your phone, or looking at the TV in a bar, exposes you to enormous problems you can’t possibly solve. Perhaps you can help, but the difference that an inidual contribution makes – placing a call, voting, going to a protest – often feels imperceptible.Compassion is generally seen as pure virtue, but is it always selfless? In The Science of Evil, psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen cites multiple studies that reveal an “empathy circuit” in the brain. These are the parts of the brain that usually activate when, for example, we look at a needle piercing someone else’s hand – the psychology-experiment version of watching the scene in Un Chien Andalou, Luis Buñuel’s surrealist film in which a man appears to slice through a woman’s eyeball with a razor. (It’s actually a sheep’s eye.) I cringe and look away because on some automatic level I imagine it happening to me. In some sense, having empathy is a way of feeling compassion for myself.Human propensity to empathy, Baron-Cohen claims, much like height and other traits, follows a normal distribution, the so-called bell curve. This means that a select few people have extraordinarily high levels of empathy – he offers anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu as an example – while some at the other end of the curve have zero empathy, including people with narcissistic personality disorder and psychopaths. (My mother once told me she had read that the two professions that test highest for psychopathy are surgeons and Buddhist monks – presumably because both require detachment. It sounds like dubious science, but does suggest another way in which empathy can be a liability: a barrier to objectivity or enlightenment.) The fact that most people are in the middle of the curve, Baron-Cohen writes, suggests that “moderate empathy levels are most adaptive”. Most adaptive for what, we might ask – proliferation of the species, or good ethics? And are policies that favour local proliferation actively harmful to populations farther away?Average empathy will fail some of the time we will fail to feel what others are feeling, as the hospice nurse I know put it, even if we try. And this may be a rational response, whether conscious or automatic. Empathy, like any bodily process, has a cost. Hunger would be meaningless if it didn’t make you eat. What good is compassion if it doesn’t translate into concrete, external action? Perhaps it is rational to cut off the supply of emotion if it amounts to wasted energy.Can compassion fatigue be avoided, given our unprecedented access to appalling events around the world at every moment? Searching for solutions to apathy in the age of daily mass shootings, I found an article by a family therapist, written in November 2017:The therapist identifies his victim-blaming reaction as a classic case of compassion fatigue, then outlines some solutions to the syndrome. First, the therapist suggests it is necessary to “personalise the tragedy”. “Read the stories of each of the dead and connect with them as people, not nameless victims. This simple act of reading their stories can maintain compassion and protect us from apathy.” (Can it, I wonder? This could be effective for any given mass shooting, but if we read up on the victims of every mass shooting, won’t the hundreds of details begin to blur together?) Secondly: “Be outraged … Don’t give into the desire to withdraw.” (This seems like telling someone the solution to cancer is “don’t have cancer”.) And third: “If you are still feeling burnt out emotionally, look for a tragedy closer to home.”This last tip struck me as particularly inane, as though compassion were an end in itself. Shouldn’t we fight compassion fatigue because we worry that paralysis and apathy will make the world worse? I don’t hope to increase my empathy for its own sake, especially by way of nearby tragedies. In any case, the tragedies are there – my husband’s condition has been diagnosed, but that’s what he would call a pyrrhic victory the condition is deteriorating and has no known cure. I have a friend whose wife is dying of cancer he has had to pay for her treatment through crowdfunding campaigns. This isn’t unusual. Everyone has their own local tragedy.Moeller claims compassion fatigue is not inevitable, and that the media can fight it by providing coverage that is neither formulaic nor sensationalised. “More graphic is not better,” she writes. Sontag, for her part, believed fatigue was a reasonable response to a barrage of terrible images: “Someone who is perennially surprised that depravity exists, who continues to feel disillusioned (even incredulous) when confronted with evidence of what humans are capable of inflicting in the way of gruesome, hands-on cruelties upon other humans, has not reached moral or psychological adulthood.” In this view, compassion fatigue is a coming of age.On the other hand, if we feel entitled to apathy, or even self-righteous about our apathy, it can become an easy excuse for moral laziness. In 2000, the New Yorker published a cartoon that showed two men in suits walking past a disgruntled-looking homeless man asking for money. One suit says to the other: “Here I was, all this time, worrying that maybe I’m a selfish person, and now it turns out I’ve been suffering from compassion fatigue.”I have reached the point where being shocked feels normal it is a fact I hold in my mind but don’t feel in my body. I would like to follow the guidelines of self-care, to preserve my “emotional endurance”, not as a professional caregiver, just as a regular person who cares about the world. So I take breaks and try to reduce my stress. I go out with friends, I watch old poker tournaments on YouTube. But my breaks are getting longer. They feel dangerously close to avoidance.That distance is better, I suppose, than feeling hopelessly enraged. But what is my responsibility? How much am I supposed to know about global suffering, and what can I really do with that knowledge? Social media, 24-hour news, alerts on my phone – the demands on our compassion are much higher than a caveman or Kant had to contend with. It is overwhelming, even paralysing, and very likely makes me less effectual in the local spaces where I might actually be able to do some good. Whether or not I keep up with everything happening everywhere, all the time, I know that the information exists that awareness alone is fatiguing. It’s very easy to succumb to fatalism, which is perhaps the logical extension of compassion fatigue – believing that we’re screwed no matter what we do is mysteriously tempting.Do we need to feel bad in order to do good? The psychologist Paul Bloom, who wrote a book called Against Empathy, argues – or perhaps hopes – that we can be moral without depending on empathy, which is biased and unreliable. We shouldn’t dole out aid in accordance with the amount of sympathy we feel for people we should help the people who need the most help. The answer, in Bloom’s mind, is not to dial up our sympathy for everyone to unsustainable levels, but dial it down so we can approach problems more logically. Even Baron-Cohen, who equates “empathy erosion” with evil, concedes that there are people with zero empathy who are also rigidly moral they do it by systematising right and wrong. This seems to prove that good ethics don’t depend on the feeling of empathy. However, most of us are not that systematic. On New Year’s Day in 2017, John and I invited an activist we know over for dinner, an older man with much more experience in organising than us. While they talked and planned, I cooked and drank wine and grew maudlin. “Stop despairing!” our friend snapped at me. “That’s not a strategy.”The next time I saw him, a couple of months later, he apologised for having raised his voice and conceded that there are many forms of activism. “Maybe writing can be yours,” he said. I had skipped several public protests in the interim, feeling I had too much other work to do. But I was heartened that people I knew attended. I liked the photos they posted on social media – I felt inspired by the size of the crowds, knowing others had the time and energy to march in the streets for what we all believed.It is comforting to think that when we’re too fatigued to fight, someone else will take the lead. It is, perhaps, too comforting.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb11911ffcaa1c2acfe777d781ed0167c3a9099/0_0_3000_1955/master/3000.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026s=e50b30c719c06738e5a885377e8960e4","title":"ukip membership surges 15 per cent in a month","story":"Pro-Brexit party that has taken a far-right turn attracted 3,200 new members in JulyThis sets up a possible battle for supremacy in a party which under the leadership of Gerard Batten has talked more in recent months about Islam than Brexit, and now has close links to Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist released from prison on Wednesday.Batten, who took over in February, refers to Islam as a “death cult” and has called the prophet Muhammad a paedophile. He has also likened Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League, to Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, saying he is “on the right side of a great cause in a struggle between good and evil”.This embrace has prompted disquiet among some senior Ukip members, as has Batten’s decision to welcome a trio of controversial social media activists into the party, including from the far-right website Infowars.One party figure, who asked to not be named, said some MEPs and other senior members had urged Batten to tone down his hard-right rhetoric and focus more on disaffection about the Chequers plan.“It seems ludicrous to be talking about anything other than Brexit at the moment,” the figure said. “We’ve all got our personal policy interests, but this is the only subject in town right now.”Another senior member said Batten’s stance had brought certain MEPs close to quitting. “Some people don’t like at all where Gerard is taking the party, but they’re keeping quiet because of Chequers,” they said. “It also seems likely that some of the new members don’t quite realise what sort of party Ukip is now.”A complicating factor is that not all the new members will be motivated by Brexit. The party has attracted new interest from younger people following the endorsement of the three popular YouTube-based activists. These include Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars, a US website which has argued the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax involving child actors.It means that if others in the party did want a change in direction – even Nigel Farage, who has pledged to return to frontline politics next year if he feels Brexit is being thwarted – they might struggle to wrest back control.“There’s enough people in Ukip now who follow Gerard’s line,” the first senior source said. “It would take a lot of organisation to turn the party round, and it doesn’t currently exist. Instead you’ll probably have two parties in one. Those following Gerard’s views and the people there for Brexit and the Chequers deal.”If Batten remains in charge and Ukip continues to prosper, pressure groups say the party could become the UK’s first modern hard-right political force to join the mainstream, similar to the National Rally, formerly the National Front, in France, or Alternative for Germany (AfD).Some within Ukip have reportedly held talks with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, who has pledged to work with populist and far-right parties across Europe.Batten declined to talk to the , and a party spokesman said the paper was on a list of “biased media” to which it will no longer comment.At a rally in support of Robinson in London earlier this month, however, Batten reiterated his hardline anti-Islam stance. “I want our descendants to be free, not to live under Islamic ideology,” he said.Batten told the crowd: “The founder of their cult was himself a paedophile and kept sex slaves. And yet he is held up to be the perfect model of a man for all time. But we, the infidels and the kafirs, are not supposed to talk about it.”Nick Ryan from Hope Not Hate, which tracks far-right groups, said such views, coupled with existing community tensions and potential disaffection over Brexit, could bring “potent conditions for a radical right movement to try and take advantage of the inevitable anger which will occur”.Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at Kent University, who has studied Ukip closely, takes a different view.

In it, the trust’s senior leadership said it wanted feedback from community first responder volunteers on “very early discussions” for how they could be further used. This included proposals for them driving ambulances.The volunteer community first responders would only be used in “low acuity patient” cases.The trust also told HSJ it would consider using other emergency services and the military this winter to plug staffing gaps. But one senior paramedic at East of England Ambulance Services was “absolutely horrified” by the proposal for volunteer ambulance drivers, even for low acuity patients, adding that it showed how “desperate” the trust was ahead of the winter, suggesting problems around delayed response times, experienced last winter, could be repeated.The senior paramedic, speaking to HSJ on condition of anonymity, added: “Does it pose a risk to patient safety? Without a doubt. What happens if the patient suddenly deteriorates and needs to be blue lighted to hospital?“The paramedic in the back can’t do it. They need to be attending the patient. The staff are very against it. As a paramedic you want to be working with someone who is qualified and knows what they are doing.“I have never heard anything like this in all my years. CFRs fulfil a very important role in their respective communities, but they should be there in their communities, not on frontline ambulances.“I told colleagues at other trusts about the plans and they were absolutely horrified.”Community first responders can be members of the public who have received basic training in life-saving interventions such as defibrillation, off-duty ambulance staff, or professionals from a non-medical discipline who may be nearby or attending emergencies, such as firefighters or security officers. They get five days “intensive” training on how to give basic but often critical support before paramedics can get to a patient.In a statement, the trust said volunteers had been supporting patient care for over 20 years adding: “Many people who volunteer and work in patient transport services bring previous skills and knowledge that can contribute in a different way to the delivery of services during times of extreme service pressure.”It claimed the use of volunteers was widespread in countries such as Canada, the US and Australia adding it was “common place” for volunteers to staff emergency ambulances.The statement said: “While our long-term plan is delivered, it is imperative that the trust consider every alternative to maximise existing and alternative resources to support our patients across the winter period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0c2b157d51e41a531a1159ca7e44ae0678040/0_235_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f50be1bfb0e59d5ec0b5c8adc3d2e9a","title":"adam peaty interview olympic champion european championships glasgow","story":"Olympic champion has rediscovered motivation, application and the fun factor as he aims to get back in the swim at the European Championships in GlasgowWhen Adam Peaty’s winning sequence was terminated on the Gold Coast in April after four extraordinary years it felt like a tidal wave rather than a ripple.He had redefined breaststroke at high velocity. Fifteen titles including Olympic gold and silver, plus a stranglehold on the quickest times in history, attested to his supremacy. Hence defeat at the Commonwealth Games – albeit by four-hundredths of a second over 50m by South Africa’s Cameron van der Burgh – felt\u0026nbspseismic.“A reality check,” he said. The subsequent analysis detected a current of fatigue that had been swirling beneath the surface. “I\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspgoing in the water,” he says, “and it was like: ‘I don’t really want to be here.’ I mean, everyone has down days. It’s just the way we’re wired. But when you’re racing, or you’re training 5,000-6,000 metres a\u0026nbspday, it’s just like: ‘Oh, my God, this\u0026nbspis tough.’”Four months later the 23‑year‑old has undergone what he terms a renewal of his motivation, of his application and, of greatest significance, of the fun factor derived from pushing his muscular frame through the mill at dawn and\u0026nbspdusk. “It stopped me from getting bored really,” he says, grinning. “That I can actually be beaten if I’m not in top form, which is an important lesson in itself. But\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspjust want to be the best, and\u0026nbspgoing through the training these\u0026nbsplast few months has been really positive.”Ominous talk, both for those who would seek to dethrone Peaty\u0026nbspcome the 2020 Olympic Games\u0026nbspin Tokyo and for his challengers at the European Championships which begin on Friday in Glasgow. It is a meeting he can view through the prism of nostalgic fondness. The 2014 championships in Berlin were the venue for his maiden world best amid four golds which was repeated two years later in London. They were staging points en\u0026nbsproute to Rio’s glorious pinnacle.Fame and relative fortune followed. It was principally a blessing but had the potential to affect his willpower. His long-time coach, Mel Marshall, has craftily carved time for commercial activities around diligence in gym and pool – and kept Peaty’s quicksilver feet planted on the ground by embedding him in the Sport in Action project Marshall has long supported in Zambia.The pair have cycled together on a fundraising tour. More recently, Peaty has persuaded sponsors to finance a sports centre in the capital, Lusaka, with pitches for football and courts for basketball that double as havens from the mania outside.“That’s obviously in an enclosed area,” he says. “So it’s not going to be used for gangs, it’s not going to be\u0026nbspused for crime, drugs, alcohol, it’s\u0026nbspnot going to be used for any of that. It’s guarded so people can’t steal the equipment. And the place it was built on was a place where people had been raped, been killed, so it’s a turnaround of the community, the local people out there, and it gives the kids a safe place to go.“We’re lucky enough to be born in the United Kingdom but even more lucky to have these facilities. It just put everything into perspective when you moan about something. It’s like: ‘Shouldn’t be really moaning about that.’”Amid the philanthropy Peaty has\u0026nbsptreated himself to a few rewards for his labours. One of the two Mercedes he acquired to feed his adrenaline has been sold but his favourite, a twin-turbo S63 AMG, remains. “The faster I swim, the more I can get of them,” he says, smiling. Expect the realisation of his grand project, to be the first man to dip under 57 seconds for the 100m breaststroke, to result in another trip to the dealership.But do not expect advancements in Glasgow, he cautions – merely medals. “I’m still at about an eight probably on an emotional level this year, not investing too much.” That is further along the scale than\u0026nbspGold Coast but a long way from the perfect 10 he will demand of himself at the Tokyo Olympics. “The methodology is one: to keep enjoying it. That might sound a bit\u0026nbspcringey but it is all about how much can you enjoy it and get the best out of it.“And two: people only burn out because they forget the reason why they do it. And that’s the most important thing. I don’t really like the term burnout. Because it’s almost, if you’re burning out, then you shouldn’t even be doing it.” Peaty’s fire, reassuringly, is flaming brightly again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6dd021517d429be26b74f3f1ec95083ec685c5/0_66_4972_2982/master/4972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ee75fcf91c46fde28638ac3479d837e","title":"talking horses the racing gods owe me and richard hannon at goodwood","story":"Alhakmah’s defeat was frustrating but a couple of wins at Goodwood on Thursday would make it all right againDid you see Alhakmah yesterday? You know it’s Goodwood when your horse gets knocked sideways, crosses the entire width of the track and then finishes at improbable speed from a mile back to be beaten a neck. I imagine her trainer, Richard Hannon, was throwing things at the screen. That’s what I was doing, anyway.\u0026nbspIf the Racing Gods have any fairness in them, they’ll make it right for me and Richard with a couple of winners in Sussex today. The one I’d really like, please, is Billesdon Brook (3.35), who is surely over-priced at 8-1 for the Nassau.\u0026nbspThis is a race in which winners of the 1,000 Guineas have an excellent record and indeed the Classic winner has followed up in the Nassau for the last three years. Poor old Billesdon Brook, however, comes here as the fifth favourite in a field of six.She was 66-1 when she won her Guineas and punters are slow to forgive horses that sandbag them like that. She’s had one subsequent defeat, at Royal Ascot, and that was evidently enough for most folk to go: “Ha! I knew it was a fluke.”\u0026nbspBut she was given a fair bit to do from the back that day and made up a lot of ground relative to Veracious, who finished one place in front of her after getting the run of the race. This is a much smaller field, with no outstanding talent like Alpha Centauri, and the step up in trip should be good news for Billesdon Brook, whose pedigree is robust for a Guineas winner.\u0026nbspThis return to Goodwood also looks like good news for her, as she won twice there in August last year. Of her opposition, only Urban Fox scares me and it remains to be seen if she can back up her Pretty Polly win, when the runner-up needed further and the third was never really put in the argument.\u0026nbspHannon’s other big chance is with Bathsheba Bay (1.50), who ran well to be third in a hot race at Sandown last month, when a tongue tie was fitted for the first time. He finished a neck behind Alfarris, a winner here on Tuesday, and is only 1lb higher.He also has course form, having chased home subsequent Derby runner-up Dee Ex Bee in a maiden at Goodwood a year ago. Annoyingly, the market has latched on to him since last night and 7-1 is the best available.\u0026nbspPilaster (2.25) is napped at 5-2 for the Lillie Langtry, having shown a touch of class in victory at Kempton last time. She’s a half-sister to Windshear, who is a disappointing hurdler these days but, when he was the same age as Pilaster, was beaten just a neck in a Group Three at the Glorious meeting.\u0026nbspAndrew Balding has had a thin time of it so far this Goodwood but a useful juvenile has landed in his lap in the shape of Shine So Bright (3.00), who was with Karl Burke when he won his debut at Nottingham and then ran well to be fifth in the Coventry just nine days later. He needs to take a decent step forward but there’s every chance he can do that on this first outing for 44 days and there’s nothing terrifying about those ranged against the grey, for all that Marie’s Diamond appears a thorough professional. He’s 9-1.\u0026nbspOver in Ireland, Whiskey Sour (4.35) at 7-1 will do for me in the Galway Hurdle. Willie Mullins’s charge ran a fine race behind some stablemates at Royal Ascot and wasn’t far off the best novice hurdlers last winter. He’s just 2lb higher than when third in the County Hurdle, having come in for solid late support.Tips by Chris Cook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8b93037c19dc2de4d773470b278516eb72112d/206_279_3007_1805/master/3007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f01f9762edb8593d9467e7714fc4f9","title":"england v india first test day two live","story":"67th over: India 227-9 (Kohli 106, Yadav 1) At what point does Kohli start whacking, not just because he can’t trust Umesh but because wouldn’t he fancy a go at England’s openers tonight? What’s amazing about Kohli - ok, there are infinite things that are amazing about Kohli - but it’s the marriage of hard-handed hatin’ and soft-handed lovin’. Sorry, I’ll stop there. Anyway, Stokes raps his pad but outside the line, then some leg-side filth is clouted to fine leg for four. England’s lead is now 55. “I was lucky enough to watch Marshall destroy Australia twice in the 1980s,” emails Jeff Docherty. “Great days. Once in Antigua were he was terrifying, and once in Perth where he was just deadly - I recall the shock of the crowd when Marshall felled Lawson with a vicious bouncer. The match was played in the most hostile atmosphere with WI tormented by the most appalling heckling. They rose above the clamour and were majestic and took Australia to the cleaners.”66th over: India 227-9 (Kohli 106, Yadav 1) Yadav takes a single to cover, then Rashid beats Kohli with one that’s tossed up. Three dots follow, then a bunt down the ground gives Yadav one ball to negotiate, which he does perhaps Theresa May should get him on the team. 65th over: India 225-9 (Kohli 105, Yadav 0) Stokes in to Kohli - I’m sure he feels that a ton has already been earned, and would like him to achieve it for the same of the wonderful game of cricket. He persuades Kohli to hook and he misses, but there’s a sound ... England appeal, the umpire says no, and Kohli grins. Then after a dot, Stokes gives some width, Kohli chases ... AND THERE IT IS! VIRAT KOHLI HAS PERSONALITIED HIS WAY TO A LUDICROUSLY BRILLIANT HUNDRED! He leaps, he punches, he removes his helmet ... what a champion he is. Four to third man, then to underline, italicise and highlight, he smacks four more wide of mid on. We are privileged to be living in his time. 64th over: India 217-9 (Kohli 97, Yadav 0) Ohhhh maaaaate! A replay shows us that Rashid’s wicket ball was going down, and India had a review left! “As an old codger I remember Wes Hall and his partner-in-crime Charlie Griffith well,” says David Keech, “as part of my cricket-watching youth in the 1960s. I lived very close to school and would scurry back at lunch to watch them. They were the most feared fast bowling combination in world cricket back then and Wes Hall should definitely be mentioned in the same breath as Marshall and all the others. The only redeeming feature was that in those days Windies had only two quicks, not four as they dd during their total domination period. If batsman could get through the initial burst, things got easier. Big if though.”But won’t someone please think of the county cricket! Rashid tosses one up ... a googly which befuddles Ishant ... and that is gone. Can’t believe he’s not playing for Yorkshire in the Blast. Disgraceful. Complete spoilt brat. Brexit means Brexit. 64th over: India 217-8 (Kohli 97, Sharma 5) Rashid has the ball as England search for it, and is on the money right away...63rd over: India 216-8 (Kohli 96, Sharma 5) Kohli flashes - now wouldn’t that be a thing - but gets too much on it for slip, and they run two. Then two more come to wide mid on, and he’s easing to a century! For context, Dhawan is India’s next top-scorer with 26, and a turn to leg takes yerman four away. 62nd over: India 211-8 (Kohli 91, Sharma 5) Harbhajan tells us about when Kohli first came into the India team, none of them could pick Ajantha Mendis, so he said not a problem, I’ll go out there and deal with it. He is so good. Anyway, out in the middle, a two to each batsman and an extra single to Kohli make that another decent over for India who now trail by 74 Stokes will now come back into the attack. 61st over: India 206-8 (Kohli 88, Sharma 3) Anderson returns, and after Kohli defends one he exchanges words with Bairstow. Next ball, Kohli looks to attack but Anderson beats him - what a rrrrridiculous athlete he is, this being his 22nd over today. Has he earned himself a square of chocolate? Kohli takes a single from the final ball - surely Root will now make a change? 60th over: India 205-8 (Kohli 87, Sharma 3) I’m surprised that Curran’s been given another over, but his third ball beats Kohli like he’s not there, pitching on leg, straightening and moving away natural variation, says Holding. Kohli leaves Ishant two balls to survive this time, and he does. “Jimmy and the pantheon” begins John Cox with what sounds like a kids’ book title. “This is an instant disqualifier, really, the most-runs-in-an-over record. I’d like to see George Bailey try that against Ambrose or Marshall.”I was on the OBO for that I think, sat in an office on my bill in the middle of night - it felt like watching my dad get beaten up. Bailey was like that kid you got at school or a football party whose team would win not remotely on his account, but who’d give it loads afterwards. REVIEW! Anderson squares Ishant up and raps his pad ... up goes the finger again ... but Ishant reviews again ... and it looked to me like he got outside the line. 59th over: India 204-8 (Kohli 86, Sharma 3) A quiet over, Kohli driving into the covers for a single, giving Ishant one ball to face....58th over: India 203-8 (Kohli 85, Sharma 3) That lead is coming down what a knock this is! Kohli takes Curran’s first two balls for four, a fine twizzle through midwicket followed by as close as he gets to a cut to third man. Three more singles follow, and Root has work to do. “If it’s ‘bowlers most likely to have me touching cloth’, since, say, the mid-80s,”” emails Sean Clayton, “my top 5 in reverse order would be: Wasim, Waqar, ‎Donald, Ambrose, Marshall. I’m lightly sweating just imagining MM bowling short of a length...PS looking at the career s of those five puts into perspective how terrifying it must have been to be a batsman in the early 90s. That makes the Judge’s Test stats even more impressive...”There are a few I’d have ahead of Wasim - Shoaib for sure, maybe Flintoff and Malcolm as well. On which topic, I enjoyed this on Tymal Mills yesterday.57th over: India 192-8 (Kohli 75, Sharma 2) Kohli forces a single to leg, then Ishant scampers - ok, not really - lumbers and lanks one of his own. Direct hit and he’s toast, but it misses and Kohli then forces uppishly, adding two followed by another stretch drive through cover. They might make it into three, but Kohli settles for one. 56th over: India 187-8 (Kohli 71, Sharma 1) Kohli looks to whack one around the corner but only gets one for it. Sharma, though, drives square to get down the other end and then Kohli pulls two. Whatever happens from here, this is a crucial innings in the series - he’s faced down helpful conditions and inspired bowlers to craft and cobble a score. I wonder, incidentally, if we’ll see Stokes very soon - I daresay he’d like a shy at Ishant. Anyway, Kohli gets one from the final ball, so Anderson will be back for hack at him.“We were discussing earlier if Brearley was a reference point any longer,” emails John Starbcuk. “It also looks as if the pantheon of great West Indian speed merchants no longer has room for Wes Hall, who in his day was sometimes quoted as the best in international cricket after the Demon, Spofforth. As well as skill and high pace, Hall also had stamina to spare.”He’s before my time, but yes - and I’ve got time for anyone called called Wesley. Jimmy Anderson has gatecrashed the party! An inswinger keeps low, up goes the finger ... and Ishant reviews...55th over: India 182-8 (Kohli 67, Sharma 0) Anderson will fancy this, five balls at Sharma. And he beats him with the second one as we see Malan again, still looking equal parts rueful and relieved. ENGLAND HAVE TAKEN ONE IN THE SLIPS! I SAID ENGLAND HAVE TAKEN ONE IN THE SLIPS! Shami can’t help but flash at one just outside off, he edges hard, and Malan takes a smart catch that allows him minor shock and tangible, palpable release. 54th over: India 182-7 (Kohli 67, Shami 2) “It’s between the two of them, it’s quite private,” says Bumble of Anderson v Kohli, which is a lovely image and thought he goes on to note that Curran and others are also looking to get the wicket. Maiden. “Jimmy Anderson is astonishing, really,” emails Ben Hendy. I mean, look at this - he has a real chance of taking more test wickets than any other pace bowler in test history. But where does he stand in the pantheon? For me, and this may be mere nostalgia talking, but anyone would be hard-pushed to beat the great West Indians Marshall, Walsh and Ambrose. Where does he fit in after that lot?”I think he might be better than Walsh, and better than anyone in English conditions. The thing is, it’s hard to answer as an amateur because who I think is the best is influenced by who I’m most terrified of facing. 53rd over: India 182-7 (Kohli 67, Shami 2) Kohli defends Anderson for five balls, then dashes for a single to keep the strike. This has been a terrific innings from him, but now what does he do? Farm the strike and stay in, or throw hands? 52nd over: India 181-7 (Kohli 66, Shami 2) Kohli twists to midwicket and calls Shami through for a second run ... a direct hit and he’s gone, and Curran might even snatch and drag ... but he doesnae. So Kohli punishes him, timing four through the same area next ball. Apparently, by the way, people work overseas and holiday abroad. I presume this, like most of what we do, is an attempt to sound hard I insist that holiday must never be used as a verb. 51st over: India 171-7 (Kohli 58, Shami 1) Say what you like about what they doThe maestro strikes and about time! No help needed for that one! And what a beauty it is, slanting in, holding its line, jagging just enough off the pitch and zipping past the outside edge to crack the top of off stump. He is quite good at cricket.VERDICT: NOT OUT. England are all outta reviews. Anderson clips Kohli on the pad with an inswinger, the umpire says no, and it looks to be going down to me, catching the outside of the kneeroll...49th over: India 168-6 (Kohli 57, Ashwin 10) Curran opens with a short, wide piece ay nonsense, so Ashwin uppercuts dismissively over the cordon for four. But Curran comes back and it’s still swinging for him, only Ashwin is solid and blocks him nicely. 48th over: India 164-6 (Kohli 57, Ashwin 6) This is actually a quiet start ... until Kohli reaches again, soft hands guiding a half-batter for four down to third man. Jimmy Anderson has the sphere, Virat Kohli has the strike. Mix me a speedball of that, right now. Right then, here we go: England’s lead is 127, and it’s still cloudy. Teatime email: “‘Abroad’ suggests ‘foreign’, whereas ‘overseas’ suggests it’s really Britain but located somewhere else on the globe, beyond these islands,” teaches Jim Harris. “Although cricket went to plenty of ‘foreign’ parts (as the histories of football clubs like Genoa, Milan and Juventus and South American rugby clubs like Lima, Montevideo and Buenos Aires demonstrate) it is essentially a game that was seeded most effectively in the British Empire. As such, it was never a ‘foreign’ game played ‘abroad’, but a domestic game played ‘overseas’. See also the terminology for the non-contiguous French territories, the ‘Departments d’outre mer’.”Well what a session that was what a match this is. Brilliant bowling, nails batting, drama, skill, misery and intensity everything that everything should be. Like every other earthling with an intellect and a soul, I cannot wait for the final session - see you in 20. 48th over: India 160-6 (Kohli 53, Ashwin 6) Here comes Curran for the the final dash before tea Kohli walks him down to cover the swing ... and is almost nailed Pandya style! But he gets his bat in the road just in time, flicking the ball away and running one, which brings Ashwin on strike. When Kohli took the captaincy he was happy to stick Ashwin at six - he can bat alright - and he waits for a yorker then cuts it behind for four, before shoving two to mid off. 47th over: India 153-6 (Kohli 52, Ashwin 0) If Curran gets another, he’lll be the youngest English bowler to take a fifer since ... ever! Wow. But there’s work to be done here, Kohli driving and Broad ing - to ironical cheers - before he opens the face to guide the four which raises his fifty. No matter: in comes Stokes, and Kohli stretches to flash at a wide one ... AND MALAN DROPS ANOTHER! WHAT A TEST HE’S HAVING! Stokes forces a rueful grin, but in fairness that wasn’t an easy chance, demanding a e. Still, he’s there because he’s good at demanding es. “I may well be talking a bit (or a lot) of bollocks here,” teases Stephen Brown, “but here is my theory on Overseas versus Abroad: Overseas comes before the noun it describes whereas Abroad comes after (or so I was taught in high school back in the dark ages of the late 90s). So, since in sporting terms you probably want to emphasise the foreign nature of whatever you are saying it makes sense for that descriptor to come first. It is an overseas test rather than a test abroad because the test is a secondary factor. More importantly—can we get Rashid on please? 1 over given all of the kerfuffle beforehand seems a rather poor return.”Interesting – I guess “overseas” sounds like more hassle – more testing, if you will – but you do use “overseas” even when talking about another country or other countries, not just to describe a Test. REVIEW! REVIEW REJECTED! Pandya is quick to get in there, but he’s all sorts of plumb. That really was a very fine piece of delivery and he did pretty well just to get so far forward to it. What a delivery is this mutha: fast, straight, inswinging, yorker. Pandya goes forward, gets there first with boot not bad, and the umpire gives him the finger. 45th over: India 146-5 (Kohli 46, Pandya 21) Perhaps Kohli saw Stokes warming up, because here he is. There you go, Hardik old china! Go well! Enjoy! And he does, leaving three of the first five balls - England probably reckon they can bore him out, but not thus far - and then a drive bobbles past Broad, who reluctantly es in instalments, and they run three. More strike for yerman. 44th over: India 143-5 (Kohli 46, Pandya 18) Curran is giving Pandya a tough time here, finding some decent inswing and pushing one just past off stump – though Pandya did leave it. He then edges on, paces a single, andlooks to get himself off strike with a second only to get sent back by Kohli. “Must be all the Ashes voyages, and the stories (in which the sea was always a supporting character),” says Suhas Misra of my imagined abroadoverseas debate. “Plus the stops at the ports -- Bombay, Colombo etc -- that sort of got cricket going hereabouts. ‘Overseas’ invokes all of that more, etymologically, than ‘abroad’, I suppose.”Trudat, and I also wondered if it was Australian influence – I think “overseas” was a word I first heard on Neighbours, along with “spunk”, “affair” and “rack off”.What have you learnt from the tellybox?43rd over: India 142-5 (Kohli 46, Pandya 17) England have just lost a bit of impetus here, and Kohli stretches to square-drive four taking him beyond 39 - his highest score in England. The next hour of this match is going to be crucial, I’d say, and it’s insight like that which explains why they pay me the big bucks. But if England can rustle a lead close to 100, you’d think this match is done if it’s 50 or less, India are right in the mix. And when Broad strays on the pads they’re four closer, Kohli glancing through fine leg, before Broad catches him high on the back leg.

It’s a testament to the progress made in reducing the size and weight of traditional laptops that they are now surprisingly close.There’s still a big market for PCs, so they come in different varieties to meet different needs. The market segments include ultraportables, tablets and convertibles, mainstream laptops, all-in-ones and desktop-replacements, gaming laptops and workstations. Each segment also has different price levels, with “value” ranges for people watching their pennies (eg Dell Inspiron) and high-performance models for upmarket buyers (eg Dell XPS).There’s also a split between consumer and business machines. In general, businesses want their laptops to be functional, durable, expandable and repairable. They also prefer stable configurations. They want to buy thousands of laptops that have the same specifications, not consumer laptops that can change every few months.Both your picks are high-performance laptops built to American Mil-spec standards. The difference is that the T range is designed to be expandable and repairable, like a traditional business laptop, while the X range makes compromises for portability.The ThinkPad T480 is designed to be upgradeable and its two memory slots and can support up to 32GB. This would appeal to programmers and to business users who need lots of memory to handle large spreadsheets, databases and similar tasks.The T480 has a full drive bay that will take a hard drive, though it often ships with an SSD. You can upgrade the HDD or SSD up to a 1TB SSD, if required. It also has a good collection of ports including Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0, HDMI and SD ports, and an RJ-45 Ethernet port.Like some other ThinkPads, the T480 has a second “bridge” battery, which is removable: you can carry a spare and swap over when you run out of juice. The battery life isn’t exceptional with two 24Whr batteries: Lenovo claims 13.9 hours. However, you can install a monster 72Whr bridge battery and run for a claimed 30.3 hours in all. Of course, this adds weight, as well as a bulge at the bottom.Around the start of this century, I used to carry a ThinkPad with two fat batteries and can testify that, if you want really long battery life, it works a treat. But recharging them is a bit of a chore.The T480 is a good choice if you need lots of memory, or have to work away from mains power. But these features may add to the thickness (19.95mm) and the weight (from 1.58kg to 1.87kg).The X1 Carbon is much more like your MacBook Air in being designed to be as thin and light as possible for its screen size and specification. In fact, at its 1.13kg starting weight, an X1 will be lighter than your 1.34kg Air.If you’re carrying it around, you will definitely notice the difference between an X1 and a T480, even if you are young and fit enough not to mind.To save space and weight, you lose the T480’s drive bay and Ethernet port, and the SD card slot is reduced to a microSD slot. But at least you get two Thunderbolt 3 ports, HDMI and an Ethernet dongle.As a MacBook Air user, you will be familiar with the compromises required for an ultraportable laptop. If you found them really frustrating, that would be a reason to go for the T480. If not, the X1 Carbon offers more power and more expandability than the Air, at a higher cost.Both the T480 and X1 Carbon have the latest Intel processors and should deliver much the same performance. Having bought a desktop with a Core i5-8400, I’m pretty confident that the quad-core i5-8250U will last you five years. You don’t need a Core i7-8550U for word processing, note-taking and browsing. The i7 only costs an extra £91.20 in the UK, which is tempting, but perhaps you could spend the cash on a better screen.I couldn’t say which machine has a better keyboard without trying them side by side. In theory, the T480 should be better, because thicker laptops allow keys with more travel. However, given the X1 Carbon’s hero status as Lenovo’s brand leader, I’d expect it to be above average and not significantly worse.Otherwise, as I keep saying, laptop keyboards are not ergonomic. Whenever possible, put your laptop on a riser – or just a pile of books – and plug in an ergonomic USB keyboard and mouse.If you set the brightness too high then it will also devour your battery, but that’s another story.In the end, both machines are good, but they meet different needs. It seems to me that you will benefit from the X1 Carbon’s best features – lightness, fast charging and screen quality – but you will not really benefit from the T480’s features, such as fat batteries and the ability to handle 32GB of RAM. In the end, of course, it’s your money, your choice.Have you got a question?

But are they missing out and what does it do to television?It feels as if we are in a period of boom and bust in TV. It’s definitely boom time in terms of the amount of new shows being produced – more than 520 in 2018 – but the bust comes from how quickly those shows go from critically lauded to seemingly laboured.In the golden age of TV, big shows have tended to have a slow burn. Breaking Bad flew below the radar and survived cancellations and capricious network execs in order to make it to five staggering seasons. The Wire took a similarly glacial path to critical adoration and cult status, as did Mad Men.But now, as TV produces more shows than ever, something has changed. Viewers’ thirst for new shows has grown and – with the rise of on-demand services and competing streaming sites – they have a larger choice than ever before. It is not just the latest crop of productions that is vying for their attention, but also things they might have previously missed in their TV education. It has never been as tempting to quit a show and move on to the next offering.“In general, dramas are the most resistant to steep declines, maybe because the sheer need to know what happens next keeps audiences placated even if the plotting and writing aren’t quite as adept as they once were.”That last idea, that audiences will stick with a show because of its previous achievements, seems to be wearing thin. Announcing that you are quitting a show is in. Producing an extensive list with your reasons for stopping watching it is even better. Some critics have gone as far as to explain how long you should give certain types of shows (comedies, procedurals, dramedies etc) before jacking them in. When the options seem endless in an era of plenty for the viewer, a show’s potency can easily become diluted with each passing season.There could be another factor at work: whether or not a show is deemed “necessary”. In a piece for the New York Times, Lauren Oyler discussed how the idea of necessary art is changing the way people consume culture.“What has become truly necessary is stating the obvious: no work of art, no matter how incisive, beautiful, uncomfortable or representative, needs to exist. Yet the internet — the same force that has increased awareness of social-justice movements — has hyperbolised all entreaties to our fragmented attention s … the concerned citizen’s natural response is to prioritise.”When we prioritise, we shelve those shows we no longer need.Last year shows that arrived with huge fanfare and critical adoration ended with a whimper. Girls, The Americans, Halt and Catch Fire and even – arguably – Twin Peaks, no longer had the critical support or tenacious audiences that their earlier efforts had garnered. Just like Phillip Jeffries, the steam runs out of shows. Others seem simply too big to die.Orange is the New Black seems destined to remain in a sort of TV purgatory. It has more than enough fans to sustain itself on Netflix and the streaming site is keen to back it considering it’s still one of its most-loved originals. But does it feel as vital as it did when it was first released? Remember when Empire was breaking viewing figures and making history? Now it’s a cautionary tale of hubris and the fickle nature of modern viewers.The Handmaid’s Tale looks destined to go a similar route. When it arrived you couldn’t move for critics and commentators falling over themselves to talk about how “timely” it was, but before we were halfway through season two things had shifted. Now its unremittingly bleak brand of TV has become too much for the same people who cheered it on 12 months ago, and the prospect of another eight seasons seems like Gileadean torture rather than something worth enduring.Speaking to The Ringer, Parks and Recreation showrunner Mike Schur made the case for sticking with shows beyond middling first seasons. “You have to bail on things that don’t work, even if you’ve sunk a ton of time into them,” he said, referring to why shows can take time to find their feet. “The reason that most shows’ best seasons are number two and three is because you’ve had enough time to learn about the characters and the audience has had enough time to get to know them.” Who’s up for Handmaid’s season three?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba18963f27f887168b76a5fe486c0e89e27e89d7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44fbc6179b7259b76261ec7bb1d285e","title":"what happens after ice tears your family apart the storm descended","story":"After Ice raids Fresh Mark, a meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, and detains 146 workers, chaos and confusion follow for affected families On 19 June, Ice officers descended on Fresh Mark, a meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, and detained 146 workers. The scene was chaotic. “Nos cayó la tormenta,” one worker told me: The storm descended on us.One minute, people were slapping labels on packages of bacon. The next, there were uniformed men shouting, “Go!” Many workers thought the building was on fire. They fled outside to handcuffs and the swirling lights of police cars. Three men hid in a storeroom, crouched on stacks of wooden pallets. They waited it out and escaped. All the other Hiic workers were detained, even those with work permits.Workers who could prove authorization were let go, though some were held for days. Pregnant women and women with small children were also released, a mercy bestowed only because of timing: earlier in June, after a large raid on an Ohio gardening center, hundreds of children had been stranded at daycare centers and schools when their parents were detained. The situation had caused public outcry, which Ice was keen to avoid this time around.Many of the released women were given ankle bracelets and court dates others were told to watch for papers in the mail. Meanwhile, the women held in detention disappeared. While the detained men were channeled to Youngstown and Cleveland and Michigan and began to strategize with family members via phone, the women vanished more than a week after the raid, no one had any idea where they were.In response, the labeling line at Fresh Mark sped up. The remaining workers had to compensate for missing bodies. Sandra, a Guatemalan mother of three who’d been detained in the raid and released because she was eight months pregnant, explained to me, “Los Americanos se van.” The Americans leave. The work is too much for them, the line too fast, she said, with the only hint of pride I saw light up her face. There were too few workers left: seven out of 11 in Sandra’s unit had been detained. The four who remained were viejitas, Sandra explained: little old ladies.Fresh Mark produces meat products: the hot dogs sold at baseball stadiums across the Midwest, the pepperoni on pizza, the bacon on Wendy’s Baconator. These iconic American products – bought at Walmart and grilled in a backyard on the Fourth of July, sizzled up for Sunday breakfast, chowed in the seventh inning of a Reds game – are carefully prepared by indigenous Guatemalans working long hours without papers.The landing page on the Fresh Mark website is a banner of a little white boy taking a piece of bacon from a paper-towel covered plate, held out by an older white hand. The banner reads: “Feeding families is a great responsibility.” In the lower right corner is a circular stamp declaring “Made With Pride, USA, Since 1920.” The Made in USA stamp travels with the scroll, standing firm in the right corner.Scrolling down, the company announces over a supersized image of pepperoni pizza, “Like you, we take it very seriously. Some of the world’s most well-known grocery stores, food service companies and restaurants count on Fresh Mark.”Scrolling a little further, the message concludes on a photo of a blonde, white girl eating a sandwich: “So our customers and yours,” the banner reads, “can focus on what really matters”.The Friday after the raid, I traveled to Salem with my friend Mary Jayne, who runs a non-profit that offers interpreting and translation services, to volunteer as an interpreter for released detainees and family members of the detained.Approaching Salem from the south-east, we drove on a narrow seam between plots of corn and soybean. Passing through the small communities of Unity and Columbiana, the American flags came on quick and brash: 15, 20, 50 in rapid succession, until the excess was almost comical. Then, quick as they’d appeared, the flags were gone, and we were back in open land and sky.Soon, we arrived at the Centro San Pablo, a charitable organization run out of the packed, overheated basement of Salem’s Saint Paul’s Catholic church.Centro San Pablo is run by Sister Rene Weeks, a tall, thin white woman with close-cropped gray hair who manages to be everywhere and handling everything at once. She welcomed us before disappearing into the fray. Two lawyers sat at a folding table with laptops and papers. The wait to see them was hours long. Women breastfed infants in slings, and many wore outfits that were Walmart incantations of indigenous Guatemalan dress: ankle-length skirts with floral prints, black flats with fake rhinestones. Several girls had combs in their long black hair, which fell to their waists. The men wore baseball caps, sleeveless tank tops and chanclas, open-toed athletic sandals. Most people were considerably shorter than my own 5ft 3in.The room held that distinctly Latin American energy derived from a whole lot of people waiting interminably for an obscure bureaucratic procedure that may never come to pass. There was an open box of sticky Dunkin’ Donuts. Stale coffee. Packages and packages of diapers. We joined the chaos.For the next three hours, we asked people for their names and immigration histories: Were you detained? Was a family member detained? Have you heard from him or her? Did you sign anything? Have you ever been arrested, deported, had any interaction with the law?I snuck in extra questions on the side. I spent years living in Mexico, and my husband is from a tiny village that, 30 years ago, was much like the ones these people had fled. He and I have traveled throughout the remote mountain pueblos of Oaxaca, reporting on immigration, and in these Guatemalan workers’ faces I remembered those mountains – the smoke coming off comales, the señoras hurrying small children wrapped in fleece blankets through vast, empty plazas.“Why did you come?” I asked one woman, whose name I carefully sounded out after she told me with shamed apology that she could not read or write. Her face was marked by the pale splotches that signify malnutrition. Like many of these migrants, her first language was K’iche’, and her Spanish was basic. She squinted to understand me and I leaned closer to understand her. There wasn’t enough food for her and her son in Guatemala, she said. “We were searching for herbs.” When I pressed further, she shook her head, closed her eyes. “No, no, I don’t want to talk about that time.”She had come to the US with her brother, who was now in detention somewhere in the Midwest. She hadn’t heard from him since Tuesday. What could she do? she asked. I had no idea. “Gracias,” she said, and sat back to wait her turn. One intake form after another: detained brother, uncle, husband, wife. Can I go back to work? the room wondered collectively in a dozen variations. Even those with work permits were hesitant one 18-year-old waited hours just to sit with a lawyer and ask him if it was OK to go back.“You have a work permit!” the lawyer told him. “Yes, yes!”Around 5 o’clock, Sister Rene announced that we were done for the day. She asked for a closing prayer from a woman named Flor, who was a full foot shorter than me, with dark hair pulled back in a low ponytail. Flor had been detained in the raid but released. She had five children, including a six-month-old and a one-and-a-half-year-old. She stood in the middle of the room and smiled at us. Then she bowed her head and closed her eyes, thanking the sister and the volunteers, speaking to God with the notes of humility, endurance, and misericordia that form the chorus of the migrant experience. When she opened her eyes, she began to cry.“Pray for my children,” she begged us, sobbing. “¿Qué van a hacer mis niños?”The next morning, Mary Jayne and I returned to the Centro San Pablo with another volunteer interpreter from El Salvador named Ximena. At 9am, families were already waiting to apply for assistance. Their breadwinners snatched, these families were suspended over a financial cliff. My day would be spent cataloguing need. “How much food do you have in your fridge right now?” “How much for rent?” “When is it due?” “Tienes biles?”Most people who weren’t part of a large family lived with at least three or four others. Most did not know their landlord’s name, or the name of their electric, light, or gas companies. Someone showed up on their doorstep once a month and they handed that person an envelope of cash. On time, no questions. I had brought a bag of toys, and the second I put them on the ground they were descended upon by a small girl and boy. I gauged the boy’s age as about two, the girl perhaps four: she was the same height as my daughter. Their mother sat near them on a chair, shushing a tiny baby in a sling. She looked unbelievably young.I beckoned her to come over: “Pase.” She spoke hardly any Spanish, only K’iche’. She smiled a lot. Her baby was barely three weeks old, and sick. Her little girl, whom I had thought was four, was seven. The boy was two. The husband had a job at a rancho, picking fruit or vegetables, but something had happened I couldn’t make out specifics. Neither of them had been working at Fresh Mark but had noticed a fervor of help at this moment and positioned themselves near it.She did not know her address or her phone number and I couldn’t fill out her form. I offered to help carry diapers and wipes to her house so that her husband could give me this information and the Centro could contact them later.We set out across the hot parking lot. The mother walked quickly and the children kept up. The family crossed the streets diagonally, as if they were not streets at all but fields. Each time, I clutched the older daughter’s hand. The houses had chain link fences cordoning off tiny yards, soggy toys toppled in patches of grass. At the house, her husband was surprised and cordial, with a mouth full of gold teeth. He, too, looked impossibly young, barely into his early twenties. He spoke Spanish and explained that he’d been working at a rancho – a farm or gardening center – picking tomatoes, but the work was sporadic, and lately he hadn’t had enough. He was too scared now to try Fresh Mark. He was looking for more work at ranchos, but two huge raids in the preceding weeks made this dicey. He gave me his address and phone number while I watched the seven-year-old carefully remove the two-year-old’s shoes.The kitchen was small and smelled of cooking oil next to it was a living room of the same size, bare except for scattered objects around its edges, with a linoleum floor. I couldn’t see any other rooms, or furniture. The husband thanked me and I waved goodbye, the mother smiling the same smile – innocent or weary, I couldn’t tell.Flor, who’d led the prayer on my first afternoon in Salem, told me: “We ran away from one thing in Guatemala, and now another thing is happening to us.” Everywhere these migrants went, they worked – the most difficult and least appreciated work – and everywhere they went they were loathed for it.When Flor was detained, and she waited for hours panicking about whether she’d ever see her children again, she thought, I am not a criminal. I’m fighting to eat, to give something to my children. I’m not stealing.When the national conversation tends to revolve only around the “illegality” of immigrants – the role of various agencies in immigration enforcement, what that enforcement should look like and how much it should cost, and most of all, whether or not to give “amnesty” – no one actually has to acknowledge their labor.Amnesty is the most ironic term of all: Republicans rage and Democrats cower at the idea of granting “forgiveness” to the people who have, for decades, been powering the US economy. Here the absurdity of their invisible labor reaches its nadir: when we, driving on roads they have built, offering our toddlers the blueberries they have plucked, eating the meat they have slaughtered and cleaned and processed, ask: “Should we or should we not pardon them for their work?”A week later, my husband and I returned to Salem to talk to families affected by the raid and try to get a bigger picture of its effects. The Centro San Pablo was quiet. The detained were still gone – perhaps for years. The released were lying low, trying to decide whether to return to work or pack up and head elsewhere. Several families had already left for Alabama, where there was work in the chicken plants.In the mid-afternoon, a family wandered in. The father, Francisco, was tall and broad-chested. The mother, Sandra, was short with a big gap-toothed smile. (Sandra and Francisco, as well as their children, are identified by pseudonyms.) Sandra was noticeably pregnant and trailing three little girls. They knew most of the small smattering of people in the room and said their holas and como estás before settling in.Sandra was waiting to see what would happen after her release, whether she’d get papers in the mail. Francisco, who had finished his shift at Fresh Mark just before the raid, was trying to decide if and when to go back to work.They had both grown up near the Guatemalan border with Mexico. When she was a baby, Sandra’s parents and grandparents had fled with her to the southern Mexican state of Chiapas to escape the massacre of indigenous peoples by Guatemalan government forces during a devastating civil war. When Sandra was six, her father died, and her mother remarried and started another family. Sandra’s grandparents moved back to Guatemala, taking her with them. She stopped school before second grade, and began work at age seven, harvesting plums, peanuts, hibiscus. “Trabajas por ti mismo,” she told me: You work for yourself.At 14, Sandra’s grandfather died, and her uncle took her in, but not for free. He was a sharecropper in Chiapas. He would take her and other workers in the back of a truck across the Mexican border to his plots of land, where they would shuck and degrain corn all day. She wasn’t paid. She was simply earning her keep. At 18, she decided to join Francisco, whom she’d met in the village, in San Diego.She walked for four days through the desert. Towards the end, her group ran out of water. They used their hands to scrape the needles from cactus leaves and crack them open. The water inside was so sour it was hardly drinkable, but it kept them alive.In San Diego, she and Francisco rented a room for $550. The room was in an apartment with four other rooms, each filled with three men splitting the rent. She bought a small refrigerator and the landlord charged her $25 extra per month for it. She took care of a little boy, and Francisco worked in landscaping, but the money was barely enough. When an uncle told her about rents in Salem – where, for around the same price, Sandra and Francisco could rent a whole house and their family could live alone – they decided to make the move.Francisco had already been in the US for 14 years. He had also started work in Guatemala at seven. In the morning, he would go to school, and in the afternoon his family would assign him a plot of land to work. He was not allowed to rest or do homework until finished, at which point it was dark. “I used to study by candlelight,” he said.He had been deported twice. The first was not long after he arrived he and four friends had the extraordinary bad luck of taking a wrong turn onto a military base. He had no idea at the time that he could avoid deportation because he was a minor. He told the authorities he was Mexican, so they sent him to Tijuana, where he crossed immediately back into the US.The second time, he and Sandra were in Salem and the three girls had been born. He was driving in the snow and the car lost traction and slid up onto a sidewalk, where it was stranded. The police officer who came to help asked him for his license, and that was that. In detention, he said to the Ice officer: “I have my daughters,” and the officer replied: “You’ll have to call them.”Telling me this, he sighed. He crossed his arms over his chest. I asked him if he wanted to stay in the US.“She wants to stay here for the girls’ education,” he said, gesturing at Sandra.“You’d like to go back to the pueblo?” I asked.“Sí, claro, sí, el pueblo,” he replied, like it was a no-brainer. When I asked him what they would do in Guatemala if they went back, he widened his eyes, pursed his lips, and shrugged. It was absurd. It was like asking my daughter what she would do with a million dollars: an unimaginable concept. There was no work. He might, if he were scrappy, be able to run a small subsistence farm that would feed his family. But schools? And where he lived near the Mexican border, he said, narcos were constantly killing each other.We were interrupted by a waitress from Jalisco’s, a nearby Mexican restaurant that had provided free meals for the workers affected by the raid. The waitress, Isabel, was dressed in a teal uniform straight out of a telenovela. She had a pale, heart-shaped face and a sturdy sense of conviction.In Guatemala, Isabel said, the people don’t even have potable water. They live in cardboard houses with tin roofs. There is no money for anything, not even clothes. She pointed to a certificate on the wall, thanking Jalisco’s for contributing funds for a town’s school. The mayor of that town, she told us, had spent money on that certificate for Jalisco’s when the kids at the school didn’t even have notebooks.Francisco nodded. Sandra was on the floor, putting together a butterfly puzzle with Jorge and the girls.“I lived in rough poverty. I know what it is to live through hard times, to get by day to day.” Isabel had come to the US at 25 and started working in a restaurant. There were weeks, she said, when she had nothing to eat weeks she slept as much as possible, so she didn’t feel hungry. Eventually, her sisters had joined her here and they’d opened Jalisco’s. She’d married an American citizen. They had two children.“Here,” she told us, “It’s easy to raise a child who thinks they’re better.” She tried to guard against it, telling her kids, constantly: tú tienes todo. You have everything. Sandra and Francisco gave their three girls American names. The night Sandra was detained, she called Francisco, crying, saying: “Take care of my children.” He was sick with fear. He did not tell the children that their mother might be sent back to a country they did not know. But they picked up on it anyway. On TV, they saw police cars with flashing lights outside their mom’s workplace. The oldest asked why her mother wasn’t home, what was going on. Now, when they see a police car passing, they run inside and hide.Sandra and Francisco work six days a week: he on the am shift, from 6 to 2.30, she on the pm shift, from 3.30 to midnight. He walked to work at 5am so he wouldn’t have to drive. I asked what they did on the weekends and they looked at me for a moment as if trying to grasp the question. The one day they had off – Sunday – they woke, cleaned the house, went to Walmart to buy groceries, then headed to the lavandería to do laundry.That was it. That was their American life.Americans consume their labor, literally – in protein – and figuratively, in the ongoing enthrall to corporate profit. Yet a significant percentage of Americans want to give absolutely nothing in return. Not a fair minimum wage. Not health care. Not decent education in public schools. Not even the most fundamental right of legality.At a candlelight vigil for separated immigrant families in DC, a Sikh priest repeated, “We are not separate. We are not separate. We are not separate.” Greed grows out of separateness, out of a belief that I am more deserving of the luxury of comfort, of security, of my house full of light and books than the African who has crossed an ocean and a continent to get here, than the Honduran man who picked my cherries.Flor told me that while she was waiting in detention, she couldn’t eat, she couldn’t drink. She had no idea if she would see her children again. She had spent $15,000 to get her family here, to this tiny town in Ohio, where there was a job on the line. All she wanted was to work and be with her children.I want to give them the best,” she told me. “You know?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a101504d3fb4a921747266c37bbe1e13d143194/0_311_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4541f8ee9c32641a2cfba348f023442","title":"google working on censored search engine for china","story":"Chinese human rights groups criticise internet company for reportedly designing software that would leave out blacklisted contentGoogle has been condemned for supporting state censorship following reports that the company is working on a mobile search app that would block certain search terms and allow it to reenter the Chinese market.The California-based internet company has engineers designing search software that would leave out content blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to a New York Times report citing two unnamed people familiar with the effort. Such blacklisting would allow the company to reverse its move out of the country eight years ago, taken due to censorship and hacking.News website The Intercept first reported the story, saying the Chinese search app was being tailored for the Google-backed Android operating system for mobile devices.The service was said to have been shown to Chinese officials. Google did not respond to a request for comment. The state-owned China Securities Daily, citing information from “relevant departments”, denied the report.As well as the search app, Google is also reportedly building a second app, focused on news aggregation, for the Chinese market, which would also comply with the country’s censorship laws, according to tech news site the Information. The news app would take its lead from popular algorithmically-curated apps such as Bytedance’s Toutiao – released for the Western market as “TopBuzz” – that eschew human editors in favour of personalised, highly viral content. There was no guarantee the project, code-named “Dragonfly” would result in Google search returning to China. Google already offers a number of apps to Chinese users, including Google Translate and Files Go, and the company has offices in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai. But the largest of its services – search, email, and the Play app store – are all unavailable in the country.Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin has previously cited his birth in the Soviet Union in the 1970s as explaining his opposition to enabling Chinese censorship. “It touches me more than other people having been born in a country that was totalitarian and having seen that for the first few years of my life,” he told the  in 2010, as Google pulled its censorship from Chinese search after four years of co-operating with the authorities.The Chinese human rights community said Google acquiescing to China’s censorship would be a “dark day for internet freedom”. “It is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google’s ‘Do the right thing’ motto, and we are calling on the company to change course,” said Patrick Poon, China Researcher at Amnesty International.“For the world’s biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom. In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory.” GreatFire, a China-based organisation that monitors internet censorship and provides ways around the “Great Firewall” for Chinese residents, said the move “could be the final nail in the Chinese internet freedom coffin.” “The ensuing crackdown on freedom of speech will be felt around the globe,” the organisation added.Speaking to the  in 2016, GreatFire’s co-founder “Charlie Smith” – a pseudonym – had praised Google’s initial decision to pull out of China in 2010, over what it said were cyberattacks aimed at its source code and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.“I think people are going to be very wary and attentive to how Google goes back into China. And hopefully they’re going to show us that there is a way to go back in without having to censor,” Smith said at the time.“I would be disappointed, and I know that a lot of other people would be disappointed, if Google went back in and said ‘we’re going to censor our search results again’, because they’ve made that mistake already, and they should understand that the situation hasn’t changed.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c046668ac20211e567a32e062ba488b1f64c1c8/0_187_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4753b27970191a0d0fa1b87058fb4ecc","title":"stonewall and primark criticised pride t shirts made in turkey lgbt rights","story":"Having merchandise made in country with poor LGBT rights record is unethical, say criticsThe charity Stonewall and the retailer Primark have been criticised for the manufacture of official Brighton Pride merchandise in countries with a poor record on LGBT rights.The clothes are made in Turkey, which has a poor recent record on defending LGBT rights. Critics say it is unethical to ask workers to produce clothing that bear messages illegal for them to voice in their own countries.Steve Taylor, the co-founder of the UK Pride Network and the communications director at EuroPride, said: “The Primark T-shirts are printed in Turkey where Pride is illegal so that is deeply unethical. The issue for me is where the message on the T-shirt is printed, in this case it is in Turkey so that for me is fundamentally unethical.“It is unfair to ask people to do the messages in countries where LGBT rights are a pipe dream and we must not do it.”Isaac Jordan, an amateur photographer, has made a photo series which he hopes to exhibit at Brighton Pride, which starts on Friday, to publicise what he says is an unethical relationship.“A few days ago I decided to go buy a T-shirt to wear during the parade and discovered a dark side to the rainbow flag merchandise sold across high street stores,” he said.“While it is really positive that big brands are getting behind and supporting Pride it should not be at the expense of LGBTQ people abroad who are making clothing for us in the UK but are unable to wear it themselves without fear of violence or persecution.”A Pride event in Istanbul was suppressed this year, following similar actions in previous years. When hundreds of LGBT campaigners tried to march through the city, heavily armed police used teargas and rubber bullets to break the event up after 40 minutes.Officers chased away small groups who assembled on side streets, and Turkey’s official news agency Andolu said about 20 people were detained after protesters failed to heed warnings to disperse. Stonewall defended its partnership with Primark which it said allowed the rights charity to help foster inclusive workplaces in countries where the being a LGBT person could be difficult.Louise Smith, the director of fundraising at Stonewall UK, said: “We work with organisations with offices and operations based around the world to help them support their LGBT staff,. International businesses often operate in countries where the context for LGBT people can be challenging.“In Turkey we are working directly with LGBT rights campaigners to upskill them in practical ways to push forward LGBT equality, including ways to engage positively with local police forces and the broader legal system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae646aabf75edb3d2a152b9a0b4754fcfb08848e/0_185_4383_2630/master/4383.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f677e06bad3a2b3500e195a68efbbee0","title":"europeans keep cool in the heatwave in pictures","story":"As the Met Office forecasts record-breaking temperatures of nearly 50C in Portugal and Spain, people do their best to stay cool across Europe"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584530.1533224846!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"most people underestimate daily water use by half","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon said conserving water was ‘a new conversation’ for many people.More than 50 per cent of people underestimate average daily personal water usage by half, according to a survey commissioned by Irish Water. The average person uses 129 litres of water a day, as verified by Irish Water’s economic regulator, but the utility said 56 per cent of those surveyed believe the average person uses less than 50 litres of water per day.Furthermore, a fifth believe they use between 51 and 100 litres 14 per cent estimate that it’s between 101 and 200 litres and 10 per cent believe it is over 200 litres.The survey was conducted among 1,000 adults by Behaviour \u0026amp Attitudes between July 11th and July 19th. The survey also said two out of three people (65 per cent) have begun to make a concerted effort to change their behaviour to conserve water. The results come as Irish Water launches a public information campaign on the importance of conservation.Irish Water corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon said conserving water was “a new conversation” for many people.“The recent period of drought has shown that the demand on Ireland’s water supply can impact homes and businesses across the country,” she said.“It is great to hear about the practical measures that people are taking like the 43 per cent who are recycling water from the sink or the 60 per cent who are either not washing their car or doing it less frequently.“Our main priority is to safeguard our water for the future and ensure that we do all we can to minimise the risk of widespread outages and interruptions to supply into the future.“We are doing what we can by ramping up leakage repair, taking operational interventions and supporting and educating customers. However, given the size and scale of the challenge that faces us, it is vital that the public continue to play a role in conservation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"michael o leary people want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes","story":"  July 30, 2018Airline chief executive\u0026rsquos move last year cut his remuneration to \u0026euro2.3m   August 1, 2018Unions in four countries plan stoppages for next week as industrial action escalates   August 1, 2018Airline to meet British pilots\u0026rsquo union on Thursday "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584045.1533197620!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no scorching bank holiday weekend ahead met %C3%A9ireann says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe bank holiday weekend is set to be warm in most places but there will be no return to the heatwave that delighted many earlier in the summer.

Saturday and Sunday will be dry in most places with sunny spells in many areas especially in the midlands, east and south. Temperatures will be slightly above average at between 19 and 21 degrees on Saturday and could hit 23 degrees on Sunday. Northwestern and northern areas, however, will be cloudier with spots of mist and drizzle. Monday will again by dry in most areas with sunny spells in the east and south and temperature values will be similar to Sunday. “There is no scorching weekend (ahead). It will be pleasant too for the north and northwest so long as they are not expecting much sunshine,” she said. “There is not a lot of sunshine for the whole of the country. It is rather cloudy.” Ms Donnelly said the forecast for next week was uncertain at this time as the high pressure which will bring the fine bank holiday weekend weather is not a “blocking high”. This means it could be susceptible to Atlantic fronts bringing wind and rain. The temperatures in Ireland are in marked contrast to the heatwave in southern Spain and Portugal where temperatures have been rising above 40 degrees. They could reach up to 47 degrees on Thursday and may even break the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe, which was 48 degrees in Athens in 1977.

Photograph: Kari PerensovichThe granddaughter of a man who discovered a message in a bottle from a Dubliner on the shores of Alaska more than half a century ago has come to Ireland to track down the family of the Inchicore man who wrote the note.It was the winter of 1964 and Michael Perensovich, a wildlife biologist based in the city of Juneau in Alaska, had been sent out on a field exhibition to record the number of moose in the Yakutat region north of the city.Perensovich and his wife had moved from California to Alaska in the late 1950s where the couple bought land near the city of Juneau and built a log cabin. He was often sent on field trips by the forestry department to remote parts of the Alaska and in 1964 he travelled to the Yakutat borough which is known for its long stretches of sandy beach.“That’s where he was the day he found the bottle,” says Kari Perensovich, Michael Perensovich’s granddaughter. “You get a lot of debris washing in on the sand from all over.”Perensovich, on a break from counting moose, was combing the Yakutat beach for Japanese glass fish floats – another item which often washed up on the Alaskan shores – when he noticed a small glass bottle buried in the sand. Inside the bottle was a piece of brown paper with a name and address clearly printed in black marker.“Finder please write John J. Fricker, 215 Sarsfield Road, Inchicore, Dublin 8,” says the message. “Dropped into the Mid-Pacific Ocean April 7th 1963. From MV Irish Rowan.”A year after discovering the bottle, Perensovich wrote a letter to the address in Dublin but never heard back. “He wrote to the address a couple of times but never heard anything,” his granddaughter told The . “He’s always told people about it and if ever you go over to the house he says ‘hey, did I show you my message in the bottle?’ ”Kari, who works as a tour guide in the city of Sitka on Baranof Island where her grandfather has lived since the 1970s, is hoping to find the Fricker family during her summer trip to Ireland. Perensovich has visited Ireland a number of times but only recently remembered the glass bottle that sits in her grandfather’s home. “It’s in a glass case and he hadn’t talked about it in a long time. When I said I was going to try and follow it up he got really excited.”Perensovich, who is originally from a small mining village in western Pennsylvania and flew as a pilot in the second world war, will turn 92 later this month. “My grandma passed away a few years ago but he still has his daily routine and does all his errands. He does all the yard work, he’s very active for his age.”Kari says she is the first member of her family to try and find out who dropped the bottle in the Pacific Ocean. “Everyone’s heard the story a million times so I was like, why hasn’t anybody tried this? I’m the first one to follow it up. It sits on the mantle in his house and he sees it every day. It would mean the world to him if we could find the family.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584254.1533214026!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu ready to improve irish border proposal barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA former Border customs hut in the village of Muff, Co Donegal.  EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is  ‘ready to improve’ the EU’s proposal to the Uk on the Border issue. Photograph: Mary TurnerBloomberg.The European Union has signalled a willingness to be more flexible around the Northern Ireland Border in Brexit negotiations with the UK.There are concerns that sectarian violence could ratchet up in the North if the Belfast Agreement is damaged by the imposition of a hard border when the UK leaves the EU. Efforts to reach an agreement on how to operate a border after Brexit have so far proven fruitless. The EU’s suggested solution - a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU - has so far been rejected by the UK as an attempt at “annexing” the North.In the absence of an agreement between the UK and EU on a withdrawal treaty, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU next March without a transition period – meaning that EU laws and agreements would cease to apply to the UK overnight.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and Northern Ireland in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.In an opinion piece published on the European Commission’s website on Thursday, chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he was “ready to improve” the EU’s proposal on the Border, which he said was “the biggest risk” in the talks process.“Since we will not know what the future relationship will bring by autumn 2018, we need to have a backstop solution in the withdrawal agreement,” he said.“The UK agrees with this, and both the EU and the UK have said that a better solution in the future relationship could replace the backstop.“What the EU has proposed is that Northern Ireland remains in a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU.“We are ready to improve the text of our proposal with the UK.”Earlier this week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stressed that the Government was prepared to be “flexible” on the exact content of the Border “backstop” but was unwilling to compromise on what it must achieve.He said that while the Government was “totally enthusiastic” about solving the problem of the post-Brexit Border when the EU and the UK agree on a future relationship, the Irish Government would not back down on its insistence that the backstop is part of a withdrawal treaty between the UK and EU – due to be agreed by mid-October.“We have to have the backstop as well. We have to have that assurance that unless and until a new solution is in place, that there won’t be a Border.“But yes, we can be flexible certainly on the content of it so long as the outcome is the one that we need,” Mr Varadkar said.Mr Barnier was also positive about reaching a deal “unprecedented in scope and depth” around free trade.He warned that UK proposals must not “undermine” the four pillars of the single market - free movement of goods, capital, services and labour, which he called “one of the EU’s biggest achievements”- by seeking freedom only for goods.“But I remain confident that the negotiations can reach a good outcome,” he said.“It is possible to respect EU principles and create a new and ambitious partnership.” - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Given how strongly this view was held, the injuries that the child sustained were never considered as anything other than childhood accidents. At a press conference in Cardiff , Lance Carver - the director of social services at Vale of Glamorgan Council - apologised for errors in Elsie\u0027s case.Matthew Scully-Hicks has been jailed for lifeThe findings do indicate that social workers and staff from all agencies saw the adoption as very positive, Mr Carver said.They perceived the adoptive family as a really positive solution for Elsie.The report identifies issues that \u0027that positive lens\u0027 meant that they were not looking in the way they should have been.Mr Carver admitted that no disciplinary actions had been taken against any members of staff. Elsie was taken from her birth family despite her grandmother\u0027s pleas to let her care for her and placed with Scully-Hicks and his husband Craig in September 2015, aged 10 months.The men, who already successfully adopted an older child, were seen as a well-educated and articulate couple who were very well regarded by each of the agencies as good parents.The couple, who lived in Llandaff, Cardiff, presented a positive and united front to professionals and never indicated any difficulties with parenting Elsie.The report, by Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan Safeguarding Children Board, states: The evidence in this case highlights that the professionals working with the child did not either consider or raise the possibility that the child was being harmed by a parent.The professionals involved with the child viewed the adoptive placement as being very successful.The events in the child\u0027s life were viewed through a \u0027positive lens\u0027. This is the case for the majority of children placed for adoption.Matthew Scully-Hicks seen by a court artist during his sentencing hearing The report revealed that no safeguarding concerns were raised despite Elsie suffering a number of injuries during her time with Scully-Hicks.In November 2015, Elsie was referred to an orthopaedics outpatient clinic after suffering an injury to her leg and not weight-bearing for five days.An X-ray was taken but this was not examined by a specialist paediatric radiologist. A registrar spotted a lower leg fracture but not an upper leg fracture.Had both fractures been recognised on the x-ray, this would have raised safeguarding concerns that would have instigated the child protection process, the report noted.This review indicated that it would be highly unusual for two separate bones to be broken from one minor fall.In December 2015, Elsie suffered a large bruise to her forehead that lasted for eight weeks.Two social workers and an independent reviewing officer from the Vale of Glamorgan Council saw the bruise during an adoption review at the Scully-Hicks\u0027s home.They failed to make any note of the bruise and it was not brought to the attention of the adoption court, along with concerns that Elsie was developing a squint.Mr Carver said: It is difficult to second-guess what would have happened if that had been recorded properly. It clearly wasn\u0027t recorded properly and that is inadequate.The review noted that all information regarding injuries should be recorded as significant events and that after contact with parents they should be recorded by name as it was not possible to identify which parent was being referred to as in some occasions either parent was referred to as father or dad.Scully-Hicks, of Delabole, Cornwall, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years after being convicted of murder following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court last year.Brave student police officer praised for tackling masked robberIsle of Skye insists it\u0026#39s \u0026#39open for business\u0026#39 amid claims the island has been swamped by visitorsIvanka Trump: Migrant separations a ‘low point’ and journalists are not ‘enemy of the people’Arguments made for and against Brexit during the EU referendum campaignThe battle over 3D-printed \u0026#39ghost guns\u0026#39- and the \u0026#39world\u0026#39s most dangerous man\u0026#39 behind themLottery ticket ripped up before couple pocket £57.9 millionTokyo medical university altered entrance exam scores to curb numbers of female students Imran Khan tells Britain he will retrieve Pakistan\u0026#39s looted wealthRoofer fined £300 for carrying sandwich wrappers and crisp packets in his van Do not touch: Heatwave exposes German Second World War munitions in low waters of ElbeLast month was the second hottest July ever.

The first hike in more than nine years comes after much anticipation from markets, which were pricing in a 90 per cent chance of a rate increase ahead of the announcement, but few specific signals from the Bank. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously, 9-0, to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points, and said future increases are “likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”.The MPC added that it “continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal”.The pound had been trading down 0.4 per cent against the dollar ahead of the announcement, but sharply began to reverse those losses just after midday. Threadneedle Street upgraded its growth predictions for the UK economy to an estimate of 1.8 per cent in 2019, up from the 1.7 per cent predicted in May. The Bank also reported that inflation rose to 2.4 per cent in June, above the 2 per cent target due to “ external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling’s past depreciation and higher energy prices”.Business groups hit out at the decision to hike rates, saying the move risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.What would an interest rate rise mean for household finances?Ten things you should know about interest ratesBank of England deputy governor warns against rate riseWhen the BoE’s rate-setting committee last met, three of nine members voted for a rise to 0.75 per cent.

Interest rates fell from 5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in the period between October 2008 and March 2009 when Britain was in the grips of recession. The base rate remained there until August 2016 when, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Bank cut it again, to 0.25 percent.

In its quarterly earnings outlook, the group said nominal pay growth in the UK is set to hover around or slightly below its current level of 2.7 per cent over the coming months, which is says is “well below its pre-crisis average of 4.5 per cent”.This historically weak pay growth “in part reflects the fact that there is greater slack in the labour market than many economists previously expected”, the Resolution Foundation said. “However, wider evidence indicates that pay pressures have built in recent months as slack has reduced. Nominal pay has bounced back after a slight dip following the referendum, and has been above 2.5 per cent for the past six months.”Meanwhile, pay growth for people who moved jobs in the last year hit 11 per cent in 2018, the highest it has been since 2011, while for those who stayed with their employer, growth was stuck at 2.5 per cent, below the average. However, the foundation said: “Despite the growing pay premium for moving jobs, the proportion of workers who have voluntarily switched employment recently is well down on pre-crisis levels, with just 3 per cent of workers having done so in the last 12 months, compared to an average of 4 per cent in the years before the crisis.”The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis could indicate that its monetary policy committee sees the weak earnings growth recorded recently as being “as good as it gets”, according to the think tank. More than half of UK people feel proud of their jobs, study suggestsPeople are happier at work – but nearly half of us may move onIf MPC members believed that pay growth had cope to improve further, “such a view would underpin the case for holding off on a rise until this stronger pay growth materialises”. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that, despite the growing ‘disloyalty bonus’, young workers in particular seem reluctant to make the move. “While overall pay growth remains weak, interest rate hawks may take the view that, bad as it is, this is still as good as it gets. Those holding off on rate rises may take the view however that recent small upticks in pay pressure mean that things can only get better,” he added.Figures from the Office for National Statistics earlier this month showed UK wage growth had slowed to its weakest pace in half a year in the three months to May. Average total pay was up 2.5 per cent on a year earlier, down from the 2.6 per cent rate in April and the slowest since November 2017.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/14/13/exams.jpg","title":"creative arts gcse subjects ebacc drama music design technology school funding","story":"Created with Sketch.‘Maintaining the skills pipeline is vital to the future of the creative industries’Click to followThe Independent OnlineThe number of teenagers being entered for creative arts subjects at GCSE has dropped significantlyThe number of teenagers being entered for creative arts subjects at GCSE has dropped significantly in the past five years, sparking fresh concerns that the UK’s creative industries could be damaged.Entries for GCSE design and technology in England fell by nearly a third (32 per cent) between 2012 and 2017, a new analysis by the Press Association shows.Performing and expressive arts entries have fallen by 26 per cent over the period, while media, film and TV studies entries have dropped by 22 per cent and drama entries\u0026nbspare down 14 per cent.Entries for GCSE music are down 8\u0026nbspper cent and art and design entries are down 1\u0026nbspper cent.Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM), has warned: “Maintaining the skills pipeline is vital to the future of the creative industries and drop in uptake of arts GCSEs would directly affect this.”Industry experts and headteachers argue that the government’s reforms – which prioritise core academic subjects – are fuelling the decline. And school funding cuts have made the situation worse.The English Baccalaureate (EBacc) – a league table measure introduced in 2011 – only judges schools on the number of students that take up maths, English and science, a foreign language and either history or geography at GCSE.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said schools are trying to keep a broad curriculum “against impossible odds.”On the decline in arts subjects, he said: “This has been caused by a combination of reforms to school performance tables which prioritise traditional academic subjects over the creative arts and a real-terms reduction to school funding which has forced schools to make cuts to the curriculum.”Ministers have said they want to see 90 per cent of students taking the EBacc – which does not include any arts or design and technology subjects – by 2025.Mr Barton added: “The curriculum is in danger of being narrowed to an academic core, depriving students of broader opportunities which inspire many into careers in the creative and design industries and damaging this vital sector of the British economy.”Sam Cairns, co-director at the Cultural Learning Alliance, called it a “social justice issue”. She said: “Research shows that children with an arts deficit are disadvantaged educationally and economically while their more fortunate peers – generally from more affluent backgrounds – are more resilient, healthier, do better in school, are more likely to vote, to go to university, to get a job and to keep it.”Caroline Julian, head of policy and public affairs at the Creative Industries Federation, said: “The exclusion of creative subjects from the EBacc is a key part of the problem, signalling to schools across the country that creativity is not fundamental to future skills and jobs.“This is damaging to our future economy, as the rise of automation will increasingly require the next generation to be equipped with both creative and technical skills.”Ms Annetts, who is also founder of Bacc for the Future, a group of more than 200 organisations calling on the government to review the EBacc, told The Independent: “Our creative industries are worth £92bn a year to the UK economy, and are growing faster than any other part.“With growing automation of other roles and an impending Brexit, maintaining the skills pipeline to these industries will become all the more important.”UK news in picturesDemonstrators against Tommy Robinson outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the  former English Defence League leader has been freed on bail by the Court of Appeal after winning a challenge against a finding of contempt of courtFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

Their risk of developing dementia increased incrementally the more alcohol they were consuming.Rewatching old football matches can help dementia and mental healthExercise could make dementia progression worse not better, warns study“We show that both long term alcohol abstinence and excessive alcohol consumption may increase the risk of dementia,” the authors of the study, published in the British Medical Journal, wrote.\u0026nbsp“Given the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple by 2050 and the absence of a cure, prevention is key.”Among abstainers, the study also found increased risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These are both conditions which could contribute to dementia, a collective term for the loss of memory, thinking and other cognitive functions, and the leading cause of death in the UK.Moderate alcohol consumption has previously been shown to help protect against these conditions, by reducing cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and it may be this which is responsible for the dementia protecting benefit.However the authors said it would be nearly impossible to find a definitive cause without a much larger and impractical trial where participants are randomly allocated to quit drinking or drinking more heavily.The top 10 countries that drink the most alcohol It could also be that people with higher levels of these types of metabolic diseases were more likely to quit drinking, or healthier and more well off people were more likely to be moderate drinkers. The authors said they would not encourage anyone currently abstaining to change their habits.Of the 9,087 participants, who took part in a British study between 1985 and 1993 and were followed for 23 years on average, there were 397 cases of dementia recorded.The study found long-term abstainers were at the most extra risk of dementia (67 per cent), compared to those who were abstinent in midlife (45 per cent) and those cutting down (50 per cent).“The most intriguing finding from this study was the significantly increased risk of dementia among abstainers… and that association was only present in those who abstained from wine,” said Dr Sevil Yasar from John Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, who was not involved in the study.“Wine, in addition to alcohol, contains polyphenolic compounds, which have been associated with neuroprotective effects on both neurodegenerative and vascular pathways, and with cardioprotective effects through inflammation reduction, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and alteration of lipid profile.”However she added that we should remain cautious about the findings.Dr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, agreed, adding: “People who completely abstain from alcohol may have a history of heavy drinking and this can make it difficult to interpret the links between drinking and health.“Future research will need to examine drinking habits across a whole lifetime, and this will help to shed more light on the relationship between alcohol and dementia.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/bank-of-england.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/bank-of-england.jpg","title":"interest rates rise latest updates bank england mortgages mark carney","story":"Created with Sketch.Threadneedle\u0026nbspStreet said further increases will come gradually and to a \u0027limited extent\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineThe Bank of England has raised interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since March 2009, taking the base rate to 0.75 per cent. The first hike in more than nine years comes after much anticipation from markets, which were pricing in a 90 per cent chance of a rate increase ahead of the announcement, but few specific signals from the Bank. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously, 9-0, to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points, and said future increases are “likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”.The MPC added that it “continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal”.The pound had been trading down 0.4 per cent against the dollar ahead of the announcement, but sharply began to reverse those losses just after midday. Threadneedle Street upgraded its growth predictions for the UK economy to an estimate of 1.8 per cent in 2019, up from the 1.7 per cent predicted in May. The Bank also reported that inflation rose to 2.4 per cent in June, above the 2 per cent target due to “ external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling’s past depreciation and higher energy prices”.Business groups hit out at the decision to hike rates, saying the move risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.What would an interest rate rise mean for household finances?Ten things you should know about interest ratesBank of England deputy governor warns against rate riseWhen the BoE’s rate-setting committee last met, three of nine members voted for a rise to 0.75 per cent. Notably, among those voting in favour of a hike was Andy Haldane, the central bank’s chief economist, who went against the majority for the first time ever. Interest rates fell from 5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in the period between October 2008 and March 2009 when Britain was in the grips of recession. The base rate remained there until August 2016 when, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Bank cut it again, to 0.25 percent.

Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else. It’s\u0026nbspterrifying and exhilarating, simultaneously desirable and absolutely the last place you would want to be.Then there’s the drop. The wind hits your face, your stomach feels as if it’s leaping through your body, your cheeks are pushed back into a laugh – or a scream – your whole being is lifted, and despite the rigorous health and safety restraints, for a moment it feels like you’re flying. Then you hit the track again and your whole body is pumping along with your heart and you breathe and laugh – and want to go again. Or not. I can’t understand how some people hate rollercoasters\u0026nbsp– they are one of my favourite things in the entire world.Theme parks around the worldMeet famous characters and get your autograph book signedLego statues of all sizes - from miniland to life size modelsFerrari Land in Port Aventura, Spain, is famous for its fast rollercoastersOakwood is the only theme park in Wales and is home to Megafobia, voted the best ride in the UK and third best ride in the world by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/16/12/tess.jpg  width= 1500  height= 1000  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/16/12/tess.jpg","title":"alien life exoplanet earth first scientists cambridge research","story":"Created with Sketch.‘It brings us just a little bit closer to addressing the question of whether we are alone in the universe’Click to followThe Independent OnlineScientists find planets where life could have started just like it did on EarthScientists have identified a whole set of planets where life could have begun just like it did on Earth.Researchers at Cambridge University\u0026nbspfound that the chances of life developing are tied to the type and strength of light they receive from their star. And they have isolated a range of planets that could have the same conditions, and where life might already have begun in the same way.Published in the journal Science Advances, the study suggests that if a star is giving off enough light, it could kickstart the beginnings of life itself. The UV light appears to power a series of chemical reactions that are central to the beginnings of life.And there are a range of planets that have just that amount of UV light, the researchers say. Many of them not only have the right kind of light but are also of the right temperature to ensure they have liquid water on their surface.Taken together, those planets could offer an important place to search for alien life.“This work allows us to narrow down the best places to search for life,” said Dr Paul Rimmer, a postdoctoral researcher and\u0026nbspthe paper’s lead author. “It brings us just a little bit closer to addressing the question of whether we are alone in the universe.”The work relies on research done by\u0026nbspProfessor John Sutherland, which looked for the chemical origin of life on Earth. It found that it could have been helped by the poison cyanide – once that is formed, it is thought to interact with various parts of the environment including light from the sun, and create the chemicals required to make life begin.That was tested out by putting those chemicals under strong UV lights, where they generated the most basic ingredients of the chemicals needed for life.The new research drew on that work but looked at the exact kinds and strength of light that was required for such interactions.“I came across these earlier experiments, and as an astronomer, my first question is always what kind of light are you using, which as chemists they hadn’t really thought about,” said Dr\u0026nbspRimmer. “I started out measuring the number of photons emitted by their lamps, and then realised that comparing this light to the light of different stars was a straightforward next step.”Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But cooler stars do not seem to work, and so any planets where the interactions happen will need to have the right kind of stars.There are many planets that seem to fit that category, including several exoplanets found by the Kepler space telescope. Scientists expect to find many more candidates in the coming years, with the use of brand new space telescopes like Nasa’s newly launched Tess.It is possible that life might have developed on entirely different planets, in its own way, the researchers noted, but looking for life that began like it did on Earth is the most natural step.“I’m not sure how contingent life is, but given that we only have one example so far, it makes sense to look for places that are most like us,” said Dr\u0026nbspRimmer. “There’s an important distinction between what is necessary and what is sufficient. The building blocks are necessary, but they may not be sufficient: it’s possible you could mix them for billions of years and nothing happens. But you want to at least look at the places where the necessary things exist.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/02/12/harry-kane-fiver-Graham-Short-3.jpg","title":"harry kane five pound note engraved merthyr tydfil graham short golden boot","story":"Created with Sketch.Artist Graham Short\u0026nbsppreviously sparked a nationwide note hunt with his Jane Austen-engraved five pound noteClick to followThe Independent OnlineGraham Short holds one of his micro-engraved five pound notesA £5 note believed to be worth £50,000 after it was engraved with an image of England captain Harry Kane is now in circulation Merthyr Tydfil - Wales.Artist Graham Short, one of the world’s leading micro-engravers, was inspired to make six of the special notes by Kane’s Golden Boot-winning exploits at the World Cup - one for each goal he scored in Russia.Short decided to spend one of the distinctive fivers in the Welsh town where his father was born.

improved position, helped by recent rainfall, we do not want to inconvenience customers unnecessarily at this time.“However, the long-range forecast from the Met Office is one of relatively dry weather into the autumn, so future restrictions are still a possibility if more rain doesn’t arrive.”In the southeast, Thames Water urged customers to save water as temperatures are set to soar beyond 30C again this weekend, pushing up demand.Andrew Tucker, water efficiency manager at Thames Water, said: “There is plenty of water to go around but the sheer volume of water being used all at the same time across our 20,000km of pipes means it’s a challenge for us to produce it quick enough to meet demand.”He said dozens of teams hit the streets in July to find and repair leaks as demand surged in the hot weather, with more than 1,000 being repaired a week, while offering to fix leaks on customer pipes for free.“We don’t want to stop anyone enjoying our water but instead urge everyone to make some really small changes like using paddling pool water to give the plants a drink and using a watering can instead of a hose or sprinkler,” he said.While London is set to sizzle again, the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will enjoy temperatures in the mid-20s, with scatterings of rain.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to

Sketch.Experts have discovered act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and allows its origins to be detected – something previously thought to be impossibleClick to followThe Independent OnlineStonehenge: Origins of those who built world-famous monument revealed by groundbreaking scientific researchA new\u0026nbspscientific\u0026nbspresearch collaboration\u0026nbspis, for the first time, revealing who built Stonehenge. The cutting-edge study sheds a remarkable light on the geographical origins of the Neolithic community that first constructed the ancient site.Complex tests carried out on 25 Neolithic people who were buried at or following the time of the initial construction of the now world-famous monument, have revealed that 10 of them lived nowhere near Stonehenge, but in western Britain, and that half of those 10 potentially came from southwest Wales (where the earliest Stonehenge monoliths came from).The other 15 could be local to Stonehenge, Wiltshire-origin iniduals, or the children of\u0026nbspother descendants of migrants from the west. All the remains were cremations.UCL)Up until now, it has always been assumed that it was not possible to carry out place-of-origin tests on burned bones – but recent research at Oxford University by\u0026nbspBelgian scientist, Dr Christophe Snoeck of the Free University of Brussels, has now discovered that the act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and prevents the crucial origin-indicating isotope evidence from being contaminated by isotopic signals in the surrounding soil.The cremated remains from Stonehenge of the 10 iniduals of probable western British origin, were buried at various stages between the 33rd\u0026nbspcentury BC and the 28th century BC.Half of them (mainly from the 33rd-30th century BC) were probably from west Wales, while others (mainly from the 30th-28th century BC) were probably associated with places between west Wales and Gloucestershire. It’s likely that they were a\u0026nbsproughly even mix of males and females and that they were of high social status. In all the cases, it is not known whether the iniduals died shortly before all or parts of their cremated remains were transported to Stonehenge – or whether they were revered ancestors who had died several generations earlier.Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.The most likely sequence of events suggested by this and other research s literally thousands of years.bluestone quarries, at Carn Goedog, Pembrokeshore, west Wales (Adam Stanford, Aerial-Cam Ltd)Long before Stonehenge itself was built, the area had become ceremonially and ritually important by at least 4000BC.The site had at least one or two large natural sarsen stones which may\u0026nbsphave been used as a focus for pre-Stonehenge ritual activity.Ancient British stone circles were used for ‘Neolithic parties’Stonehenge tunnel \u0027could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age\u0027Ancient Italian Stonehenge accidentally discovered by friendsScientists claim Stonehenge used to be in WalesBy at least 3500BC, elites from western Britain (or at least with western British, potentially south Welsh, connections) began to be associated with the developing sacred landscape of the area.Then in around 3000BC, western British people (from southwest Wales) further developed their links with the Wiltshire area, by transporting dozens of large stones (and the cremated remains of many of their dead) from southwest Wales to a site they had earmarked for the creation of the first version of Stonehenge.Archaeologists now believe that the stones may well have originally been from a stone circle or other monument in southwest Wales which was entirely “uprooted” and transported some 200 miles to Wiltshire and re-erected as a stone circle there.33BC and 28BC\u0026nbsp(Christie Willis, UCL)The recent scientific analysis of the Stonehenge cremated bones (that appear to have been buried adjacent to the newly re-erected stones) is now helping to reveal the origins of the community, which appears to have actually built the earliest version of the\u0026nbspmonument.It is the strontium and carbon isotopic signatures in the cremated bone material that suggest a western British origin for the 10 iniduals\u0026nbsp– and definitely not from the Stonehenge area. The carbon signal, absorbed into the bones from the timber used in the funerary pyre, also suggests a Western or non-local origin.Geologically, previous research has shown that the stones (so-called bluestones or dolerite, used for the early phase of Stonehenge) also came from western Britain (in this case, the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales). Archaeological investigations have now pinpointed the quarries they actually came from – and when they were quarried (some time between the 34th and the 32nd century BC).“The new isotopic evidence shows the scale and frequency of interactions between communities hundreds of miles apart,” said one of the project’s leaders, John Pouncett of Oxford University’s School of Archaeology.“In the past, the research focus at Stonehenge has mainly been on the stones themselves. Now we are beginning to make tremendous progress in understanding the people and the community which built Stonehenge,” said the project’s osteologist, Christina Willis of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology.UCL)The research was carried out by archaeologists and other scientists from the University of Oxford, UCL, the Free University of Brussels, and the Museum of Natural History in Paris and is being published\u0026nbsptoday by the online\u0026nbspjournal\u0026nbspNature Scientific Reports.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.Firstly, it demonstrates the extremely broad geographical horizons that the builders of Stonehenge had. It shows that, despite agriculture increasingly tying people to the land, at least certain sections of society were well travelled and almost certainly had family connections spread across thousands of square miles.Secondly, it shows the lengths that prehistoric people were prepared to go to achieve seemingly non-utilitarian objectives – i.e. the realisation of spiritual or ceremonial aspirations.Thirdly, it suggests the possibility that the western origin of Stonehenge was so\u0026nbspimportant and memorable that it was celebrated across the millennia through collective memory and epic storytelling passed on across the generations. Potential evidence of this is\u0026nbspthe Arthurian story of the magician Merlin, who transports the stones of Stonehenge from the west. The\u0026nbspMerlin story describes how the stones\u0026nbspcame from Ireland – but southwest Wales is certainly close enough to Ireland, and also has\u0026nbspimportant Irish connections. The story was first written during the medieval times – but may well have had its roots in prehistoric collective memory.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/17/chequers-final-say.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1435  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/17/chequers-final-say.jpg","title":"brexit theresa may emmanuel macron france talks eu leave uk trade deal germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Ex-ambassador says ministers must stop\u0026nbspno-deal threats as EU aware of lack of planningClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Theresa May warned Emmanuel Macron unlikely to \u0027soften\u0027 France\u0027s stance ahead of key talksTheresa May should not expect Emmanuel Macron\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsp”soften” his stance towards Brexit\u0026nbspas she gears up for talks at his holiday retreat,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspformer ambassador to France has warned.Lord Peter Ricketts urged\u0026nbspministers against brandishing threats of a no-deal\u0026nbspexit from the bloc, as the EU knows\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspwarnings of walking away\u0026nbspwithout an agreement with Brussels are “a bluff”.His comments came after Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, told French and German leaders to intervene to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU, as he warned the prospect of\u0026nbspno deal\u0026nbspwas “increasing by the day”.Later, an Elysee Palace offical said the meeting between Ms May and Mr Macron is “not a negotiation”, and would not substitute for a discussion with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, and whom has Mr Macron’s “full trust”.The prime minister has cut short her holiday in the Italian Lakes to meet with the French president on Friday\u0026nbspat his retreat,\u0026nbspFort Bregancon, on the French Riviera, while her senior ministers have been attempting to woo European leaders through a series of high-level visits.Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, is\u0026nbspdue to hold talks in Paris today ahead of a meeting with UK and French leaders.Lord Ricketts told the Today programme: “I would have said let’s not go out and brief everyone that Theresa May is going to France to try and get Macron to soften the French position. I don’t see why there is any chance of that.“First of all he doesn’t believe in softening it, he is a passionate pro-European. Secondly he’s the last person to want to break ranks from what has been quite an\u0026nbspimpressively disciplined EU side.”Britain has got to accept it must do the “hard yards of negotiating in Brussels” rather than taking their charm offensive to\u0026nbspEuropean leaders who are not going to “break ranks”, Lord Ricketts said.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party’s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European UnionThe senior diplomat, who acted as ambassador to France from 2012 to 2016,\u0026nbspsaid: “I still don’t understand why the new foreign secretary is going around brandishing this threat of\u0026nbspno deal as if it’s\u0026nbspgoing to make the European countries more\u0026nbsplikely to soften their position on this.”He added: “The problem with no deal\u0026nbspis these crafty foreigners also read our own media and they can see how little preparation has been done. It’s a bluff and I don’t think it’s going to work.”French politician Bruno Bonnell, a member of President Macron’s En Marche party,\u0026nbspsaid Mr Hunt was “playing a dangerous game” with his no-deal\u0026nbspwarnings, which are ramping up the tensions with the French.He said: “This position of threatening for no deal for me is not the best way to seduce or to open the door for the possibilities of deals.”The prime minister and her top team were rebuffed by senior EU figures for trying to go directly to European leaders\u0026nbspto end the deadlock and arrange a more favourable deal for the UK.Speculation over the threat of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit has also ramped up, after Mr\u0026nbspBarnier,\u0026nbsprejected a key part of Ms May’s new Brexit plan, which has also

work cannot provide the trusted, longer-term relationships that are a valued element of youth work, and that are needed by some young people to develop the self-esteem, confidence and skills to take part in such programmes.“Councils have been forced to cut important services for thousands of young residents in recent years as a result of increasingly squeezed budgets, so it is wrong that nearly all of the government’s funding for youth services is being spent on a very short programme which attracts only a small number of participants.UK news in picturesBrexit Minister Dominic Raab is

In its quarterly earnings outlook, the group said nominal pay growth in the UK is set to hover around or slightly below its current level of 2.7 per cent over the coming months, which is says is “well below its pre-crisis average of 4.5 per cent”.This historically weak pay growth “in part reflects the fact that there is greater slack in the labour market than many economists previously expected”, the Resolution Foundation said. “However, wider evidence indicates that pay pressures have built in recent months as slack has reduced. Nominal pay has bounced back after a slight dip following the referendum, and has been above 2.5 per cent for the past six months.”Meanwhile, pay growth for people who moved jobs in the last year hit 11 per cent in 2018, the highest it has been since 2011, while for those who stayed with their employer, growth was stuck at 2.5 per cent, below the average. However, the foundation said: “Despite the growing pay premium for moving jobs, the proportion of workers who have voluntarily switched employment recently is well down on pre-crisis levels, with just 3 per cent of workers having done so in the last 12 months, compared to an average of 4 per cent in the years before the crisis.”The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis could indicate that its monetary policy committee sees the weak earnings growth recorded recently as being “as good as it gets”, according to the think tank. More than half of UK people feel proud of their jobs, study suggestsPeople are happier at work – but nearly half of us may move onIf MPC members believed that pay growth had cope to improve further, “such a view would underpin the case for holding off on a rise until this stronger pay growth materialises”. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that, despite the growing ‘disloyalty bonus’, young workers in particular seem reluctant to make the move. “While overall pay growth remains weak, interest rate hawks may take the view that, bad as it is, this is still as good as it gets. Those holding off on rate rises may take the view however that recent small upticks in pay pressure mean that things can only get better,” he added.Figures from the Office for National Statistics earlier this month showed UK wage growth had slowed to its weakest pace in half a year in the three months to May. Average total pay was up 2.5 per cent on a year earlier, down from the 2.6 per cent rate in April and the slowest since November 2017.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/11/India-assam-0.jpg","title":"india assam register citizens bangladesh voting rolls","story":"Created with Sketch.Government claims that hundreds of thousands of people illegally entered country from neighbouring Bangladesh since 1971Click to followThe Independent OnlineResidents queue to check their names on the final list of the National Register of Citizens India has effectively stripped 4\u0026nbspmillion people from the state of Assam of their citizenship.\u0026nbspThe state has a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which includes the names of all those who can prove they came to the state before 24 March 1971 – the day before Bangladesh declared independence.\u0026nbspIndia has now released a final draft of a list of its citizens, leaving some 4\u0026nbspmillion people to prove their Indian nationality.Force India in administration but to see out rest of the F1 seasonMan accused of cow smuggling beaten to death by mob in IndiaIndia on brink of biggest gay rights victory since independence India tourism ministry launches campaign to highlight safety of women It says hundreds of thousands of people have illegally entered the country from neighbouring Bangladesh over decades and settled down in the northeast – a claim which Bangladesh rejects.\u0026nbspThe application process for inclusion in India’s national register started in 2015.

Nick Robinson makes hilarious point on Bank of England\u0027s Mark Carney                GBP tumbles as markets brace for \u0026lsquodovish hike\u0026rsquo from BoESpeaking at a press conference after the rates announcement, Bank governor Mark Carney said: UK growth in the second quarter is estimated to have rebounded as expected.He confirmed the prospect for further rises as he said if rates stayed at 0.75 percent, inflation would remain above 2 percent throughout the forecast horizon.But he said rate rises are expected to be limited and gradual.He added: Rates can be expected to rise gradually. Policy needs to walk - not run - to stand still.\u0026nbspSpeaking about the upcoming withdrawal from the EU, Mr Carney said the bank is well prepared for whatever path the economy takes, including a wide range of potential Brexit outcomes.He added: The MPC will respond to any persistent change in the outlook to bring inflation sustainably back to 2 percent\u0026nbsptarget while supporting jobs and activity.That is how we set policy two years ago, it is how we are setting it today and it is how we will do so in the future.The minutes released highlighted that Brexit is still one of the most important considerations for the bank\u0027s rate-setting committee.They read: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2 percent inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.In pursuing that objective, the main challenges for the committee had continued to be to assess the economic implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union and to identify the appropriate policy response to that changing outlook.During the negotiation period, those economic implications would be influenced significantly by the expectations of households, firms and financial markets about the United Kingdom\u0027s eventual economic relationships with the European Union and other countries, and the transition to them.The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the second time in a decade (Image: EPA\u0026bullREUTERS)Charles Haresnape, CEO at Gatehouse Bank welcomed the decision as a \u0026ldquolight at the end of the tunnel.He said: \u0026ldquoThe decision to increase the base rate means there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK savers who have faced a lost decade in the low interest rate environment, which has done little to help them build nest eggs for holidays, homes or retirement.\u0026ldquoSavers can now look forward to returns from savings accounts climbing, but this is unlikely to happen overnight.\u0026ldquoWhilst it is likely to be a long time before rates ever return to what anyone over the age of 40 considers \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo, it\u0026rsquos important that people understand the positive impact that getting into the habit of savings can have, helping them to make major purchases or as a safety net for unforeseen financial emergencies.But homeowners are unlikely to rejoice at the news, according to Sam Mitchell, CEO at online estate agents Housesimple.He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough this rate rise is unlikely to cause widespread panic, there will be lots of homeowners feeling a little less financially comfortable today.A generation of homeowners have never experienced a rate rise, and now they have had two in the space of a year.No-one thought that historically low interest rates would carry on forever, but plenty of homeowners would probably admit they haven\u0027t planned ahead for rate rises, unwisely assuming that rates wouldn\u0027t rise for years.But he added a small rise \u0026ldquocould actually be beneficial in the longer term if it will make people pause before committing to a mortgage that might over-stretch their finances.The uptick in interest rates is likely to increase the cost of variable and tracker mortgages, as explained by Jonathan Ivory, MD of build to rent operator at Atlas Residential.He added: \u0026ldquoThis rise will further enhance the attraction of renting, specifically the ever increasing number of communities that are professionally run and institutionally owned.Brexit is still one of the most important considerations for the bank\u0027s rate-setting committee (Image: )Following the announcement, Jonathan Samuels, CEO at Octane Capital said: In raising rates, the Bank of England has arguably put its reputation before the welfare of the average British household.While a quarter per cent increase won\u0027t take home finances to breaking point, it will add to the pressure at a time when confidence is already low.The Bank of England\u0027s hope is that this hike will be a shot across the bows to overly indebted consumers, and there is some logic in that.But the timing of this rate rise, coming in the shadow of outright politico-economic uncertainty, is less logical.Why rock the boat just as we approach the business end of Brexit, all the more so given that inflation is not significantly above target?Thankfully, many households have remortgaged onto fixed rates to protect themselves against rate rises in the medium term.\u0026nbspMark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England (Image: )Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, argued the Bank had \u0026ldquovery little choice but to act today after raising expectations regarding a rise in the last months.But he also said the Bank may have taken an \u0026ldquounnecessary risk, saying: \u0026ldquoRecent inflation data has been softer than expected and UK wage growth continues to remain subdued, suggesting that the UK economy may not be in as rude health as the BoE would like us to believe.\u0026ldquoOn top of this, the UK economy continues to face significant headwinds from ongoing Brexit uncertainty as well as wider geo-political concerns.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommenting on how interest rates have risen to 0.75 percent, Rob Hodgson, Head of Wealth Management at GWM Investment Management, added: \u0026ldquoThe Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, remaining on track to deliver a hike in September.\u0026ldquoCloser to home, financial markets were pricing in the near-certainty of today\u0026rsquos rate rise of 25bp in the U.K.\u0026ldquoThe base rate now stands at 75bp. Banks use the rate as a reference point for the amount they pay savers and charge borrowers, so the move matters to millions of us.\u0026ldquoThat said, after the last rate rise half of savings accounts were unchanged!\u0026ldquoHigher interest rates mean that the BoE believes the UK economy is strong enough to handle a rate rise.\u0026ldquoIt is also trying to control inflation, encourage us to spend a bit less and save more. At 2.4 percent, inflation is above target but that reflects the effects of the depreciation of the pound following the Brexit referendum.\u0026ldquoFurther hikes will be few and far between because UK economic growth is in a fragile state at the moment.The Bank of England kept its forecast for UK growth unchanged at 1.4 percent (Image: )Earlier, Investec economist George Brown said he is fairly confident the Bank will move to raise rates and is pencilling in an 8-1 vote in favour.According to this prediction, the only vote against would come from Sir Jon Cunliffe, the current Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for Financial Stability.Last May, the Bank backed off from a widely anticipated rates hike to wait and see how the economy recovered after slow start of 2018.But Mr Brown believes the economy has performed in line with the Bank\u0027s expectation during the past months.\u0026nbspThe Bank also moved to take this decision in June, when its chief economist Andy Haldane joined two fellow policymakers in calling for a rise.Howard Young at the EY Item Club also believed the MPC will vote in favour of\u0026nbspincrease\u0026nbsprates,\u0026nbspbut said the decision will be debated.He said: We believe that the odds still favour the Bank of England lifting interest rate from 0.50\u0026nbsppercent\u0026nbspto 0.75\u0026nbsppercent\u0026nbspon Thursday after the August MPC meeting - most likely following a split vote.With interest rates down at 0.50\u0026nbsppercent, the Bank of England would clearly likely to gradually normalise monetary policy given that it is essentially an emergency low rate.Furthermore, inflation remains above target and the labour market looks relatively tight with the MPC considering that there is little slack left in the economy.\u0026nbspThe decision to raise interest rates, which represents the cost someone pays for the use of someone else\u0027s money, will be welcomed by savers who have seen very small returns on deposits in the last 10 years.But savers will represent a blow to some borrowers on variable rate mortgages.The Bank\u0027s last move to raise rates in November from 0.25\u0026nbsppercent\u0026nbspto 0.5\u0026nbsppercent\u0026nbspmerely reversed the cut made in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, when the markets plunged.Mr Brown believes the rates raise will be the only increase in 2018.\u0026nbspThe pound made gains versus the euro following the news (Image: )But he predicted Britain will see a quarter point rise every six months after until\u0026nbsp2020,\u0026nbspwhen rates will reach 1.5\u0026nbsppercent.He said: We think the bank wants to raise rates in a gradual way and that would be consistent with the next one in February.According to analysts, the pound will rise at the news and it will increase its exchange rate further if the Bank hints at further interest rates in the coming months.This morning, the GBPUSD was quoted at 1.3114, while the pound-to-euro exchange rate is at 1.1225.Following the announcement, the pound made gains versus the euro and was trading higher by nearly 0.3 percent at 1.128.The interest rate decision improved sterling\u0027s standing versus the US dollar but was still trading lower by around 0.1 percent at 1.311.Viraj Patel, FX Strategist at ING Group said: The Bank of England not hiking this week would be the equivalent of pulling a rug from under GBP\u0026rsquos feet \u0026ndash with GBPUSD falling to 1.280050 and EURGBP rallying to 0.90-0.91.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Richard-Cox-baby-Emily-998029.jpg","title":"Father delivers premature baby home iphone headphones","story":"Richard Cox delivered his baby on the bathroom floor of his home (Image: SWNS)Richard Cox, 31, delivered his baby on January 8th at 1.25am on the bathroom floor of his home in Rosyth, Fife by using his iPhone headphones to cut the babies umbilical cord.His wife, Hayley, 32, went into labour following intense pains in early January, although their baby\u0027s due date was not until the 27th February.Mrs Cox called out for her husband from the bathroom and within a few minutes he had delivered the baby and called 999.Mr Cox said: It all happened so quickly, my wife went into labour late at night and before I had time to dial for an ambulance she\u0027d been born.

Suranne Jones looks unrecognisable in new BBC drama Gentleman Jack                Batwoman: The CW confirms first ever lesbian superhero showAnne, a wealthy Yorkshire landowner was born in 1791 and was the eldest daughter of Jeremy Lister and Rebecca Battle.When her aunt died in 1836, she inherited the family estate, Shibden Hall, which gave her the freedom to live as she pleased.She was known as Gentleman Jack for her love of \u0027male\u0027 pursuits such as shooting, riding and dressing in black.A plaque was put up by York Civic Society last month outside Holy Trinity Church in York where Anne made her vows to her partner Ann Walker.The Society chose to refer to her as a gender non-conforming entrepreneur after consultations with the city\u0027s gay community.Suranne Jones looks unrecognisable in new BBC drama Gentleman Jack (Image: BBC)But the wording is now being seen as a huge insult to the very people that the plaque is supposed to be championing.Petition organiser Julie Furlong said: Anne is an iconic figure to lesbians throughout West Yorkshire particularly.This has quite rightly has offended and angered many people in York and West Yorkshire.A gender nonconforming woman can be many things because it only means that you do not conform to societal expectations. It has nothing to do with sexuality.Anne Lister was, most definitely, gender non-conforming all her life. She was also however, a lesbian.That is why she took vows with her girlfriend in that church, because they were in love with each other and wanted to express that same sex love - the very definition of lesbianism.Calling for more signatures, she added: Don\u0027t let them erase this iconic woman from our history. Anne Lister was a lesbian.The civic society said in a statement: The intention of the plaque is to recognise the impact Anne Lister has had on so many people and to celebrate an important figure and moment in LGBT history.While we\u0027ve received many positive responses to the plaque, we are really sorry that there are also many people who feel let down by the plaque\u0027s wording.The wording was shaped by several open consultations held with York\u0027s LGBT community. It was intended to highlight Anne Lister and Ann Walker\u0027s deep commitment to each other, to reflect Anne\u0027s gender-nonconforming presentation, to raise the profile of queer history and to celebrate an LBGT icon.Portrait of Anne Lister (Image: The Public Catalogue Foundation)The phrase \u0027gender-nonconforming\u0027 was not intended to be read as a replacement for the word \u0027lesbian\u0027.However, we understand and accept that it has been read in this way. We recognise that this has hurt people, and we apologise.We\u0027ve heard the criticism and we\u0027re open to the idea of updating the plaque in the near future. The daughter of a soldier who had fought in the American War of Independence, Lister was attracted to women of similar social standing with whom she enjoyed a number of same-sex affairs.Her first love, as a 13-year-old, was her boarding school roommate and girl of colour Eliza Raine.Over 1 million people will take to the streets to celebrate the annual parade, which is one of the world\u0027s biggest LGBT+ celebrations1 of 20At 21, she dated older heiress Isabella Norcliffe \u0026ndash or Tib \u0026ndash but Lister often complained that her girlfriend\u0027s drinking meant their only bedroom activity involved Tib\u0027s snoring.She fell in love with doctor\u0027s daughter Mariana Belcome, who broke her heart by marrying landowner Charles Lawton.The pair carried on behind Charles\u0027s back for five years, until they became the subject of local gossip.In 1832, Lister fell for Ann Walker, another heiress - and their love forms the story of the BBC drama.Lister and Walker got engaged in 1834 and attended Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York, to take communion as a couple.These popstars are all paving the way for LGBT+ visibility in pop music.                    1 of 18There are more visibly LGBT+ popstars than ever beforeJust six years later, travelling together in the now former Soviet republic of Georgia, Lister suffered a fatal insect bite aged 49.Her body was embalmed and brought back for burial in Halifax.Lister recorded her adventures in 26 volumes of secret diaries so saucy that her fearful family kept them hidden long after her death.The sexual details were encrypted in a mix of Greek and her own codewords - for fear of the law of the time.To refer to orgasms, she wrote the word kiss, while diary entries had Xs in the margin for how many climaxes she had that day.Lister\u0027s term for use of sex toys was saffic regard (sic).Lister\u0027s diaries remained undiscovered for another 50 years, until John Lister, the last family member to live at Shibden Hall, and his friend Arthur Burrell decoded them.

We reveal all...According to the New Scientist, plants need a period of cold then warm weather before they can flower.But because of the long winter, plants that couldnt flower earlier in the spring are more likely to do so all at once.The term is known as a condensed spring because it is far shorter than normal.This causes more pollen to be produced - causing misery for hayfever sufferers.Tree pollen is likely to be worse, which affects one in four Brits.Sadly it does, with the Met Office issuing a warning on June 6 for high levels of pollen across Mid and South England, and all of Wales.This wave of pollen bombs is set to last for three weeks.There is a high tree pollen count, with grass and weed becoming higher later in the year.Sufferers will experience cold-like symptoms - such as itchy eyes and a runny nose - but the threat could be more serious.Half of Brits plagued by hay fever could experience deadly asthma attacks triggered by the pollen.Hay fever and asthma are closely linked, with around 80 per cent of people with asthma finding their symptoms are made worse when pollen counts are high.You can check pollen levels on the Met Office website.Sonia Munde, nurse manager at Asthma UK, said anyone who has both asthma and hay fever should ensure they are taking antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays, and ensure they take their preventer inhaler as prescribed to ward off an attack.She added: Pollen is a top trigger for asthma attacks at this time of the year, affecting an estimated 3.3million people with asthma in the UK.People with asthma who also have a pollen allergy not only experience classic hay fever symptoms such as itchy eyes and a running nose, but are also at an increased risk of a life-threatening asthma attack.Holly Shaw, nurse adviser at Allergy UK, urged people to stock up on antihistamines to help manage their symptoms.Typically the hay fever season starts in mid-March, with tree pollen blooming until May.But this year, the Beast From The East blasted the country with icy weather, delaying spring.And because winter was longer and spring came in late, more pollen is produced.Allergy expert Max Wiseberg warned: “When the tree pollen season is delayed, more trees are likely to release their pollen at the same time, creating a time bomb waiting to explode.“Peaks of tree pollen could be higher than normal.The recent cold wintry weather provided the optimum conditions for this to happen.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

(Answers at the foot of the page).Big Narstie, who began his chat show run by announcing: “First things first, I just want to say ‘Channel 4, you f***ed up’.”And he really wasn’t kidding.WANT to know what it’s like to be a cocker spaniel, locked in a Nissan Micra for two hours on Southend ­seafront? Try watching BBC2’s Stewart Lee: Content Provider, which was recorded live at the town’sPalace Theatre, in April. You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well. Stupid f***ing c***s.”Good luck selling out the O2, Stew.Mystery objects round, as described by Stacey Solomon’s son Zachary: “They’re louder than like a car beeping. They’re very annoying.

All gappy leers, awkward silences and ill-fitting brown suits, this lot were. My word, though, after the briefest of mobile phone interruptions, the sexual chemistry was fair zinging between Annabel Giles and her first date.“Was that your mum?”“No, my mum is dead.”“I’m probably the same age as your mum. How old is she?” She’s still dead, Annabel.If anything though, romantic developments were even less promising back at the girls’ villa on Naxos, where we learnt: “A goat escaped its pen and spent the night in Ingrid Tarrant’s room. There’s poo everywhere.”Whether the poo belonged to the goat or Ingrid, I’m still not 100 per cent sure, but I’m hoping the local match-maker flagged up “a potential bowel issue” with her first date, George, an absolute ringer forHarvey Weinstein, whose background caused a surprising amount of excitement.“He lives in Crete,” Ingrid squealed down the phone to her daughter.“So do they call them Cretins?” Only if he asks for a second date, Ingrid (ITV, Thursday, 9pm).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities?

It’s not right.So I offered to step in and help and I ended up taking over the group.She started to do her research and found that many of us are labouring under a basic misapprehension.Half of these parking fines aren’t worth the paper they are written on, she says.They’re not even fines. Only the police and councils can issue those  – what private parking companies issue are invoices for an alleged debt – and that debt is not proven until they have gone to court.So a lot of it is speculative. They say you’ve done something – I say prove it.And in most cases, she believes, they can’t.Supermarket car parks are a case in point – people often get fined as they have punched the wrong registration in to the machine, or they are in a rush and haven’t bothered to officially record that they are parking, she says.But they are still doing their shopping so there is no financial loss. The parking companies are just trying it on. It’s bullying.Bullying is a word that crops up time and again.I’ve had people get in touch who have complied and put their details in but they have still issued the tickets as they bank on people being too intimidated not to pay, adds Sue.I had one woman who had a letter threatening court when she hadn’t paid a ticket.She panicked and stumped up £160 and they still issued a court claim which is going to court next month. It’s bullying plain and simple.And Sue believes her experience shows that like many bullies they often back down if you stand up to them.It’s very rare they back down at the first appeal, but by the second appeal they usually cave – they don’t want to spend the money and time on the admin.Another bugbear of Sue’s is the plight facing the increasing number of Brits who lease their cars.If you lease your vehicle and get a parking the fine gets sent directly to the leasing company who pays it off immediately, denying the customer the opportunity to appeal, she says.Then on top of that they pass on their administrative costs to you so before you know it you’ve got a £60 or £120 fine with up to £50 slapped on top for the paperwork.In the show, we meet Daniel, known as The Terminator- Weston-Super-Mares most-feared parking warden.His frequently repeated motto is I can tell you where not to park, I cant tell you where to park, - showing the parking crisis is even felt by those who hand out fines.In another parking dispute - a man now nicknamed the Tulk from Luton, saw a neighbour had parked across his aunts drive and refused to move, so he picked up the offending vehicle and rolled it away.Since a clip of his heroic strength emerged online, hes been flooded with requests from angry residents all over the country.Of course, there are times when fines – or invoices – are legitimate.Most of the time though, Sue believes, greedy private companies are exploiting people.The majority of people are not abusing facilities – it’s people who have gone to hospital to see a loved one and don’t read the signs properly in a blind panic.She tells Sun Online about a woman with a terminally-ill husband who took him to the beach to see his last sunset who got a ticket - stories like these that fuel her crusade.Today Sue’s Facebook group has more than 2,000 followers, a number which is growing by the day - yet she admits that her family and friends are baffled by her obsession.My friends think I’m mad, and my mother and sister think I should ditch this and focus on my life with my kids but I just can’t bear to see people suffering, she says.I’ll just carry on what I’m doing and helping as many people as I can who have unfair tickets.Britain’s Parking Hell, is on Channel 5, 8pm tonightOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tourists in Spain and Portugal clearly need to take care in such high temperatures.“Continental heat will move up to Britain from the south. The low 30s are possible from Friday to Sunday.“The South and East will be hottest and it will be a warm weekend for most, although cooler in the North.”The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Record-breaking heat in Spain and Portugal is forecast to approach 50C.“In Britain, Friday could be as hot as last Friday, with 34C not out of the question.“Then, as furnace heat over Spain moves northwards over the weekend, computer models indicate temperatures in southern England rising to 36C.British tourists holidaying across mainland Europe over the next 10 days have been warned to take extra care in the heat, and have been advised to remain out of the sun and to ensure they drink plenty of water.The increased temperatures could cause a surge in heat-related deaths as Brits are warned to stay hydrated with water and diluted fruit juices, and avoid being out in the sun too long.The elderly, infants and those with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are most at risk of death during a heatwave.However, the silver lining for Britain is that the economy is thought to be getting a boost of around £31billion as more people holiday here instead of abroad.Brits are also spending more on sunshine-related treats such as outdoor dining.The recent rain provided a much-needed respite for Britains water supply with United Utilities calling off its hosepipe ban which was due to start on August 5.A spokesman said the rainfall had gone some way to helping with water supplies”.The current record was set on July 10, 1977 in Athens, when the temperature reached 48.0C.Spain’s record is 47.3C, set in 2017 while Portugal’s is 47.4C, set in 2003.Temperatures across Southern France are also set to soar, with highs of around 40C expected within days.At least 27 of Spain’s 50 provinces have been declared an “extreme risk” as temperatures look set to begin soaring rapidly from Thursday.The worst of the heat is set to strike the Iberian Peninsula, close to the border of Portugal, where almost 11,000 firefighters and 56 aircraft are on standby to tackle forest fires."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424197182.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pregnant mum emergency c section anaesthesia california","story":"Delfina Mota was rushed in for the operation when medics at Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, California, were unable to detect her babys heart rate during labour.A lawsuit she filed against the hospital says staff paged the on-call anaesthesiologist several times and waited nine minutes before taking her into theatre.Ms Mota recalled in excruciating detail how she felt a knife cut into her belly and screaming for doctors to stop before she lost consciousness.She told NBC 7 it was something like out of a horror movie.Ms Mota said: Once I felt it, I was just screaming like, stop. I can feel it. And after that Im pretty sure I passed out from the pain.Her fiance, Paul Iheanachor, was outside the room but could hear her screaming before it went quiet.He said: I just tried to wrap my mind around how it would feel to basically be gutted like a fish.If somebody put a knife in your stomach and cut you open, and had their hands on your insides, and ripped your baby out, you know.According to the lawsuit, Mr Iheanachor was trying to get into the room to be with his partner but was restrained by hospital employees.It also alleges that the operation went ahead after the delivery team made several failed attempts to contact anaesthesiologist Dr David Seif.Emergency C-sections are routinely carried out when the doctors believe the mother or baby is in distress and a natural birth would be more risky.The procedure is safe but still a huge op so anaesthesia is required so that the woman is numb and cant feel any pain during the delivery.Ms Mota and her daughter Cali are physically in good health, but the new mum says shes been left traumatised by the birth.She said: Its probably going to stay with me for the rest of my life.A spokesperson from the hospital was not immediately available for comment.A representative of the Anesthesia Service Medical Group (ASMG), of which Dr Seif is a member, denied the allegations specified in the lawsuit.They said: “The group, on behalf of Dr Seif, is confident that anaesthesia services would have been available, and were available.“Additionally, the group and Dr Seif are confident that the care provided by Dr Seif was appropriate under the circumstances.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000252675456.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"glamorising fame fuels selfishness a study shows","story":"Alan Sugar’s The Apprentice, X Factor and Made in Chelsea fuel our get-rich desires, researchers say.They also make people less sympathetic to those who are poor and in need of state benefits.Glossy celebrity magazines, such as Vogue and GQ, can have similar effects.And the change is seen even after the briefest exposure to the world of the rich and famous.The findings come from a survey of 487 Brits, who were asked for their viewing and reading habits and political views.In tests, half a group of volunteers were shown ads for luxury products, pics of celebs, and news about rags-to-riches stories.The rest viewed Tube ads, pics of scenery and dinosaur stories.Afterwards the first group gave more hardline views on poverty and were more in favour of cutting benefits.Study leader Dr Rodolfo Leyva, from the London School of Economics, said:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mum Kelly Griffin said: “This all seems silly. How are you going to know if a three-year-old is being radicalised?”Another mum said: “Let kids be kids”.And a dad with a son aged four at the nursery, said: “There’s too much interference by the Government these days.”Local Tory councillor Dawn Barnett said: “It’s madness gone to the extreme It’s a lovely nursery — this is crazy.”A spokeswoman from the pre-school’s management committee said they were disappointed with Ofsted’s verdict.Little Ducklings, which can take up to 24 kids at a time, was downgraded to “requires improvement” and has until September to update staff training.An Ofsted spokesperson said: “The inspection of Little Ducklings Pre-School found a number of failings.This included variable quality of teaching, a failure to make sure all children made the progress they were capable of, and too few opportunities to develop children’s writing. Children’s early education is crucial for future success, that’s why where pre-schools are failing to teach children well it is Ofsted’s duty to highlight it.The report makes absolutely no mention of radicalisation or jihadis, but instead notes, as one point for improvement among many, that staff did not understand how to protect young children at risk of extreme behaviours or views.This is something that pre-schools are legally required to do and is something which we can all agree is vitally important.”Ofsted also criticised a “variable” quality of teaching and lack of support for kids who speak English as a second language.A 2011 census found the most spoken language in Brighton and Hove after English was Arabic — with 0.8 per cent of residents using it. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know.

Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations.

It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson? Disengage with these foul Islamist countries. Leave them to it. Our people have rights.And they supersede the rights of fundamentalist Muslim fanatics to claim asylum in the civilised, Christian, West.SO, the courts have decided that people who don’t necessarily want the right to die can have the right to die if other people think it’s best for them.What a bizarre judgment.This applies largely to elderly people in a locked-in state, that is a persistent vegetative state.

It provided an estimate of the \"trend real interest rate\", what it calls R*.While this used to be around 5% before the crisis, the Bank said it was currently about half that, at 2-3%, once inflation is included.It indicates that although interest rates are now on the rise, they are highly unlikely to hit pre-crisis levels of above 5% for the foreseeable future.In its Inflation Report, the Bank raised its GDP growth forecast for this year slightly, from 1.4% to 1.5%, and lifted next year\u0027s GDP forecast from 1.7% to 1.8%.  It also predicted that inflation would be 0.1 percentage points higher this year and next at 2.5% and 2.2% respectively.It is that relatively high level of inflation - above the Bank\u0027s 2% target - that helps explain their decision to raise the cost of borrowing. While the economy remains weaker than its long-term average, the Bank pointed out that with productivity also weak and unemployment low, the chances were employers would have to increase wages, which would further push up prices.In a further sign of the strength of the labour market, the Bank cut its unemployment forecast in the coming years, predicting for the first time that the jobless rate would drop beneath 4%, to 3.9%.In the minutes alongside its decision, the Bank said: \"Although the global outlook was a little softer, recent data appeared to confirm that the dip in UK output in the first quarter had been temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter.\"The labour market had continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth had firmed.\"Given these developments, a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting to return inflation sustainable to the target.\"The Committee judged that, were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon.\"All members agreed that any future increases in Bank Rate were likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\"Following the Bank\u0027s decision, The Royal Bank of Scotland and its NatWest and Ulster Bank North subsidiaries also increased their base rates from 0.50% to 0.75%.The group said: \"For those customers on Base Rate Linked products, we will increase their rate to 0.75%."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-cash-money-uk-money_4370246.jpg?20180724143832 ","title":"do you remember where you were in march 2009","story":"But now, at last, the period of crisis-era rates is coming to an end. The Bank has raised borrowing costs to 0.75%. It is not a big increase by any means. And it still leaves Bank rate well below \"normal\" levels (which these days are closer to 2.5% than 5%, according to the Bank).All the same, as the Bank took its decision today, the mood could hardly have been more different from those crisis days.There was a slightly surreal absence of drama in the air.Why? Mainly because this decision - highly symbolic as it might be - was actually unusually uncontroversial. Every one of the nine MPC members voted for it - the first time there has been unanimity for a rate increase in more than a decade.The move was widely anticipated in financial markets. And the Bank said that while it would take a tiny bit off economic growth, it was unlikely to leave a major dent in the economy. Many people within the economy fraternity have spent the past decade or so fretting about what higher interest rates would do to households. Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it?In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal.The message seems to have been received.On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs.For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-macron_4331049.jpg?20180608162011 ","title":"emmanuel macron wont allow theresa may to bypass brussels over brexit","story":"The French president was described as having full trust in Mr Barnier and in the EU chief Brexit negotiator\u0027s response to Mrs May\u0027s Brexit proposals, an Elysee Palace official said.The prime minister has cut short her current holiday in Italy in order to meet Mr Macron, with the French president said to have invited Mrs May for talks following a request for a meeting by Downing Street.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have both met their respective French counterparts already this week, with UK ministers launching a charm offensive on EU capitals this summer in order to sell Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan.Earlier on Thursday, Mr Barnier repeated his opposition to the prime minister\u0027s proposals, as thrashed out by ministers at a Chequers meeting last month and subsequently published in a government white paper.

It was a crisis, and what do we do in times of crisis? We come together. That is what we should have done. There should have been a cross-party and inclusive group to conduct the negotiations and we should have worked on a proposal that would, at the minimum, have appealed to a majority of those who voted in the referendum.  The last general election even returned a hung Parliament – a sign that the people did not think one party could do this on its own. Instead, what Theresa May has done is to limit the debate to the agenda of warring factions inside her own party. Everyone else – all of us – has been shut out. In the last two years we have seen no progress and, in that time, a whole new generation of voters, who were not allowed to vote two years ago, have now become eligible but have been forced to watch while their future is debated in front of them and they have no say whatsoever.

Dame Martina Milburn, who was appointed to a post left empty for six months, also rejected the idea that the gender pay gap was stifling social mobility and should fall within her remit. The former journalist who went on to hold senior charity roles replaced former Labour minister Alan Milburn who quit the post along with the rest of his team, in frustration at what they saw as the Tories’ lack of commitment to the issue. But Dame Martina denied the impact of devastating cuts on life chances. “I don’t think the stats show that it has, actually, oddly, because you would think that it would, but as I understand it social mobility has been quite flat for a long time,” she said in an interview with HuffPost UK. Her comments will alarm many of those who have been dismayed by the government’s seeming lack of interest in social mobility - despite commitments made by Theresa May.  And they would seem to contradict evidence from respected thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) which published evidence last November showing that child poverty is set to rise significantly between 2015-16 and 2021-22 as a direct result of benefit cuts. It found that absolute child poverty would increase by around 4 percentage points on the government’s official measure during that period with around three-quarters - equal to 400,000 children, attributable to benefit changes. The freeze to most working-age benefits means that around 7.5 million low income households will see their benefit entitlements cut by over \u0026pound500 per year in real terms. The limiting of tax credits and universal credit to two children means that some low income families will receive over \u0026pound2,500 less in benefits than they otherwise would have.  Research from the Resolution Foundation released this week found that child poverty is projected to have increased last year by around 3 per cent - more than previously thought. It blamed this on benefit cuts that particularly hit low-income families, including the 3 per cent real-terms fall in the value of tax credits and child benefit. However it also found that in contrast to rises in poverty, inequality has remained broadly flat since 2010-11. The IFS also found earlier this month that per-pupil spending on schools had fallen by 8% since 2010. Since education is widely seen as key in improving life chances this would also challenge Dame Martina’s separation of government cuts from the drop in social mobility outlined by the outgoing commission in a damning report last year. Theresa May vowed to tackle the “burning injustices” in society when she became prime minister was widely criticised for taking so long to appoint a successor to Mr Milburn who quit in December. Recently-appointed Education Secretary Damian Hinds has renewed the government’s commitment by pledging to halve the number of children who start school without basic communication skills by 2028. But Labour have been keen to point out that the Tories have slashed the funding for Sure Start centres by half which were designed to help parents support their kids in the crucial early years.

The Environment Secretary reportedly raised the idea of staying inside the European Economic Area, in a similar way to Norway, at a private dinner of the ‘Green Chip’ dining group of moderate Tory MPs. One MP told the Financial Times Mr Gove “was steering the conversastion towards the EEA idea. There’s no doubt about that”. Allies of Mr Gove denied he was advocating staying in the EEA. One told the Express: “He wasn’t advocating the EEA. “He’s totally behind the prime minister’s Chequers strategy. He’s not considering any other option.”  They added: “He likes discussing things.” Meanwhile, EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier has signalled a willingness to be flexible in Brexit negotiations about the Northern Ireland Border. Fears of a return to violence have been raised if the Good Friday Agreement is damaged by the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. The EU\u0027s suggested solution to the problem - a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU - has so far been rejected by the UK as annexing Northern Ireland.

People have raised fears that some of the topless men and scantily clad women could affect food safety due to them being visibly sweaty.  The discount retailer displayed a notice at the doorway requesting that patrons cover up when shopping in store, reports the Daily Post .  It reads: “For hygiene reasons, we respectfully request that all customers keep their shirts on whilst in the store during the hot weather.  “Thank you for your co-operation and enjoy the sun!” One Aldi shopper agreed with the decision saying: “I can see why they have done it. At the end of the day I don’t want people sweating all over the food I am picking up.” Another said: “It’s off-putting. It could put you off your tea!” One male shopper said: “I wouldn’t do it, not in a food place anyway.” Enforced dress codes are not a new phenomena in UK supermarkets.

Elizabeth Johnson, 23, looks back at her time in secondary school with dread as she was mercilessly bullied for being overweight. Despite the name calling, Elizabeth, from Durham, would hide stashes of crisps in her bedroom to eat in secret - seeing her weight rocketed to 20.5 stone. But Elizabeth, a teacher, finally decided to take action when, at size 26, she dreaded getting in a bikini on a planned beach holiday to Marmaris, Turkey, with a slim university pal. After becoming a regular at the gym and a keen meal-planner, the young woman has dropped to a stunning 11.5 stone - losing the weight in just a year. Elizabeth dropped eight dress sizes and was proud to show off her svelte figure on holiday in a bikini for the first time since aged five in August 2016, even next to her \u0027petite\u0027 pal.  And now the school bulllies who once taunted Elizabeth over her weight routinely chatted up on nights out - but she is always quick to tell them where to go.   Elizabeth, from Durham, said: It\u0027s a massive difference. I am delighted. The funny thing is that since I lost the weight loads of the lads in secondary school that used to call me names and take the mick, they\u0027re always the ones on the night out trying to chat me up and stuff. I tell them where to go straight away. A lot of my friends I had in secondary school I\u0027m not friends with now because since I lost the weight they just drifted away. I think they must have liked me for being the fat friend that was just there. I was the token fat friend in the group. I was able to go on holiday and wear a bikini and everything which I probably haven\u0027t done since I was about five. I used to hate swimming - I just hated it. It was a really nice holiday. My friend is quite petite as well but I didn\u0027t feel out of place. We\u0027ve got loads of pictures and I just look like her. I look the same size as her and everything. It\u0027s hard because it took me a year to lose all the weight and I saw myself in the mirror every day, so even now looking at myself I still feel as though I\u0027m quite big compared to everyone.  But then when I look at a before and after picture it just shows how different I am. It takes other people to compliment me and say I look good because I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a massive change. I\u0027m still the same person - I still have the same personality and like the same things. It\u0027s just my body has completely changed. As a chubby child, Elizabeth had been bullied at secondary school for her weight and always felt like the token \u0027fat friend\u0027 with her mates. She tried dieting and even joined Weight Watchers while she was still at school - but would always give up after a few months and the pounds just kept piling on. At her heaviest, Elizabeth was 20 and a half stone. But that all changed when, three years ago, she and her \u0027skinny\u0027 friends started planning a girls\u0027 holiday abroad. At size 26, Elizabeth was terrified when she realised all her friends would be showing off their figures in skimpy bikinis. Elizabeth said: I\u0027ve always been overweight ever since I was a little girl. Even in primary school I was trying to lose weight. I did get bullied a lot at school, particularly at secondary school. But I remember the local nurse had to come in and weigh the children and I was so stressed about this for months knowing I would have to get weighed at school.  Secondary school was just awful. Absolutely awful. I started weight watchers when I was in secondary school but it just never worked. I was in my second year at university and my friends all decided that we were going to go on a girl\u0027s holiday. My friends are all thin and would be wearing bikinis and stuff. I was a size 26 massive girl. We were going to go in a year, so I thought \u0027I\u0027ve got a year to do something about it\u0027 and that\u0027s when I lost all the weight. Elizabeth teamed up with mum Louise Jobson, 42, to shift the pounds and the pair food shopped and meal planned together to curb their snacking habits. Elizabeth imposed a strict 6pm curfew on eating and stopped stashing crisps and sweets in her bedroom. Louise even joined her daughter the first time she went to the gym - and the young woman was delighted when she lost nearly two stone in just her first month. Elizabeth said: You\u0027ve got to be in the right mind-set to do it. Because I was doing it with my mam and I had her helping me to plan meals and encourage me, it really helps to have someone there because she came to the gym with me for the first time. She\u0027s my best friend. I absolutely love her. I couldn\u0027t have done it without her at all. When I was losing weight I cut down meals and stuff and bulked it out with vegetables and salads. Now because I know that I don\u0027t want to go back to how I was. I still eat how I would usually but then I know I\u0027ve got to go to the gym a bit more. It\u0027s more of an understanding of the balance between what you\u0027ve got to eat and how it affects your body.  My stomach just shrank. I used to eat loads and still be picking on stuff after my tea but now I can eat much less than I used to. I used to eat anything - up to five bags of crisps a day. I absolutely loved crisps, sweets, it was just really unhealthy. I\u0027m not allergic to anything, I don\u0027t not eat any food - so I would literally eat anything that was there. I used to take food and hide it in my room so when I went to bed I would eat loads of crisps and chocolate. I used to stash food so I could eat it in private. I didn\u0027t find it hard to lose weight, particularly after I started seeing results. In that first month I lost so much weight I started thinking I could actually do it.A glam young teacher who lost a staggering NINE STONE after being bullied throughout high school has confessed she now has to knock back advances from the same lads who once tormented her. Elizabeth Jobson, 23, was mercilessly bullied throughout her childhood and describes her time at secondary school as \u0027absolutely awful\u0027.

The Duchess of Sussex turns 37 on Saturday, and we\u0027re hoping Prince Harry is planning something special for the big day including the perfect present. But as a royal, Meghan is also likely to receive lots of other presents from fans and well-wishers around the world - and she\u0027s already been sent her first one. It\u0027s a lovely gift, and it\u0027s something that fits in perfectly with her beliefs and passions.  The animal rights organisation PETA has sent Meghan a \u0026pound290 handbag by designer Alexandra K . The bag is completely cruelty-free and made with vegan leather, and it even has a gold badge on the front which proudly states: This bad is animal cruelty free and vegan. Speaking to OK! magazine , PETA director Elisa Allen said: PETA believes this animal-friendly bag is absolutely perfect for the Duchess, as she is mostly vegan and cares about animals and the environment – in sharp contrast to the leather industry, which, in partnership with the meat trade, kills over 1 billion animals every year. Chances are that this gorgeous handbag will inspire the Duchess to embrace vegan fashion and leave all animal skins out of her wardrobe, as she\u0027s already done with fur.  PETA hopes the gift will encourage the royal family and its fans alike to embrace compassionate brands like Alexandra K and to steer clear of cruelly obtained animal skins. Unlike some of the other presents she\u0027ll be sent, Meghan should actually be allowed to keep this one. As a member of the royal family, there are all sorts of rules surrounding what gifts Meghan can accept. The general rule is that they\u0027re not allowed to accept gifts from people they don\u0027t know. But as it\u0027s been sent by an organisation, she should be okay. The royal family\u0027s website states: The rules state: Gifts from public bodies Members of The Royal Family may accept gifts from government bodies, trade associations, guilds, civic bodies, the armed services, charities or similar organisations in the UK, especially those with which the Member of The Royal Family has an established connection, in the course of official engagements or to mark special personal occasions.    However, if the gift had been sent from the designer it would have been a different story. The website continues: Gifts offered by commercial enterprises in the UK should normally be declined, unless they are offered as a souvenir of an official visit to the enterprises\u0027 premises, to mark a Royal marriage or other special personal occasion. When gifts are accepted, the consent of the Member of The Royal Family should be contingent upon the enterprise undertaking not to exploit the gift for commercial purposes. Gifts, including samples, should always be returned unless it is not justifiable to do so on the grounds of cost. If such gifts are not returned, they should be treated as official gifts.

Colette Tomassi owed more than \u0026pound3,000 in rent to Hull City Council when she was removed from the property on July 10. The 38-year-old single parent was also allegedly booted out because of her behaviour, which the council said had had a “detrimental” effect on the neighbourhood.  After turning down emergency accommodation, Ms Tomassi and her children moved in with a friend in Bransholme and was able to rent two garages in Sheldon Close for \u0026pound18 a week to store her possessions and furniture, reports Hull Live .  However, she can no longer afford the fee and on August 8, she will have nowhere to store her belongings and she fears her family may soon be forced to wander the streets.  She said: “We are at a friend’s flat at the moment but I feel like I am outstaying my welcome and it is putting pressure on his relationship. “We are classed as homeless and I am devastated because I’m 38 and I’ve never been in this situation before. On Tuesday night we all went to sit in the garage at 10.30pm and my little one started crying. “He said ‘I’m not staying here anymore’ and he was crying his heart out. He ran back to the flat and wouldn’t stop crying. It was heartbreaking. “It’s awful to see my children like that and it’s stressing me out because I can’t do anything. We are all crammed into a living room with two on a double mattress, one on the settee and one on the chair with a pouffe.” Ms Tomassi had lived at the house in Porlock Drive for three years but said neighbours often complained about her son’s volatile behaviour which makes it difficult for him to control his anger.  She also suffered a huge health setback after being struck down with a heart attack in December 2016 and diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia – a condition which causes the arteries to narrow. After the heart attack, Ms Tomassi began struggling to pay her rent and due to health problems, she found it difficult to get her children to school on time. She developed anxiety and depression and claims her benefits were stopped with her now only receiving \u0026pound150 a fortnight in child tax credits.  She has appealed the eviction but to no avail and she thinks the council has not supported her enough during her current financial dilemma. Ms Tomassi said: “I just feel like the council haven’t given us a chance. I’ve tried to get the benefits back and I am doing my best but I’m not a miracle worker. “My Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped because I had no address and I need to reapply. Meals are hard to come by and the money I am on isn’t enough. “They want \u0026pound18 for these garages which I can’t afford to pay for and I’ve already paid \u0026pound300 back in rent. “Those garages are like a sauna and it’s not nice having to rifle through black bin bags for our belongings.

The woman, originally from Leeds but now living in the US, recently returned to her childhood home in West Yorkshire and found the 1970s toy in a box. And to her amazement she discovered that Gilly, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed doll still winks, grins and grimaces when its left arm is rotated. A video of the doll\u0027s facial contortions has proved a massive hit on social media - dividing opinion between those who think it is cool and those who have urged her to Kill it with fire. The clip of the Saucy Expressions Doll, brought out by Mattel in 1972, was tweeted by GammaCounter, who wishes to be known only as Alan from Chicago.  Alan, his British-born wife and their two children visit the UK annually but during this year\u0027s trip the toy, bought in 1975, was rediscovered. Alan\u0027s daughter quickly fell in love with her mum\u0027s old doll. Alan posted the short clip to Twitter with the caption: My wife found her childhood doll amongst a bunch of old stuff. Look at the range of emotions it goes through. The clip begins with the blonde doll smiling, but as Alan rotates her left arm the doll\u0027s eyes begin to move from left to right - and her mouth begins to open. As Alan continues to rotate the arm, Gilly winks and her mouth is squished up into a strange expression. The doll\u0027s expressions continue to change, and as her eyes move off to the side her mouth begins to turn down in to a wary expression. The doll then pops back in to a smile, crosses its eyes and opens its mouth in excitement. As the clip ends, a simple wink creates a strange expression on the doll\u0027s face - as one side of her mouth moves upwards while the other moves downwards.  The final expression shows both sides of the doll\u0027s mouth facing down again as it looks wary, and Alan moves the doll in to camera for comedic effect. Scores of twitter users were quick to share their unease over the doll. Debbie Mason said: Chuckie prototype. A lifetime of therapy right there. Muttly added: Kill it with fire and never speak of it again. Ninathedablack commented: Back when dolls were manufactured in the devil\u0027s workshop.

Since she was diagnosed at a few hours old, the teenager has needed to shield her fragile skin with bandages to prevent potentially deadly infection. But she has been taunted by strangers on the street, some of whom bizarrely asked if she was mauled by a gorilla.  And Lucy was traumatised when one of her exes told her he could never be attracted to her because of her skin. However, the Art History and Latin at the University of St Andrews has recently started modelling on the catwalk for lingerie brands. Lucy, originally from Santa Fei in New Mexico, USA, said: I never thought I\u0027d be doing underwear photoshoots. It\u0027s incredible, the comments I have received so far, they have been amazing. Starting to think that someone like me can be associated with beauty can change future women\u0027s perceptions of scarring, similar conditions and more. One of my exes told me he could \u0027never be attracted to me\u0027 because of my skin, it was very insensitive.  The teen, now living in Fife, east Scotland, added: I\u0027m used to comments where people have told me I looked diseased and things like that, so I was trying to change people\u0027s perceptions. So when I was asked to do a lingerie shoot, I did think back to his comment that I could \u0027never be attractive.\u0027 It\u0027s a nice feeling and seeing how I\u0027ve worked on my own body and I love myself enough to put my body out there like that. The catwalk was so empowering, I walked down the first one bare-foot, which I\u0027ve never done in public due to being too self-conscious of my scarring. Lucy often needs bandages to protect her skin as anything from a fall to opening a jar to brushing her teeth can cause open wounds. RDEB even affects Lucy\u0027s eating, as food grazes can appear on her throat. She said: I have had really positive, uplifting comments all the way to the extremely judgemental and callous remarks, as you can imagine.

A landmark study showed insulin-producing cells can be “rebooted” in many cases if weight loss is achieved before the cells have been killed off completely. Previous findings from the DiRECT study released last year showed almost half of sufferers could be cured by a strict diet of nutritional shakes and soups. Foods are then slowly introduced alongside counselling to how to live healthily. If rolled out nationally the scheme could cure at least 1.5 million of the 3.6 million British patients diagnosed with diabetes saving the NHS an estimated \u0026pound4 billion a year. Researchers at Newcastle University measured levels of fat in the liver and pancreas in 41 of the original study participants. Of these 29 were successfully put in remission and 16 were not.  After losing weight the insulin-producing beta cells of people in remission started to work properly again, releasing the right amount of insulin the body needs. Their insulin production continued to improve over the study. There was no change in the amount of insulin being made by non-responders as their beta cells had not survived the stress of being surrounded by too much fat. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, research director at Diabetes UK which funds the trials, said: “DiRECT has already provided evidence to suggest that some people can put their Type 2 diabetes into remission, but we didn’t yet know why. “This latest study builds on these promising findings and helps us understand how weight loss can help some people to kick-start their insulin production again. “DiRECT has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. “We’re still waiting for all of the evidence, so it’s very important that anyone with Type 2 diabetes considering a low-calorie diet speaks to their diabetes healthcare professional first.” "},{"url":null,"title":"black woman accuses home owner","story":"NewsWhite home owner calls the police when black woman sheltered from a storm in her doorwayDarsell Obregon was waiting for an Uber and chose to shelter in a doorway in Brooklyn when it started to rainShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills11:32, 2 AUG 2018Updated11:53, 2 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA black woman has accused a home owner of \u0027white privilege\u0027 after she called the cops when she refused to leave her doorway while sheltering from a storm.

But, in a Facebook post last week, she said had been there no more than three minutes when a woman came out and asked her to leave. Darsell said that when she refused to move,the woman then called the cops. In an ensuing series of videos, the homeowner can be seen on the phone to the police. When the Uber arrives she then heads out, and urges it not to leave, even taking its number plates down.  In her post, Darsell wrote: On Sunday afternoon, I was in Brooklyn walking to the train when a sudden rain storm began and I hid in the doorway OUTSIDE of a random apartment in Park Slope to shield myself from the rain and call an uber. No more than three minutes later a young woman who lives in the building opened the front door and told me that I can not stand there and had to leave. I told her I was not going to move (unbeknownst to her I was just waiting for my ride and would be leaving in a couple of minutes) so then she proceeded to call the police.

But even though we might not have to check our shoes for funnel webs and red backs, that doesn\u0027t mean we want to welcome those hairy, beady-eyed creepy crawlies into our homes. Summer is just not the ideal time if you\u0027re an arachnophobe. Although spiders don\u0027t necessarily prefer our houses to the outdoors, the heat draws them inside as they seek cooler climes - and us keeping our windows and doors ajar to stay cool seems like an open invite. Fortunately, there\u0027s an unlikely ingredient spiders despise that you can use to keep them away.  Apparently a simple essential oil completely puts them off coming inside our houses that doesn\u0027t involve any poison.  Goodtoknow says that peppermint oil is like a repellent for spiders - they absolutely hate it and will avoid at all costs.  All you need to do is grab a spray bottle, put a few drops of peppermint oil in and spray liberally around the house, particularly at potential entry points. It\u0027ll be trial and error at first but apparently should keep them at bay, make sure you dust and vacuum away any cobwebs they may be hiding in first.  Another tactic you can try is to avoid certain colours that attract the creepy crawlies. Scientists used to think that spiders don\u0027t see colour - but according to a new study it turns out that they do and their fave colour is green.

The brewery\u0027s website colourfully describes the sensations customers might expect from the beer saying: Imagine the woman of your dreams, your object of desire. Her charm, her sensuality, her passion.  Now you can try how she tastes, feel her smell, hear her voice. Now imagine her giving you a passionate massage and gently whispering anything you\u0027d like to hear. Now free your fantasies and imagine all of that can be encompassed in a bottle of beer. However, one of the first customers who tasted the beer, Grzegorz Majewski, was not over impressed, saying that at 25 zloty (\u0026pound5) a beer costs the same as a normal bottle of wine.  He said: People will try it out of curiosity, but I don\u0027t think it will be a regular addition on the table for beer lovers. A promotional video made for the beer shows a large brown bottle with a sticker being peeled back showing a photo of a model in underwear with the name Pauline.

In particular, the seaside resort of Benidorm on Spain\u0027s east coast, has proved to be a popular destination for sunseekers. The hot spot, which has reached highs of 33C (91.4F) today, is a favourite for many families who seek value-for-money holidays. However many tourists may have got more than what they bargained for as scenes from the beach show it to be crammed full of holidaymakers. The sandy resort looks so overcrowded that there is barely any space on the sand for jetsetters to walk, let alone sit down and relax.  Hundreds of colourful parasols are pushed closely together along the coast, while sun seekers squeeze their way through throngs of fellow holidaymakeholidrs. Meanwhile the sea is jam packed full of people looking to cool off in the heat, with colourful floats and inflatables crowding the water. And the heatwave isn\u0027t set to cool down any time soon as a new weather model map showed an incoming 50C (122F) heat in Portugal and 48C in Spain. The furnace like heat is expected for 1.5 million Brits on Europe’s hottest day ever on Saturday.    Europe’s all-time temperature record is 48.0C, set on July 10, 1977 in Athens, Greece. Spain’s record is 47.3C, set in 2017. Portugal’s record is 47.4C, set in 2003. Meanwhile the Spanish heat will be blowing to Britain, with the 35C (95F) hottest day for three years forecast. Met Office forecaster Richard Miles said: “48C is the most realistic maximum temperature in inland Spain and Portugal, but there\u0027s a chance it could be hotter. People on holiday should be careful in the heat.

In fact, they happen way more often than most of us think - and the weirdest part is most women have no idea they were even pregnant.  New scientific research claims miscarriage is the most common outcome of becoming pregnant, detailing that most fertilised eggs result in spontaneous abortions rather than developing into healthy babies.  The paper says the majority of miscarriages happen at an early stage in pregnancy, before women even realise they have a baby growing inside them.   William Rice, evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told New Scientist : It\u0027s not an abnormality... it\u0027s the norm.  He said lots of women don\u0027t even know they\u0027re pregnant initially - and because most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, many miscarry without even knowing it\u0027s happening. It\u0027s these unknown miscarriages that make up the majority, according to Mr Rice. In fact, he found that a woman in her 20s is just as likely to miscarry as carry the foetus to term. In the paper, he writes that miscarriage is the predominant outcome of fertilisation and a natural and inevitable part of human reproduction at all ages. Because studies show the miscarriage rate only rises with age, the number of miscarriages far outnumber live births, his analysis details.

It was good.”With a few French speakers already in the squad, it’s been easy for Ngwatala to settle into life at the Dark Blues – and he’s hoping to enjoy some good days with the fans at Dens Park, too.“Everybody is cool, you can speak to everybody, there are no problems.“It helps a lot to have some French speakers but we try to speak English so everybody can understand.“I’ve been surprised at Dens because it was a great atmosphere.“Hopefully, there’s more of that to come.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618b3728549.jpg ","title":"kyle falconer begins nationwide tour at dundee tonight","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis music career started more than 10 years ago and yet Kyle Falconer is still as relevant as ever.The famous Dundonian has been back in the studio and now, just five days after its release, his debut solo album No Thank You has risen to number 16 in the UK album charts.Today marks the beginning of a nationwide tour celebrating the widely-anticipated record and The View’s frontman is kicking it off in his much-loved hometown with a performance at city centre venue, Church.At the weekend he gave friends and family an acoustic taster of the tunes that are already leaving their mark in the music industry.At an exclusive album launch party at City Quay, Kyle was invited onto the stage by none other than Gary Tank Commander – the character made famous by Greg McHugh – who is still pals with the Same Jeans star a decade after they met at a charity gig.Greg said: “Seeing Kyle in the time that I have known him with his child is just incredible.“He seems like a very happy man and for me, listening to the album, that seems to be reflected.“I think the album is fantastic.

light on talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHe feels his squad remains light on numbers and wants to add two or three players before the end of the transfer window in a month.But Dundee boss Neil McCann does like the options he has available to him already.Neil believes the successful Betfred Cup group campaign that’s set up a last-16 tie with Ayr United a fortnight on Saturday, has shown that.That’s the case at full-back where he believes Saturday’s crucial win over Brechin City saw his team particularly strong in that area.He was delighted with the performance of young Australian Jesse Curran, whose work since the players reported back after their summer break has left him regarded very much as a first-team player.The 22-year-old featured in all four group ties, the last two as a starter, and at the weekend was generally regarded as the Dark Blues’ best player.“I thought Jesse was excellent and pushing Cammy Kerr to left-back, I thought he was excellent out there as well,” said Neil.“Jesse was forceful and he gives us that energy on the right side, pushing forward.”The manager has the option of restoring summer signing Nathan Ralph to the line-up for this Saturday’s Premiership opener at St Mirren but the form of Curran and Kerr means it looks likely he’ll have to wait for his first top-team start.The manager still wants to add more goals, he has been pleased by the number of chances being created and the way they’ve been shared around the team.That’s something, along with assistant boss Graham Gartland, he’s been working on.“The way we are pushing our midfielders forward to be more of an attacking threat is giving teams problems.“Paul McGowan is more of an attacking threat, Kharl Madianga continues to be stronger with every game.”Meanwhile, some tickets for the trip to Paisley this weekend are available from the club shop at Dens Park.Already there’s been considerable interest in the game and Dundee have urged fans not to head west without first buying their brief.It’s been confirmed that Betfred clash with Ayr will go ahead on August 18 at 3pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united may be cautious but glass is highly rated at the club","story":"\t\t\t\t\tUntil victory at Elgin City on Saturday – however impressive, it was very much a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted – there is no escaping the fact Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign fell way below expectation.A draw and penalty shootout loss against Arbroath followed by defeat at Ross County, though the performance was decent, meant it was effectively over by the mid-point of the group stage.Going into the home clash with Alloa a week past Saturday, mathematically United could have still qualified but, as the most they could have mustered was seven points, we all knew they were out.In the previous two seasons of the group format, no runners-up had progressed with such a low total and that was to be the case again this time round as Inverness missed out on goal difference despite chalking up three wins.That meant, in some ways, another draw, that was followed by more spot-kick woe against the Wasps, was irrelevant.Except for the fact United were looking for decent performances and results in the lead up to this weekend’s Championship opener against in-form Dunfermline.It meant improvement at Borough Briggs, if nothing else to raise morale among fans, was vital.For that reason the 4-0 success up north was a big result for United and manager Csaba Laszlo who, if not quite feeling pressure, had clearly been perturbed by his new-look team’s sticky start.Csaba’s spirits were lifted by the performance and it allowed him to highlight the contribution of a young player whose displays in the Betfred had been largely lost in the gloom surrounding the first three results.In mentioning teenager Declan Glass, though, the gaffer probably demonstrated his awareness of United’s long history of producing exciting young talent. Not only did he avoid going overboard about the 18-year-old, he went out of his way not to compare him with any of those who went before him.Csaba even stressed the kid, who got his first goal at Elgin, will be developed carefully.That’s a process he started last season when there were those who felt Glass should have been thrown into the team.His boss resisted that temptation and, while we can expect to see him feature regularly in matchday squads this term, he will be used carefully.“Declan is a player from our academy and he has skill. At the moment I want to build him up and slowly give him the chance to show how good a football player he is,” said Csaba.“He has to learn a lot, especially he likes to dribble, but he has to play for the team. On Saturday – and in the previous games – he has a really good shot from the second line. He sees the situation and I think he will be a very good football player.”Even with those cautious words, it’s clear how highly United rate this kid. However much they try to protect him, the more is seen of him, the more it’s likely comparisons with other homegrown talent will be made.Given his eye for a goal and the kind of pass in and around the penalty area that creates opportunities for others, the one recent product of the Tannadice youth policy he seems most likely to be compared with is Ryan Gauld.That would come with a degree of pressure and mean he has big shoes to fill but it could be useful in his development. Talent that he is, in four years since leaving for Lisbon, Gauld hasn’t made the progress expected.That can serve as a reminder to Glass, however eager he is to develop, following his manager’s policy of taking things a step at a time looks certain to be the best way forward.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic lights out on key dundee route","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMotorists have been warned to approach with care after reports of traffic light failure on a key Dundee road.According to the BBC, the lights on Kingway West at the Myrekirk Roundabout are off for folk heading eastbound.\u0026mdash BBC Travel Scotland (@BBCTravelScot) August 2, 2018The lights are \u0026#8220unlikely to be fixed until after morning rush hour\u0026#8221, according to the alert.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/stipe.jpg ","title":"trialist dismayed as dundee decide to let him go","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA trialist has hit out after apparently failing to earn a deal at Dundee.Croatian striker Stipe Plazibat had been on trial with Neil McCann\u0026#8217s men this week in the hope of earning a deal.He featured in a bounce game against Falkirk yesterday scoring a goal and earning an assist.The Dark Blues won the game 2-0.Expressing his frustration on social media the 28-year-old wrote: \u0026#8220Goal and assist in 2:0 win in test match, and still not enough to earn contract [sic].\u0026#8220Don\u0026#8217t know what else to say. 2018 please finish, this become painful!\u0026#8221\u0026mdash Stipe Plazibat (@StipeSP44) August 1, 2018Responding to critics, he added: \u0026#8220Even manager said that he was pleased with my performance but he is looking for \u0026#8216Target Man\u0026#8217 style of player.\u0026#8221Plazibat is a free agent after being released by Bangkok Glass earlier this year.He did not play a competitive game for the side due to Thai rules meaning they could only sign five foreign players and the Bangkok side decided to terminate his deal.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"trust the club and back our team dundee united fans group tells arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA leading member of the Dundee United fans group ArabTRUST has praised the changes made at Tannadice over the summer and urged fans to get right behind the team.Stuart Campbell, who stood down as the trust’s chairman last week to concentrate on his role as an associated director with the club, believes the Tangerines are heading in the right direction.“It’s difficult to know where to start, almost every department at the club has changed over the last few months, we have a team full of new players, improved hospitality and more planned,” he said.“There has been a major change in shareholding, it really doesn’t get more radical than that.“We at ArabTRUST haven’t been immune to the need for change and, as you saw with our earlier announcement of Susan Batten taking over as chairperson, we’ve recognised that and are making the changes that will see us ready to meet the challenges that lie ahead.“ArabTRUST’s view is that we are supportive of the changes made to date but understand that change can be difficult, even painful, especially for the people directly involved and that change sometimes takes time to show the desired results.“Radical change at the club was needed, however, and overdue.“I might be going to open myself up to criticism but we all want the same thing, we want Dundee United to be successful and get promoted this season so, with that in mind, I’d urge everyone to ignore the people who seem to thrive on real or imagined negativity on or off the park.“I really believe the best chance we have of promotion this season is if as many fans as possible get behind the team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

recently completed a 160-bedroom Marriott hotel on the Heriot Watt University campus, just a few miles from Edinburgh Airport.A design and access statement submitted to council planners places the hotel within the context of a wider masterplan for the development of the business park which Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stewart Nicol previously said was \"more slow burn than anybody would want\".It had secured just two tenants between 2011 and last year, before the Co-op also confirmed construction of a new distribution facility there.The site planned for the hotel is currently unoccupied but was previously used for agricultural grazing.Said to be five minutes\u0026rsquo walk from the airport, a new access road will have to be created as part of any development.Inverness economist Tony Mackay previously queried the viability of a hotel at the airport after Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) tendered for a similar development at its Inverness Campus.This week he acknowledged that the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote was continuing to fuel a tourist boom in the Highlands.\"There have been plans for a hotel at Inverness airport for many years but none of them has gone ahead yet,\" he said.\"I think that most of the hotel operators prefer locations in or close to the city centre rather than out at the

They’ve been brilliant – so helpful and really on side.”Jonathan said the branch played a special part in their burgeoning romance.He said: “I met Joanne when she was working there as a barista while she was studying midwifery at Robert Gordon University.“We began going out in April 2016.“I used to come into the Starbucks quite a lot as I was I studying for my professional exams.“To be honest, I was completely oblivious at first – it was my friend that said she liked me.“She would often come across on her break and we got chatting.“That’s really where it all started – the early days of our relationship were in that Starbucks.”Jonathan said friends and family have been slightly bemused by their choice of venue, although they have chosen a more traditional option for their reception – the Marcliffe at Pitfodels Hotel.“The place will be shut between noon and 3pm for the wedding and they’ll be putting up fairy lights and curtains to make it look a bit nicer and like a wedding,” he said.“It’s certainly an unusual choice of wedding venue – I haven’t heard of anything like it before. Disbelief is the most common reaction we get when we tell people where we’re getting married.“The hardest people to win over were our parents who are a bit more traditional.“It took a little bit of persuasion but they’ve come around now.”As the day gets closer, the couple are completing the finishing touches for their dream wedding.Jonathan said: “The nerves are definitely kicking in.“We’re really coming down to the nitty gritty – it’s all becoming very real. But we’re both so excited for the day.”Starbucks regional manager Cindy Ross said: “We are delighted to be hosting the ceremony for Jo and Jona-than.“Jo was a barista here and that’s where she met Jonathan so it was an important place for them.“When she approached us I was over the moon.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b62a59d87279-797x564.jpg ","title":"communities make final touch ups as judges tour begins","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen is in full bloom this week as judging gets under way for a national competition.This year’s Beautiful Scotland is in full swing as the panel makes its way around the eight north-east entries this week.The competition, run in partnership with the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), aims to support community groups across the country as they seek to “improve and enhance their local environment”.While Beautiful Scotland provides the Scottish entrants to the UK-wide Britain in Bloom, as regional winners from last year Aberdeen is already a finalist for the city category.Volunteer judges will assess each entry on three attributes – horticultural achievement, environmental responsibility and community participation, along with this year’s theme of Year of the Young People.Also taking part is Aberdeen Inspired, Brighter Bucksburn, Cove in Bloom, Culter in Bloom, Powis Gardeners, Brighter Bervie and Inverurie Environmental Improvement Group.For the volunteers in Cove in Bloom, the addition of the sculpture of Isie Caie was sure to be a proud moment on the judges’ tour.Group secretary Wendy Suttar said: “We are excited to show the judges the new sculpture of Isie Caie and the community garden.“It has been a bit harder this year with the hot weather, and we have had to water the beds and planters more often.“To prepare for the visit we have just been tidying up – trimming the edges and removing the dead flowers.“We won silver gilt the previous time – our dream would be gold, it would be absolutely marvellous. The competition has really brought Cove closer together.“We just want Cove to look good and we’re pleased it looks so good to walk and drive around.”The gardens of Peterculter were also under the microscope for the Beautiful Scotland judges as they took a two-hour tour of the area with community group Culter in Bloom.Established in 2004, the volunteers took home a Silver Gilt award when it last entered the competition in 2016.Group chairman Erik Stein was keen to show the best of Culter’s new amenities for the judges’ consideration.He said: “A new feature this year will be a striking locally designed stone structure to welcome visitors approaching from Aberdeen, with a colourful display of both annual and perennial plants and shrubs.\u0026#8220We work closely with the city council in our preparations for the visit but we depend heavily on local business support for our finance and on local residents to water our displays, which has been more challenging than ever this year.“However, we have been able to invest in some new ‘self-watering’ containers which have a built-in reservoir, and we have an orchard where the judges can help themselves to strawberries.“We focus on our group motto ‘planting pride in the community’, and encouraging respect for community.”Participants in this year’s Beautiful Scotland will find out if the fruits of their labour have reaped rewards at the awards ceremony in Haddington on September 6.Brighter Bervie hosted the competition judges on Monday this week at 10am and Brighter Bucksburn will kick the weekend off with a visit on Friday at 10am.

He said: “This terrific path enabled my children and I to go on a 20km bike ride from our home in Kintore without having to pop the bikes on the car and drive to a safe cycle route.“Following its opening last Saturday and the planned next stage being Kintore to Blackburn, I am continuing my campaign for a route from Kemnay to Kintore and Inverurie.\u0026#8220Around 67% of the children who attend Kemnay Academy come from Blackburn and Kintore and are bussed there.“This route would allow them to access the school’s leisure facilities and clubs outwith school hours without parents having to taxi them.\u0026#8220I have asked council officers to look into this as the public transport links between our communities are poor and these paths not only benefit cyclists, they also provide a safe route for people to walk and jog.“The proposal has huge support within the local communities.”Mr Reid added: “This idea has been in my head since before I became a councillor.“One of my sons goes to Kemnay Academy and the bus services in that area are not very good, so it gives them limited options for using school services outside of school hours.“It makes sense to link up different Garioch communities and have a more comprehensive network rather than just focusing on the Inverurie to Aberdeen route.”Fellow East Garioch councillor Martin Ford has campaigned for a number of years for the cycle path between Kintore and Inverurie and has said he is pleased to see the route in use.Mr Ford, co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council’s Democratic Independent and Green Group, said: “The works to build the previously missing section of cycle path between Kintore and Port Elphinstone are now largely complete – including the actual path itself.\u0026#8220So the path is entirely useable all the way from Kintore to Port Elphinstone – and is being used, which is good to see.“A complete route for cyclists and pedestrians between Kintore and Port Elphinstone, without the need to cross the busy A96 dual carriageway, is obviously a big improvement.“I am very pleased Aberdeenshire Council has been able to provide this facility.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: “The creation of a shared-use walking and cycling path between Inverurie and Kintore is part of a larger project to develop a dedicated, traffic-free route between Inverurie and Aberdeen via Kintore and Blackburn.“In addition to this long distance route, Aberdeenshire Council is committed to improving walking and cycling infrastructure on a local level through the Integrated Travel Town projects.\u0026#8220The creation of a shared use walking and cycling path between Kintore and Kemnay is something the Council is willing to discuss with communities with a view to potentially developing in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scheme to benefit children","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university has announced its partnership with a new school.Robert Gordon University (RGU) will be working with Lochside Academy, in a bid to widen access to higher education.The scheme is part of ACCESS RGU – an initiative which sees outreach activities delivered across the north-east.

campaign on Saturday against Queen’s Park at Balmoor.Striker McAllister, pictured, is just four goals shy of becoming the division’s record scorer.League Two was formed in 2013 following the merging of the SPL (Scottish Premier League) and SFL (Scottish Football League) to create the SPFL (Scottish Professional Football League).It replaced Division Three as the fourth tier of Scottish football.Former Elgin City man Craig Gunn is currently League Two’s top scorer having netted 55 goals in four seasons from 2013 to 2017.McAllister is on 52 goals having only spent two terms in the division – 2013/14 and 2017/18.Ahead of the new campaign starting McInally has praised his star man and hopes he can overtake Gunn this term.He said: “It would be some achievement for Rory if he can get to that milestone.“We just try to keep him going and keep him doing what he does best.“He’s actually really disappointed with himself right now because he hasn’t scored yet this season in the League Cup.“But with Rory we just need to make sure he’s fit enough to do himself justice because when he’s on the park he will always do well.“We just hope he has another season like he usually has – if that happens we’re never far from where we want to be in the league.“It’s some goalscoring record when you think about it.“He’s 31 now and he thinks about his football a little bit more now.“He’s more responsible with his training and hopefully that can make him better.“I also think playing with someone of Derek Lyle’s experience will also improve his game.”Despite having McAllister, Derek Lyle and Russell McLean as their strikers, Peterhead did not score in four League Cup group stage games against Brechin, Dunfermline, Stirling Albion and Dundee.McInally is not to concerned by that statistic at the moment because his side are creating chances and he believes it’s simply a matter of time before they put some of them in the back of the net.He added: “It’s not something that we’re happy with.“But against Dunfermline we might have scored (they hit the post twice) and against Dundee we might have scored.“Against Stirling Albion we missed plenty of chances even though we didn’t play particularly well.“I think the biggest thing is if you’re not making chances then you would worry.“But it was tough opposition we were playing against, so I just think it’s a matter of time before we start scoring.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"road win lifts kelly from 56th to first in two years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJason Kelly is targeting more road running success after scoring his first major local victory in the 30th anniversary Ballater 10-mile race.The Stonehaven Running Club member blitzed a field of 215 competitors to take top spot in a personal best time of 56min.That performance allows the 22-year-old to claim to be one of the north-east’s most improved runners over the past 24 months when his results are assessed.Kelly first competed in the Ballater race in 2016, finishing 56th in 1:13:16.He returned last year to take third spot behind Polish runner Bartek Osior and Deeside’s Donald Kerridge, but recorded a much faster time of 1:02:25.Now he has lopped a little over six mins from his 2017 performance and 17min in all over the past two years.Kelly said: “I have made a huge improvement but I was surprised to run as fast as I did.“I was maybe a couple of mins faster than I expected to be, so I am very happy with that.“The conditions were ideal and it was a good competitive race from the start, all of which helps produce decent results.”Kelly certainly had to put in a serious shift to earn his victory, with three older and more experienced runners snapping at his heels. Aberdeen’s Tom Brian was just 28secs behind in second position with his clubmate Ben Ward a further 31secs behind in third.Fourth-placed Tom Roche (Insch Trail Running Club) was first Over-40 in 57:18.Kelly added: “There were four of us together for the opening two miles, then Tom Brian and myself pulled clear of the others.“We were shoulder to shoulder all the way to the top of the hill at five miles, but once we entered the off-road technical section of the course I was able to open up a bit of a lead.“When we got back on to the road for the final couple of miles I just pushed it on and managed to get the win.“I’d have to say this is probably my best performance given how hard I had to work and because I got the win over some good opponents.”Kelly believes this result will give him the confidence to go in search of more fast times in the months ahead.He said: “I have a couple of half marathons lined up and I’ll be aiming to improve on my best time of 1:15:55 set at Stirling in April.“I’m doing Nairn next month and possibly the Great Scottish Run at Glasgow in October.“I’ll be aiming to run under 1:15:00 which I think I am capable of doing based on my result at Ballater.“The Glasgow race in particular will have a high quality field so that will hopefully help push me along.“I am also thinking about doing the Leeds Abbey Dash 10km later in the year as it’s a fast course and a stacked field.“I’d also like to do some 3km and 5km races to keep my speed up and hopefully I can gain a few more podium positions.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping.

Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"talented mojo line up announced","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/07/18, 11:51 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 MOJO line-up has been announced.Organisers met recently to choose all the acts \u0026#8211 and it was not an easy decision,  following a large response that highlighted so much talent.And due to the fantastic response, the line-up this year is bigger than before, including one act from last year with hot new material.Some of the musicians who did not make it onto the line-up can be heard between acts, with organisers playing their demo tracks between bands.The acts making the final line-up for Craignish Village Hall, Ardfern on Saturday October 20 are:\u0026#8211 Liam Sommerville\u0026#8211 Stephen Skinn\u0026#8211 The Brambelles\u0026#8211 Citizen 9\u0026#8211 The Hollow Mountain String Band\u0026#8211 4 BelowFull details of the MOJO event will be coming soon and tickets will be available from September 1.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll authors sweep the shelves","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 29/07/18, 12:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTwo authors based in Argyll have released new books.Sue Douglas of Taynuilt and Jennifer Campbell from Lochgilphead have shared their talents with the world, with the release of a book each this week.Career author Sue Douglas’ contemporary romance \u0026#8216If You Can’t Trust the Living\u0026#8217 and novice Jennifer Campbell’s children\u0026#8217s story \u0026#8216Edwin the Wee Elf\u0026#8217 are available online and in good bookshops.To escape unwarranted and adverse media attention, Robin Tyler rents a house in Cushlow Close, a family-owned development of four properties in a remote location.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

five thousand visitors descending on Inveraray Castle for the festival, the six businesses have a fantastic opportunity to raise their profile and sell their products.Now in its fifth year, the Business Gateway Argyll and Bute competition asked business owners to share with the panel of judges why their venture is special and why their products would be a good fit for the festival.The successful businesses who will showcase their products in the Business Gateway sponsored craft tent this year are Keltic Faerie, Janice Bracey Designs, Slate Island Seaweed, Alison McIntosh Prentice, Daisy Rocks Design and Cardross Crab Art.Alison McIntosh Prentice, based in Helensburgh, is an artist who cites the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret as her biggest influence.Using her worldwide travels as inspiration for her art, Alison has a background in graphic and multimedia design but through the years painted as a hobby.Mainly self-taught, Alison now focuses on her art full-time and has exhibited in Barcelona, Wales and Glasgow.Using colours and textures she admired while travelling, Alison’s paintings will be on display and available to buy at a stand within the craft tent at the Best of the West festival.Alison said: \u0026#8216I’ve been attracted to the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret for over 30 years and have further investigated the techniques they used in Gesso artworks which now make up the majority of my work.\u0026#8216The stand at the Best of the West festival will allow me to showcase my art and hopefully sell to those attending.\u0026#8216It’s particularly good timing as I’ve put my travel adventures behind me for now and I’m focusing on being in Scotland and producing the best artwork I can.\u0026#8217The judges included festival host, the Duchess of Argyll, Fergus Murray, Argyll and Bute council’s head of economic development and strategic transportation and councillor Bobby Good,

poppies, thousands of them, to commemorate the centenary of the Armistice.Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church will be decorated with woollen versions of the red floral symbols, but more help is needed if the target of 4,000 knitted poppies is to be reached.The Inveraray pulpit will be draped with poppies and, depending on how many poppies are donated, the rest of the inside of the church will be decorated along with the railings outside the building.The church has around 1,000 already in the bag, but Session Clerk Caroline Wood appealed for knitters around the region to help.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution?

We’ll never know – but hopefully our newspaper will survive to provide some information. For an Ayrshire Post is among items going into a new time capsule at the top of the Burns Monument at Alloway. Also included in the stainless steel capsule is a Clydesdale Bank \u0026pound10 note, with a picture of Burns on it. Poignantly, there’s also a drawing of Robert Burns by National Trust for Scotland volunteer Isla Grant, 17. And there’s a letter by NTS trainee Parris Joyce on what The Bard means to her. Hopefully, the monument will survive well into the future as a result of a near \u0026pound500,000 restoration.  The old capsule turned up when workers removed the gilded urn that sits atop the monument. The urn is being regilded, and a new airtight-sealed time capsule will take the place of the old one. NTS staff suspected there might be an old capsule there.  That’s because of an old letter from a Thomas Hamilton to a John Connel (building contractor) on April 23, 1823. The letter mentions enclosing a hermetically-sealed glass bottle soldered into the tripod, and containing various items. As it happens, the Burns enthusiasts of the time chose a copper container, as the one that came out of the urn was covered in verdigris. Items inside included two Ayr newspapers of the day – an Ayr Advertiser and a West Country Journal – dating from 1816 and 1815 respectively. Although now in a poor state, these appear to have been chosen for stories they carried about proposals for a Burns Monument. The original capsule also contained a silver sixpence depicting George III. Spookily, the urn containing that capsule was erected following a parade to the then new monument on July 4, 1823. And the old capsule saw the light of day again, on July 4 this year.  The monument was built by public subscription and fundraising, and the restoration is also being funded  by donations.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"electrical raiders short circuit ayr","story":"NewsElectrical raiders short-circuit in AyrThieves forced to pull plug on sneak raid at CurrysPCWorldShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:09, 1 AUG 2018Updated13:29, 1 AUG 2018NewsSecurity was breached at the temporary fence on the right (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSneaky thieves used an empty shop to try to reach a lucrative haul of household appliances. They easily got into the half-open unit — then smashed their way into the Currys PC World store right next door. But the hundreds of thousands of pounds of electrical stock inside remained intact. The daring thieves smashed down a fire door to get into the stockroom — but all the expensive items were locked inside metal cages. And they did not get access to the showroom at the front. Store staff called in police at opening time on Saturday after discovering the mess they made. One source said: “This was an audacious attempt to clean the place out of valuable goods including computers, TVs and kitchen goods. “But they got absolutely nothing.” The raid happened in the early hours of Sunday, with the raiders exploiting the empty store next door. It used to be part of the electrical and computing chain, but is being turned into the 24-hour, no-frills PureGym. But access is simply over a seven foot high metal fence. The source added: “There were no extra security measures and no alarms, it was easy to get in and most of the entrance was open to the four winds. “The gang used hammers and cutting gear to batter down a fire exit door. They made a right mess but staff are glad they didn’t penetrate the sales floor.” Police forensic teams remained at the site most of Saturday and a security guard has now been put in place until it is properly secured. Ayr police confirmed the break- in and a spokesman said: “As yet there are no suspects and nothing has been stolen. We will be looking at CCTV and the incident is currently being investigated.” Currys PC World said: “We can confirm there has been no stock loss and the investigation into this incident is continuing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPC and Mac"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable.

Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"ben-saddles-up-to-cycle-coast-to-coast-in-one-day","story":"A PEEBLES man is saddling up this weekend to cycle coast-to-coast across Scotland in a day.\nBen Glasgow will join riders from Edinburgh and South Ayrshire in a charity cycle ride from Prestwick, on the west coast to Berwick.\nThe 37-year-old, who aims to complete his 140-mile journey on Saturday, will travel through Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Peeblesshire and across the Borders.\nThe ride will set off at 6am, and aims to pass through Peebles\u0026rsquo Tweed Green between 1.15pm and 1.30pm.\nThe epic event aims to raise money for three causes \u0026ndash blood cancer charity DKMS Alzheimer Scotland and Cash for Kids.\nThe former Peebles and Edinburgh Northern \u0026lsquoGents\u0026rsquo (over 35s) rugby player started cycling in 2015 after a knee injury put a halt to his regular appearances on the pitch.\nAnd Ben, who works for the Scottish Government, is calling on Peebleans to show their support on Saturday and get involved, as he takes on his longest-ever bike ride.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoAdding another 50 per cent on to the longest ride I\u0026rsquove ever done in one day will be quite a challenge.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not exactly of an aerodynamic build, and the route we\u0026rsquore taking across the width of Scotland features some pretty testing terrain to climb up and over on the best of days for bigger units like me \u0026ndash let alone if the weather conditions and wind decide to conspire against us.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom looking forward to it though, and continuing to raise much-needed funds for a variety of great charitable causes.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.

Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.

The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

Scots who incurred expenses claimed, on average, \u0026pound994.77 in the last year, and the smallest amount they would claim for is \u0026pound8.43, according to new research.  At the top of the list of reasons of Brits who failed to file expenses included deeming the value \u0026ldquotoo low to be worth the hassle and losing receipts.  Half of those who incurred business costs were frustrated at having to pay for them using their own funds before being reimbursed by their company.  More than a third experienced cash flow issues while waiting for their expense claims to be reconciled, with almost one in ten even missing a payment on a personal credit card as a result.  Visiting in-laws, ironing and cleaning the house were all activities workers would rather do than submit their expenses, the team at Barclaycard found.  Personal finance expert, Annie Shaw, described the findings as \u0026ldquoeye-opening.  She added: \u0026ldquoWith some resorting to paying out of their own pocket to cover company costs, it\u0026rsquos clear action needs to be taken to prevent employees footing the bill.

All Sulwaths ales are made and put into casks or bottled on the premises, with visitors able to sample the beers in the brewery reception and bar area.  Fully licensed, the visitor centre is open Monday to Saturday, with tours available on Mondays and Fridays.    Using different blends of hops and barley malts to create the distinct taste of each Sulwath ale, all the beers are made to exacting and labour intensive-standards, to ensure consistency of taste.  The main beers are Criffel Ale, which is an India Pale Ale and is the brewery\u0026rsquos original ale Cuil Hill, a pale amber, light and refreshing session ale and Knockendoch, a dark copper coloured beer, reflecting an increased roasted malt content. Other popular beers include Galloway Gold, a lager, Tri-ball Tribute, a refreshing Blonde ale, The Grace, which is a light coloured mild, and the robust porter/stout, The Black Galloway.

Andrew Chapman, Director of Sales \u0026amp Marketing at Keith Brewery Ltd, said \u0026ldquoWith the two breweries only five miles apart, the merger seems an obvious solution to reduce the duplication of costs across various departments in both businesses.  \"There were a lot of synergies across both companies and it is hoped that both breweries can provide missing pieces of the puzzle to each other, such as staffing, bottling and\u0026nbspkegging facilities, storage and logistics.  David MacDonald, Founder of Spey Valley Brewery, added \u0026ldquoThere has been a great relationship between the two breweries for many years and this move formalises that. It allows both to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our existing customers and gives us time to work on developing new business that would have been difficult to achieve working independently.  It will also allow the brewers at both premises to share knowledge, information and best practise techniques, which is essential when producing the best beer possible.    The merger follows on from the success of both breweries in 2017, with Keith Brewery Ltd\u0026rsquos coffee stout (Stout Keith, 5% ABV) becoming the only Scottish beer to receive the maximum 3* from The Great Taste Guide and Spey Valley\u0026rsquos bitter ale (David\u0026rsquos Not So Bitter, 4.4% ABV) winning Best British Style Beer at the Scottish Beer Awards. Spey Valley are also shortlisted in 3 categories for the 2018 Scottish Beer Awards.  The merger has also seen an expansion across the executive management team with Tony Schofield, formerly of Pernod Ricard, joining as Group CEO.\u0026nbsp There are also ongoing plans to look at the purchase and acquisition of other breweries and on trade premises across Scotland.

This prompted a joke, suggesting that the only remedy would be to set up a brewery. This must be the solution, right?  Three years later, in 1995, we brewed our first ales \u0026ndash Red Cuillin and Black Cuillin. We always knew that these were to be our first two ales - named after the two mountain ranges on the island. They were such a success, we still brew them to the same recipes today. The only difference? The names have changed \u0026ndash we now call them Skye Red and Skye Black.    The choice of names behind our beers are laden with meanings. For instance, the name of our Young Pretender beer was decided upon for its historic associations. Firstly, and most obviously, it was first brewed in 1995, which was the 250th anniversary of the 1745 rebellion. This was the rebellion in which Bonnie Prince Charlie (known as The Young Pretender) attempted to gain the British crown. It was Bonnie Prince Charlie\u0026rsquos historic association with Skye which led us to create our Young Pretender beer.    Our Young Pretender ale has went on to win numerous awards \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoChampion Bitter of Scotland 2016\u0026rsquo and finalist at Great British Beer Festival 2017. However, don\u0026rsquot be fooled, it\u0026rsquos not just Young Pretender winning all the awards. In 1997, way back when, we won the CAMRA (Campaign for Real Ale) Champion Beer of Scotland and we were shortlisted for the UK championship too. To date, we\u0026rsquove picked up over 60 awards\u0026hellipand counting. Not bad for what started as a joke over a few pints.

It praised Transport Scotland\u0027s budgeting, governance, quality assurance, risk management and competitive tendering for the crossing, finding the Scottish Government agency had managed the project well, with \"a clear project scope and the budget included all relevant costs\".  The report stated: \"The team provided regular, consistent and up-to-date information to the project board about costs, risks, quality and timescales.  \"This provided a strong foundation for the project to succeed.\"  However, the auditor also noted it was too early for some of the new bridge\u0027s wider benefits - such as improving public transport across the Forth, cutting journey times and boosting the economy - to be demonstrated.  Transport Scotland has a plan for evaluating progress, including the impact on journey times and traffic flow.  However, the report said \"more detail is required on other outcome measures and when these will be delivered\".  \"For example, how it will assess the impact of improved network connections and junctions, and the project\u0027s contribution to economic growth,\" it added.  Further detail is also needed on public transport benefits, the report said.  \"Transport Scotland now needs to clearly set out its plans on how it will support public transport providers to meet increasing demand for travel across the Forth. This should include actions and timescales.\"  Auditor General Caroline Gardner said: \"There is much the public sector can learn from the way Transport Scotland managed the project and it\u0027s important that the good practice is shared more widely.  \"The management of the project delivered value for money and achieved its overall aim of maintaining a reliable road link between Fife and the Lothians.  \"Transport Scotland now needs to produce a clearer plan about how it will measure the success of the project\u0027s wider benefits, including its contribution to economic growth and improved public transport links.\"  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson welcomed the report\u0027s findings.  He said: \"While it is too early to complete a wide-ranging assessment evaluating the project\u0027s outcomes, we accept the recommendations in the report and aim to carry out a full post-project evaluation in late 2018 detailing performance relating to journey times and traffic flows.  \"This will include an assessment of the impact of improved network connections and junctions, and the project\u0027s contribution to economic growth and exploring what further support can be offered to public transport providers to meet any future increase in demand for travel across the Forth.\"  He added: \"As recommended in the report, the successful delivery of the Forth Replacement Crossing project has provided a number of valuable lessons learned that we utilise in our future work and we will seek opportunities to share these lessons more broadly within the Scottish Government and the broader public sector.\"  The Scottish Greens said that the party would \"continue to press the government to provide our country with a first-class public transport system\".  John Finnie MSP, the Scottish Greens\u0026rsquo transport spokesman, said: \"Before ministers applaud themselves for the report\u0026rsquos findings, they\u0026rsquod do well to remember that Audit Scotland states it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotoo soon\u0026rsquo to determine if public transport has been improved as a result of the bridge opening.\""},{"url":null,"title":"humanist-society-overtakes-kirk-in-wedding-stakes","story":"  The Humanist Society Scotland overtook the Church of Scotland for the first time last year, conducting 3280 marriages, despite humanist weddings only becoming legal in 2005.  The Society\u0026rsquos celebrants leapfrogged the Kirk\u0026rsquos ministers thanks to an eight per cent increase in ceremonies in 2017, compared to a 14 per cent fall in the Church\u0026rsquos marriages.  The figures were released by the National Records of Scotland as part of their annual round up demographic trends in Scotland.  The statistics confirmed a long-term collapse in religious services in Scotland, with exactly half of the 28,440 marriages last year being civil ceremonies.  In 1975, the Kirk conducted 16,849 marriages, the largest number by any organisation, and more than the 13,906 civil ceremonies that year.  However last year, Church of Scotland marriages were down to 3166, compared to the Humanist Society Scotland\u0026rsquos 3283.  There were 1182 Roman Catholic marriages last year, compared to 6,002 in 1975.  Although humanist weddings of all varieties have eclipsed religious weddings for several years, 2017 was the first with the HSS as the biggest single provider.  Former Socialist MSP and convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan recently announced he is training to be a humanist celebrant.  Lynsey Kidd, HSS director of services, said: \"These latest statistics are a major vote of confidence in the charity\u0027s meaningful and personal ceremonies.  \u0026ldquoWe know from couples that it is very important to them to have a ceremony which reflects, and is delivered by someone who shares their beliefs and values.  \u0026ldquoHumanist Society Scotland are now the number one provider of marriage ceremonies, more than any religious group or other belief body.  \"These numbers also reflect a wider trend of a decline in religious identity within the Scottish population. While it is important to recognise that faith plays an important part in a significant number of people\u0027s lives, Scotland has become a nation where it is now the the norm, not the exception, to have a non-religious Humanist approach to life.\"  Rev Norman Smith, convener of the Mission and Discipleship Council of the Church of Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoAlong with our sister churches, the majority of religious or belief\u0026ndashbased marriages in Scotland today continue to be from the Christian faith.  \u0026ldquoWhilst the rise of secularism means that fewer people may choose a religious ceremony, many people still find it meaningful to acknowledge the place of faith in their lives at such an important occasion.  \u0026ldquoWe would encourage anyone considering marriage to approach their local parish minister when thinking about their very special day."},{"url":null,"title":"school-tests-for-five-year-olds-leave-pupils-shaking-and-crying","story":"  The call came after new evidence emerged of P1 pupils \"shaking and crying\" as they took the new literacy and numeracy assessments - which can last up to 40 minutes.  Teacher feedback to the Scottish Government released under freedom of information legislation has highlighted a raft of other concerns including lack of suitable IT equipment and significant loss of teaching time. Parents have also contacted the government to establish whether they can opt out.  One teacher said: \"The fact young children are having to spend hours sat in front of a screen completing these assessments is wrong and goes against all that we know about appropriate learning.  \"Trust teachers to observe and assess children in developmentally appropriate ways rather than endless, meaningless assessments in front of a screen.\"  One senior school manager said: \"My team felt the P1 test was far too difficult, not only in terms of the level of digital literacy required - one pupil actually lifted the mouse in the air like an aeroplane to try and make it work - but also for the way the questions were worded and their level of difficulty.  \"We had one child with additional support needs who triggered severe distressed behaviour as he couldn\u0027t be helped to answer the questions and another P1 who just clicked anything.\"  A headteacher said: \"I feel I have betrayed relationships and harmed them with our children, particularly our most vulnerable, by putting them through these tests.  \"They are completely inappropriate and have left even those children who are flying and are ahead of where we would expect, upset and worried.  \"Less common, but still far more frequent than is at all acceptable, are children who display extreme signs of distress, shaking and crying. Where this happens we stop the test, but by then the damage is already done.\"  Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who submitted the freedom of information request, called on the tests for five-year-olds to be scrapped.  He said: \"Hundreds upon hundreds of complaints now show the chaos ministers inflicted on their classrooms last year, at the expense of tens of thousands of children.  \"The feedback from teachers from every corner of Scotland is brutal. Testing P1s was clearly soul destroying and countless teachers report their classes and learning grinding to a halt for weeks.  \"Teachers have told ministers of their heartbreak at putting their pupils through something which they can see is harming their progress and causing distress. Making those starting P1 this month do the tests cannot be justified.\"  In May, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said he was \"very sensitive\" to concerns about P1 assessments and acknowledged the wider debate, but said the assessments were important to judge progress on closing the attainment gap.  A Scottish Government spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoAssessment is part of everyday learning and teaching.  \"Standardised assessments provide information to help teachers to check progress in early maths, literacy, development and behaviour, and identify where further support may be required.\"  The spokesman said a review of the first year of the assessments, to be published in August, would set out changes to the system for next year.  He added: \"We will continue to listen to the views of teachers and take the action necessary to improve standards in our schools and to close the attainment gap.  The feedback comes after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments for all pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3 as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  There has also been positive feedback on the tests, with one teacher of 17 years\u0026rsquo experience saying: \u0026ldquoPupils ... all enjoyed doing them. There was no stress involved as it was not built up into anything high stakes beforehand.  \u0026ldquoI love to see them so engaged and trying their best. I also find the information invaluable to my teaching and the pupils\u0026rsquo learning.  Another said: \u0026ldquoMost children found it quite enjoyable.

Mr Hunt made the claim in Vienna alongside his Austrian counterpart Karin Kneissl.  However Ms Kneissl, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, downplayed the prospect of the UK and Europe failing to reach a deal on trade and customs by March 2019.  \u0026ldquoFrom the [European] commission\u0026rsquos side there is a clear-cut schedule, so an accident is not really something people are working for, she said, calling her talks with Mr Hunt \u0026ldquoexcellent.  But Mr Hunt was adamant the UK would not blink in negotiations, despite Europe saying parts of the Chequers plan are unworkable and a potential smugglers\u0026rsquo charters.  The UK\u0026rsquos proposal would maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rule book on goods and agri-foods, but avoid current restrictions on services and migration, something the EU regards as cherry-picking.  Mr Hunt said: \u0026ldquoWe have to make a decision on Britain\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU by the end of this year and we have to be very honest with ourselves about the choices that we face. At the moment we are heading for no deal by accident.  Despite Theresa May insisting a no-deal Brexit would be better than a bad deal, Mr Hunt said a no-deal legal and regulatory cliff edge would be a \u0026ldquohuge geo-strategic mistake with \u0026ldquoa profound impact on the relations between Britain and EU countries for a generation.  His comments coincided with Sky News revealing dozens of internal council plans to cope with a no-deal, including preparing for the possibility of social unrest.  Dover District Council and Kent County Council are preparing for a 13-mile lorry park on the M20 southbound for at least four years to cope with tailbacks at ports.  Pembrokeshire is concerned about food supplies, East Sussex fears care staff would quit the country, while Bristol says its top-line threat is \u0026ldquosocial unrest or disillusionment.  One of the most common complaints among councils was a lack of direction from Whitehall.  Kevin Bentley, chair of the Local Government Association Brexit Taskforce, said leaving the EU would have a \"significant impact\" on councils.  The Government said it was \u0026ldquoconfident we will secure a positive agreement with the EU, but was working closely with councils to plan for all scenarios.  Theresa May, who interrupts her holiday tomorrow to visit France\u0026rsquos President Macron to push the Chequers plan, will have to make \"significant\" concessions to get a deal, a respected thinktank said.  The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the PM would have to pay more cash to the EU and accept higher migration, and warned an \u0026ldquoepidemic of uncertainty was already affecting the nation and its economy.  It said a no deal Brexit would end up costing the UK economy \u0026pound800 per person per year in lost output, while even the softer Chequers plan would cost \u0026pound500 per head.  SNP MP Peter Grant MP said the warning had \u0026ldquofallen on deaf ears in Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe comments from the Foreign Secretary that the likelihood of a no-deal is increasing by the day, and that the UK government will not blink in its negotiations with the EU, are unbefitting of the office he holds.

Now she knows what it feels like to watch your stage act, someone might have muttered, but no one was that mean.  This being the first week everyone was on their best behaviour.  Later, comic Syd Little and Ian took pity on jockey Bob Champion, who had never eaten a curry before, and decided to cook a roast chicken dinner.  This meant shopping for chickens.  Real, live ones.

Ms McCarthy said ideally the head quarters would be a functional space like Rockvilla, the new home of the National Theatre of Scotland in Glasgow, rather than an A-listed heritage building.  The Society would keep its well known shop on the Royal Mile, but it would become completely dedicated to retail and box office space.  It owns its other two premises, the sale of which would fund the new HQ.  Ms McCarthy said the Society had already opened talks with asset managers of the City of Edinburgh Council, and the asset managers of the University of Edinburgh.  She said: \"It makes sense on so many levels, we are a small team and we are split over three separate buildings.  \"We work so collaboratively - we have operations, marketing and participation services - but within that there are teams working in all parts, so it is frustrating for us to be in three places.\"  She added: \"We are realistic to know that this is a city where buildings are at a premium, and it has to be the right thing.  \"It has to feel \u0027Fringe\u0027, we are not looking for some precious listed building, we are looking for something functional and workable that people feel welcome when they come into it.\"  Last night the UK Government announced \u0026pound100,000 in funding for the Fringe.  The funding will be used to pay for a \"streamlined accreditation and ticket request system, develop the Edfringe website, and help create an Arts Industry app\" as well proving some money for the project to develeop the new headquarters.  Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: \"The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is an annual showcase of creativity and a global marketplace for emerging talent.  \"It has launched the careers of some of the UK\u0026rsquos finest writers and performers and we want to ensure it continues to go from strength to strength, helping to break new acts here and across the globe.  \"This funding will help the Fringe increase its digital capability, making it even easier for visitors to this world-class event to enjoy everything it has to offer.\""},{"url":null,"title":"drinking-water-quality-in-scotland-remains-high","story":"  The Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland\u0027s latest report shows Scottish Water\u0027s compliance with drinking water standards was 99.91% for 2017, the same as for the two previous years.  The figures are based on 141,097 samples taken at consumers\u0027 taps.  Complaints from people about their drinking water quality have fallen to a record low of 9,239, down from 10,659 in 2016, and half the number reported in 2012.  More than half (51%) of the complaints were about discoloured water.  But the number of samples failing from service reservoirs increased, and three times in 2017 consumers were advised to boil water as a precaution until the problem was investigated.  Scottish Water has increased the amount it spends on maintaining reservoirs as their condition was found to be the reason for more than half of the failures.  Drinking Water Quality Regulator Sue Petch said: \"I am pleased to report that the quality of the drinking water supplied by Scottish Water continues to be high.\"  She added: \"Very high levels of compliance with standards is something that I expect Scottish Water to safeguard and improve upon, through diligent operation, maintenance and investment in their water supply systems.\""},{"url":null,"title":"royal-college-of-midwives-baby-boxes-should-be-given-to-all-new-mothers-in-uk","story":"  The Royal College of Midwives has published a new position statement setting out its support for universal roll-out.  It says the boxes can be a \"positive significant investment\" in early years, and may contribute to reducing inequality.  Baby boxes were made available to all expectant mothers in Scotland from August last year.  In England, some NHS trusts have introduced pilot schemes or full baby box schemes over the last two years.  Wales and Northern Ireland do not have any such schemes.  The boxes, which contain essential items for newborns, are also promoted as a safe place for babies to sleep.  The RCM said provision of the boxes is likely to reduce the risks associated with unsafe co-sleeping, particularly in more deprived communities.  Co-sleeping has been identified as a key risk factor for cot death or sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI).  The organisation also acknowledged there is \"limited evidence\" around baby boxes reducing deaths from SUDI.  Earlier this year cot death expert Dr Peter Blair raised concerns about the promotion of the boxes for sleeping.  Dr Blair, chairman of the International Society for the Study and Prevention of Perinatal and Infant Death, told  newspaper: \"They shouldn\u0027t be advocating infants sleep in these boxes unless there isn\u0027t anything else available.\"  The Scottish Government said its baby box conforms to all relevant safety standards currently in place for a crib or cradle.  The British Standards Institution (BSI) is considering developing a standard specifically for baby boxes.  Gill Walton, of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \"A baby box is a positive gift which signals that every baby is important and welcomed.  \"Providing them will help many families whatever their background, and provide a more equal start to life for the baby.  \"The Scottish baby box contains a number of very useful baby items that can support the health and wellbeing of new babies, including an electronic thermometer, a baby carrying sling, a bath thermometer and a range of clothing.  \"Most importantly by enabling parents to give their babies a safe sleeping space, baby boxes may reduce unsafe co-sleeping or babies sleeping in an inappropriate place such as a sofa.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lottery-winners-revealed-how-couple-scooped-58m-with-a-torn-ticket","story":"  But a message on a lottery terminal in Fred and Lesley Higgins\u0026rsquos local Aberdeenshire shop told them to keep hold of the ripped ticket and call operator Camelot.

Acting Director of Nursing Caroline Hiscox said: “We are delighted that we’ve been able to put together such a comprehensive, advanced level course. “This work has been developed over the past 18 months by two of our Nurse Consultants in Advanced Practice in collaboration with RGU. “Their support and enthusiasm has been invaluable. “Being able to offer a formal paid trainee programme for Advanced Nurse Practitioners demonstrates the value that NHS Grampian places on training and developing its workforce.”                                                                                                        The course is expected to commence in November.

Despite driving visitors nutty and racking up nearly three millon views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD, Mackie\u0026rsquos chose to say goodbye to the UK\u0026rsquos first peanut butter tap in favour of the creamy childhood favourite.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities. The new station, which accompanies Network Rail’s Aberdeen to Inverness Improvement Project, is due to re-open to passenger services in late 2019.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer. The SSE funding will be spent over the next two years. After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years. It\u0026rsquos the town\u0026rsquos harbour and while its use has changed over the last few years, it\u0026rsquos still very important.\"It\u0026rsquos of historical significance.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Thursday 2 Aug 2018 5:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The additional activity generated will create high-skilled jobs and encourage foreign direct investment.\"The Sutherland site could be operational by the early 2020s, creating hundreds of jobs through the use of innovative rocket technology to delver a cost-effective launch service.The UK Space Agency selected Sutherland because Scotland is the best place in the UK to reach highly sought-after satellite orbits with vertically-launched rockets.Thursday 2 Aug 2018 5:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure.

As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"115 north road lerwick 2 ","story":"OFFERS OVER £320,000\nEnjoying a commanding position and having the living area on the first floor affords this 2 storey house stunning panoramic sea views over Lerwick Harbour.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nThursday 2 Aug 2018 5:37 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sleat-and-Strath.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

In fact, they were onaverage only nine years older than me.\nTheintensity of political struggle distorts the significance of age difference.Ten to 15 years between comrades can sometimes seem like an age.\nI saidthis recently to Jim Gibney as we talked about Ronnie Kasrils’ visit.\nRonniewill be 80 years-old this November. He has spent all of his life as a politicalactivist.\nBut helooks, and interacts socially, like someone much younger.\nBeforehe came to Ireland he inquired about the current ages of my own children.\nI jokedthat as they were getting older I was getting younger!\nHereplied that of course I’d be getting younger, because ‘The struggle keeps usall alert and in fine fettle.\nI firstbecame aware of Ronnie Kasrils in 1992 when the march on Bisho occurred duringthe phase of mass action in South Africa.\nHe wasinterviewed on international news as one of the key leaders and was veryarticulate.\nTheSouth African national liberation struggle was at a decisive period. Historywas clearly being made.\nSomeyears later in 2004 as Sinn Féin\u0027s Northern Chairperson Iproposed we invite an ANC representative to Ireland as part of the Cúige’s Céad (centenary) celebrations.\nThe Cúigeleadership agreed.\nBy thenRonnie Kasrils was the South African Minister of Intelligence.\nSo Ichanced my arm and sent off a letter more in vain hope than any realexpectation.\nRemarkablyRonnie wrote back accepting our invitation to visit Ireland, and, would do soas a representative of Thabo Mbeki’s government.\nNeedlessto say we were delighted (and, the Cúige had just been saved a fortune of moneyin plane fares!)\nAtremendously successful programme of events was organised and Ronnie Kasrilshad a big impact everywhere he visited and spoke.\nHe andother South African comrades returned the following year to share the ANC’sexperience of transition in government as we launched the big debate within therepublican base on policing.\nVerymany comrades have vivid memories of Ronnie’s contribution to our internalpolitical discussions during this period.\nHe alsoattended and addressed Ard Fheiseanna with his then wife Eleanor and thenafter her untimely death in 2009 he wrote a brilliant book about her own rolein the liberation struggle entitled the ‘Unlikley Secret Agent’.\nHislatest book ‘A Simple Man’ is a compelling critique of current day SouthAfrica.\nRonniewas a senior figure in the collective leadership of the ANC MK, or Unkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) and the South African Communist Party, as well asa Deputy Minister of Defence, and later Minister of Intelligence in SouthAfrica.\nThe newbook provides an analysis of the ANC’s transition from resistance to powerwhich is essential reading for all political activists.\nJoeSlovo, the former MK Chief of Staff, said to Ronnie Kasrils towards the end of1994 that very few people had enjoyed the unique privilege of serving in aliberation struggle and then in government as they had.\nAs acommitted internationalist he has consistently stood in support of the peopleof Palestine, Cuba and freedom loving people across the world.\nHe hasmade an important contribution to the Basque peace process.\nAlongwith others in South Africa he has strongly supported the Irish peace process,and Sinn Féin’s work to achieve an agreed, united Ireland.\nDuringtwo speaking engagements in Belfast and Derry he kept the audiences enthralledwith his political analysis. They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics. The humanity of your peopleand their commitment is so tremendous.\nWe allneed to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadershipand determination.\nHeroworship is something altogether different. That’s the stuff of sycophancy andthe notion that the celebration of personality is the end itself.\nThephrase that “we stand on the shoulders of giants” refers to those who have gonebefore us, but left a legacy of inspiration and leadership by example.\nThisSunday the National Hunger Strike commemoration will take place inCastlewellan, County Down.\n\nTheIrish Hunger strikers are now among a pantheon of iconic Irish andinternational figures who symbolise the struggle for a better world alongsidethe leaders of 1916 Mary Ann McCracken Nelson Mandela Ché Guevaraand Ho Chi Minh.\nBertoltBrecht the socialist poet wrote:\n      “There are those who struggle for a day and that is good\n                There are those whostruggle for a year and that is better\n                And there are those who struggle for twenty tears and that is better still\n  Then there are thosewho struggle all their lives, and they are the ones we cannot do without”\nRonnieKasrils continues to politically campaign enthusiastically for a better worldeven while approaching the autumn of his life.\nThestruggle for Irish unity, independence, and an Ireland of equals has beenenriched by his friendship and solidarity.\nSinn Féin and other progressives inIreland are proud to call him our comrade and our friend.    \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

after sustained campaigning by trade unions against the privatisation of waste collections in parts of Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, claims are emerging that bins are going unemptied.\nA number of social media posts have been made by the council in recent weeks and months, advising that bins have not been collected on their allotted days.\nLast November, the decision to outsource some waste collection services to a private firm was met with outrage.\nTrade unions said that it could lead to greater privatisation of council services, less pay for workers and job losses.\nOne whistle-blower told the Antrim : An issue arising is lack of staff in Antrim to fulfil bin collections in the Antrim area due to allowing staff to leave on severance after privatisation and the inability to get former Newtownabbey staff to move to Antrim. \n\u0026#8220They simply refuse to move and are being paid to do nothing except perhaps to use council vehicles to drive around aimlessly or on private business with no sanction -

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"1400 teachers made redundant in northern ireland over past","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Principals have told me explicitly, unless something is done immediately, they have no option but to made staff redundant as they try to balance their books.\n\n\"Education here is in crisis and these figures underscore this. We cannot let education here die a death by a thousand cuts and the public, teachers, and staff deserve a lot better.\"\n\nLondonderry\u0027s Lisneal College principal Michael Allen said the education system is \"in crisis from top to bottom\".\n\nHe said the political deadlock is adding to the problems, with big decisions not being made.\n\n\"The lack of Stormont definitely isn\u0027t helping,\" he added. \"We don\u0027t have an Education Minister. Any concerns we have, who do we go to now? No one is prepared to make decisions. We do need a government. We need Stormont back in place, because we need leadership.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Education said: \"School-based redundancies are on a voluntary basis, and funded by the Public Sector Transformation Fund as part of a range of measures to help schools manage their budgets. \n\n\"This funding was agreed by the Executive under the terms of the Stormont House Agreement in 2014. Therefore the absence of a minister has not impacted.\n\n\"The school building programme has continued in the absence of an Assembly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gay catholic mp married to northern ireland man to address belfast event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Int\u0027l NI (@AmnestyNI) \nJuly 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK in which same-sex marriage has not been legalised due to opposition from its largest party, the DUP.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland voted to allow the ceremony in 2015.\n\nTheresa May’s Democratic Unionist allies hold that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman and have used a parliamentary mechanism at Stormont to veto efforts to legislate.\n\nWhen the now-suspended Assembly was operating its members voted in favour of change while public opinion polls show a majority of above 70% back social liberalisation.\n\n\nAmnesty Belfast Pride Lecture 2018 \n\nTickets going fast but available here: \nhttps://t.co/N5XxFAo7wk\n \n@belfastpride\n \npic.twitter/nXaFp1JEhG\n\n— Amnesty Int\u0027l NI (@AmnestyNI) \nJuly 26, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Killen will say there is also a clear majority at Westminster who would vote to extend the right of marriage in Northern Ireland in the absence of a devolved Assembly in Belfast.\n\n“The opponents of same-sex marriage seek to impose a minority view on the LGBT community in Northern Ireland through a technicality.\n\n“Under these circumstances, it is anti-democratic not to legislate for same-sex marriage and Westminster has a moral and a democratic obligation to do so.\n\n“Instead of facing a vote, they now run away, using cheap parlour tricks and the machinations of parliamentary processes and the petition of concern to deny the will of the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n“It can only be described as one thing, a stitch-up to prevent people from claiming their rights.”\n\nHe urged the Prime Minister to decide whether her deal with the DUP to prop up the minority Government, which preserved her “fragile” grip on power, was worth perpetuating ongoing discrimination against the LGBT+ community in Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Killen has previously acknowledged that his relationship with religion had not always been an easy one.\n\nIn 2012 he wrote to the then head of the Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, challenging him on anti-LGBT comments he had allegedly been making in the media.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament website lists ian paisley as independent","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair cancellations leave northern ireland florist stranded for five days","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

My daughter, who was waiting to pick me up in Belfast, knew more than I did,\" she said.\n\n\"There was chaos in the airport, but I managed to make it to the gate and that\u0027s when a voice over the tannoy told us the flight had been cancelled.\"\n\nMs Suett, who had been visiting family after holidaying in Cyprus, was advised to collect her luggage, leave the airport and book a new flight home - but the next available flight wasn\u0027t until Tuesday.\n\n\"I just accepted it as one of those things and informed my employer that I would not be back in work until Wednesday,\" the mum-of-one said.\n\nBut the Greenmount College lecturer never made it to work yesterday either, after Ryanair cancelled her rescheduled flight home on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nMs Suett said she was left baffled by the reason cited by the low-fare airline.\n\n\"I couldn\u0027t believe it when they cancelled the second flight,\" she said. \"But I was more shocked that they blamed it on the weather.\n\n\"There had been a few thunderstorms in the early part of the morning, but my flight was in the afternoon when the sun was shining.\n\n\"It\u0027s a bit of a mystery, because Ryanair was the only company cancelling flights that day\".\n\nShe said she had not been offered compensation, branding Ryanair \"a shame and disgrace\".\n\nA Ryanair spokesperson said it was \"forced\" to cancel flights on Tuesday due to adverse weather disruption, which was not exclusive to the airline and meant no compensation is due.\n\nIt said any suggestion that Ryanair was the only company affected was \"entirely false\".\n\nBut a spokesperson for Stansted Airport confirmed that Ryanair was indeed the only company to cancel flights on Tuesday.\n\n\"It is up to Ryanair to explain why they chose to make that decision,\" they added.\n\nThe disillusioned passenger finally arrived back home last night after ditching the airline for one of its main competitors.\n\n\"They have completely destroyed all trust, so I couldn\u0027t take another chance,\" Ms Suett said.\n\n\"I had to pay £250 for an easyJet flight on top of the additional expenditure over the last few days and loss of earnings.\"\n\nMs Suett has vowed to never again rely on the Irish company which, she claims, ruined a precious family reunion earlier this year.\n\n\"I was on my way to celebrate my sister\u0027s 70th birthday and my mum, who suffers from dementia and lives in a care home, was going to be there,\" she recalled.\n\n\"It was just one of those valuable moments when we were all going to be together - there might not be many of those left.\n\n\"But after a 19-hour delay in Belfast I knew I\u0027d missed it, I just gave up and went home.\"\n\nThe Girls Brigade leader, who also missed an important planning meeting due to the disruption, said there is \"no excuse\" for how the company has acted.\n\nHundreds of passengers across Europe have been sharing similar experiences online as the company contends with air traffic control staff shortages in some of its main travel hubs - 25% of Irish pilots are due to take part in a fourth strike tomorrow, causing even more cancellations.\n\nScott Kennerley, head of transport policy at The Consumer Council said air passengers impacted by delays or cancellations may be entitled to assistance and in some cases compensation. \n\nAnyone who wants to know more about their passenger rights or who needs help making a complaint can contact The Consumer Council on 0800 121 6022 or visit www.consumercouncil.org.uk. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein and dup clash over bid to rekindle stalled northern ireland talks","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The rhetoric of \u0027no, nay, never\u0027 gets no one anywhere. \n\n\"This is now about progress, about recognising people\u0027s entitlements. These are issues that are not orange and green, these are people issues, rights issues.\"\n\nThe Sinn Fein president said she wanted to talk to the British and Irish Governments to ascertain what shape future talks would take. \"We will enter any process in good faith, but we have to be sure that it has the prospect of delivery,\" she said. \n\n\"We are a party of engagement. I have said all along that despite the stance that the DUP and their very destructive and reckless agenda, there is no doubt that early or late, all of this brings us right back around the table talking to each other again. There is no other way forward.\"\n\nOn Tuesday Leo Varadkar said: \"We would intend, in the autumn some time, trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together. \n\n\"The absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult, but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity, certainly before the end of the year, to get the Assembly and Executive up and running.\" \n\nMrs Foster yesterday said she wasn\u0027t aware of any such proposal and had not been informed of any by London. \"We haven\u0027t heard from our own Government in relation to this, all we\u0027ve had is comments from the Irish Republic\u0027s Government,\" she told BBC Radio Ulster.\n\n\"That does cause me concern because in the last round of talks, the Irish Government tried to interfere in strand one issues (issues related to Northern Ireland\u0027s internal government). \n\n\"We had to push back a number of times and say to them that, in relation to the internal matters of Northern Ireland, those are matters for the UK Government and the parties in Northern Ireland. As I understand it, there isn\u0027t a proposal at the moment, there are just comments made by the Irish Government.\"\n\nMrs Foster accused Sinn Fein of ducking its political responsibilities.\n\n\"Instead of attempting to work for any agreement locally, Sinn Fein chose to walk away and boycott the Assembly, Executive and House of Commons. Forums that could give them some influence,\" she said.\n\n\"On Brexit and on devolution, is it easier for Sinn Fein to reduce themselves to little more than lobbyists rather than engage in the real business of politics and take tough decisions on behalf of everyone?\"\n\nIn response to Mr Varadkar\u0027s comments on new talks, a UK Government spokesperson said its top priority was \"the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland\".\n\nLondon would work with local parties and Dublin \"within the three-stranded approach\" to remove the barriers to restoring the Executive and a fully-functioning Assembly.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"union jack a flag of convenience for parts of dup leadership says lord adonis","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Last month, the budget airline criticised the strikes as unnecessary and warned that if they continue, there could be job losses.\n\nTrade union Forsa, which represents the pilots, hit out at the airline company following the warning.\n\n\n\nIn the 19 days since the first one-day strike took place, company management has agreed to just two hours of talks, despite Forsa’s repeated assurance that it is available for discussions at any time\nForsa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said that the pilots continue to seek a “fair and transparent method” to govern base transfers and related matters which they say is common practice in the industry.\n\nIn a statement, Forsa said on Thursday: “For over a month, the union has said that industrial action is likely to continue until there is substantial movement on the pilots’ reasonable demands for an agreement on a fair and transparent approach to base transfers and related matters.\n\n“In the 19 days since the first one-day strike took place, company management has agreed to just two hours of talks, despite Forsa’s repeated assurance that it is available for discussions at any time.\n\n“The union has today told Ryanair that it remains available for talks.\n\n“The airline’s escalation of the dispute last Wednesday when it threatened to sack 100 pilots and 200 cabin crew, or transfer them to Poland – led to a predictable hardening of resolve among its staff.\n\n“Company management met the union the day before the first one-day strike, and two days before the second one-day strike (on July 18). It then changed its position and said it would not negotiate while strike action was planned.”\n\n\nRyanair today (Thurs August 2) asks FORSA to confirm they will meet us at 11am on August 7. \nhttps://t.co/ZAZMVweLpe\n\n— Ryanair (@Ryanair) \nAugust 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe union said that two weeks have passed since their last meeting with management and warned that a resolution to the dispute cannot be reached if the airline has “precondition” talks.\n\nThe union added: “On a number of occasions in recent weeks and months, there have been suggestions that third-party facilitation could assist in reaching consensus on issues of disagreement.\n\n“Forsa has today repeated to the company that it is willing to explore this option.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"first fully electric rail service operating on edinburghglasgow line","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

two cities by up to a fifth – although managing director Alex Hynes said in May it will be 2019 before all services on the route are cut to 42 minutes.\n\nManufacturer Hitachi is building 70 of the trains, which will also be introduced on other routes across central Scotland in the coming months.\n\nMr Hynes said: “Delivering a fully electric service on our flagship Edinburgh to Glasgow route is another major milestone for Scotland’s railway.\n\n“A fully electric service means smoother journeys, more seats and better services for our customers – and a greener railway.\n\n“It’s all part of our plan to build the best railway Scotland has ever had.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"here is how northern ireland ranks in uk for lottery luck","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

is again home to winners of a life-changing National Lottery prize but the South East remains the area with most of the games’ millionaires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nSome 691 Lottery millionaires live in the South East, just ahead of the Midlands with 687, according to Camelot statistics on where winners lived when they made their claim.\n\nThe bad news for would-be millionaires in Northern Ireland is that it is the region of the UK with the least winners. \n\nThe province sits at the bottom of the table with 117 winners of £1 million or more and 748 of £500,000 or more.\n\nThis no doubt may have something to do with the population of Northern Ireland being much smaller than other regions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe Midlands just edges out the South East as the home of winners of £50,000 or more – at 5,705 ahead of the South East’s 5,221.\n\nScotland is still home to the largest lottery win claimed in the UK – £161 million, won in 2011 by Colin and Chris Weir from Largs in North Ayrshire – and to 472 other winners of £1 million or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin and Chris Weir celebrating in 2011(Lynne Cameron/PA)\n\n\n\n\nNow it adds Fred and Lesley Higgins, from Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, who have scooped a EuroMillions win of £57,975,367 from the draw on July 10.\n\nLondon is home to 611 winners of £1 million or more, followed by the North West with 595.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFred and Lesley Higgins have won more than £57m (Andrew Milligan/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe postcodes where players are most likely to win a major National Lottery prize, according to statistics most recently updated in May last year, are Cleveland (TS) and Romford (RM), closely followed by Warrington (WA), Liverpool (L), Newport (NP) and Newcastle (NE).\n\nThe postcodes are ranked by the number of major prizes of £50,000 or more won per head of adult population since the National Lottery began.\n\nThe TS postcode, which includes Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees, has more winners per head than anywhere else in the country.\n\nThe statistics, which include both publicity and non-publicity winners, reveal the top 10 postcodes are:\n\nTS – Cleveland\nRM – Romford\nWA – Warrington\nL – Liverpool\nNP – Newport\nNE – Newcastle Upon Tyne\nME – Medway\nSR – Sunderland\nWN – Wigan\nBR –

NHK said female applicants’ scores were slashed by about 10% in some years.\n\nThe allegation surfaced during the school’s probe of a separate scandal in which its former director was accused of granting admission to the son of a top education bureaucrat in exchange for a favour.\n\n\n\nEntrance exams that unfairly discriminate against women are absolutely not acceptable\nEducation Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school’s public affairs department said officials were surprised by the Yomiuri report and had no knowledge of the reported manipulation. It promised to look into the matter.\n\nYoshiko Maeda, head of the Japan Medical Women’s Association, said it was astonishing that women in Japan are still being stripped of their right to seek entry to the medical profession.\n\n“Instead of worrying about women quitting jobs, they should do more to create an environment where women can keep working,” Ms Maeda said. “And we need working style reform, which is not just to prevent overwork deaths, but to create a workplace where everyone can perform to the best of their ability regardless of gender.”\n\nIn Japan, many women are college graduates but face discrimination in hiring and pay. Long working hours and lack of support in child rearing from their husbands often force them to give up their careers.\n\nAs Japan’s population ages and birth rates remain low, many workplaces including hospitals are chronically short staffed.\n\nEarlier this year, a Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry panel urged medical institutions to allow more flexible working environments and support for female doctors so they can return to work after maternity leave and balance work and family.\n\nWhile women account for more than 40% of the overall workforce, the share of female doctors who have passed the national medical exam has plateaued at around 30% for more than 20 years. The slow progress in medicine has prompted speculation among some doctors about possible widespread interference in the school admissions process.\n\n“Entrance exams that unfairly discriminate against women are absolutely not acceptable,” Education Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters. He said the ministry will decide on its response after receiving the results of an investigation from the school.\n\nIn Japan, medical graduates usually end up working at school-affiliated hospitals.\n\nAccording to the Yomiuri, the school started to restrict the portion of females in each class to about 30% by manipulating the test scores to get more women to fail.\n\nAdmissions records released to The Associated Press by the school show the percentage of women who passed the entrance exam rose from 24% in 2009 to 38% in 2010. The figure has since stayed below that level until decreasing to 18% this year.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"zimbabwe opposition urged to lose graciously as election results due","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We believe in transparency and accountability, and those responsible should be identified and brought to justice.\n\n3/6\n— President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) \nAugust 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe conciliatory remarks came a day after soldiers shot live rounds and beat demonstrators, many of whom threw rocks and set fires to protest against alleged election fraud. The government has said three people were killed.\n\nWednesday’s violence erupted after the electoral commission said the ruling Zanu-PF party won a majority in parliament. The commission has said the vote was free and fair.\n\nA credible vote is crucial to the lifting of international sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that its collapsed economy can recover. Elections under Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule were marked by violence against the opposition and alleged fraud.\n\nMr Mnangagwa called for an “independent investigation” into the violence in Harare, saying those responsible “should be identified and brought to justice”.\n\n\nWe have been in communication with Nelson Chamisa to discuss how to immediately diffuse the situation, and we must maintain this dialogue in order to protect the peace we hold dear. \n\n5/6\n— President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) \nAugust 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights activists and some international observers criticised the military for opening fire on unarmed civilians in what they said was a disproportionate reaction to the protests and rioting.\n\nSoldiers fired “randomly” and beat up bystanders who were not involved in the protests, said the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.\n\n“Yesterday’s events leave ordinary citizens with serious doubts that this government is any different from its predecessor, if not worse,” the forum said, referring to the long rule of Mr Mugabe, who resigned in November under military pressure.\n\nThe new joint statement by international election observers from the European Union, US, Commonwealth, African Union and others expressed “grave concern” over the deadly violence and denounced the “excessive use of force” used to calm the protests. It urged Zimbabwe’s army and police to use restraint.\n\nThe military deployment was the first time that soldiers had appeared in the streets of the capital since Mr Mugabe’s departure in November. At that time, thousands of jubilant residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.\n\nNow some Harare residents, standing amid the shattered windows of Wednesday’s violence, expressed frustration and exhaustion.\n\n“We are tired of these people. They have to go, they have to go, the Zanu-PF regime,” said a 23-year-old who gave his name only as Elliott. “Because 29 years of oppressing the people of Zimbabwe, we are tired, we are saying we are tired.”\n\nAnother resident, 29-year-old Sifas Gavanga, said: “We are a peaceful nation. We don’t deserve the death we saw that happened yesterday.”\n\nZimbabwean authorities now say the military will remain in the capital until “this situation is over”.\n"}]
