[{"url":null,"title":"Muslim leaders condemn minute lockdown announcement","story":"Share this article Lord Lamont, the Tory ex-chancellor, last night urged ministers not to lose focus on the economic recovery and warned them against taking blanket measures across the whole economy.He said: \u0027The one thing we cannot afford is another total lockdown. The economy has got a long uphill struggle.\u0027 The Mail revealed earlier this week how the Prime Minister is \u0027extremely concerned\u0027 about the possibility a second spike of infections could start in the next two weeks. His remarks in recent days come in stark contrast to his message a fortnight ago when he expressed hope that all social distancing restrictions may be ditched in time for Christmas.Yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted Britain has had \u0027massive success\u0027 in bringing down mortality rates but warned: \u0027I have to tell you we\u0027re looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries, you can see what\u0027s been happening in the United States.\u0027So it is absolutely vital as a country we continue to keep our focus and discipline, and that we don\u0027t delude ourselves that somehow we\u0027re out of the woods or that this is all over, because it isn\u0027t all over.\u0027Despite the rise in the level of infections, the numbers are still way below the peak on May 1 when 6,201 cases were confirmed in just one day.Mr Smith, whose Crawley constituency includes Gatwick Airport, last night said: \u0027Testing should play a much larger role in giving people confidence to travel.\u0027Do I have to cancel my wedding? Can I still celebrate Eid? Your questions answered as 4.5million people in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Yorkshire are hit by new lockdownWhat has the Government announced?Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night that people from different households in Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire will be banned from meeting each other in their homes and in their gardens from midnight.Which areas are affected?The new restrictions apply to the whole of Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire including Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale as well as Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire.The same restrictions will also apply to Leicester, which saw the first so-called \u0027local lockdown\u0027 imposed on June 29.What does this mean for the people living there?The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that the new measures will mean people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households outside those in their support bubbles in private homes or gardens.Households will be able to go to bars, pubs and other hospitality venues but two households should not go together, the department added.The DHSC said that restrictions currently in place in Blackburn which saw indoor swimming pools, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports facilities remaining closed will continue.Why is this being done?In a series of tweets Mr Hancock said that there had been an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England.He said that this was due to \u0027households gathering and not abiding by the social distancing rules\u0027 and the new rules were being put in place in order to \u0027keep the country safe\u0027.How will the restrictions be enforced?The Government said it will sign new regulations to make the changes \u0027legally enforceable\u0027 and will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions.How fast is the virus spreading?According to the most recent figures from Public Health England (PHE) the rate of infection is increasing across 13 of the 19 local authorities in the areas where the new measures are being imposed.In Blackburn with Darwen, the rate has risen from 83.3 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 20 to 89.3 in the seven days to July 27. A total of 133 new cases have been recorded.Leicester has the second highest seven-day rate despite it falling from 67.8 per 100,000 people to 60.2 over the same period, with 214 new cases.Over the same period the rate has also increased in Manchester, Burnley, Pendle, Bradford, Calderdale, Oldham, Bury, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, but fell in Hyndburn, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bolton and Rochdale.Rochdale, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have been on a PHE watchlist as an \u0027area of concern\u0027 after elevated rates of infection.What is happening in Leicester?The DHSC said that from Monday restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can open again in line with the easing of restrictions across the rest of the country on July 4.Leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed but cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place, it added.The department said that all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end.But Mr Hancock said that the restrictions on social gatherings imposed on Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire would also apply to the city of Leicester.Does my household include close family members?Your household – as defined in law – is only the people you live with. If you have formed a support bubble (which must include a single adult household i.e. people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) these can be treated as if they are members of your household.What will be illegal?It will be illegal for people who do not live together to meet in a private home or garden, except for limited exceptions to be set out in law. You should not host or visit people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble. If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone\u0027s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.Can I still meet indoors with people in my support bubble?Yes. Where people from single adult households (people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) have formed a support bubble with another household, they can continue to visit each other, stay overnight, and visit other public places as if they were one household.Can I still meet people outdoors?In line with the national guidance, you can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. You cannot meet people you do not live within a private garden.At all times, you should socially distance from people you do not live with – unless they are in your support bubble.I live in this area. Can I still meet with my family and friends to celebrate Eid?Due to higher rates of infection, if you live in this area you should not host or visit friends and family in each other\u0027s homes or gardens. It will shortly be illegal to do so, unless specific exemptions apply. You also should not meet friends and family in other venues – including restaurants or cafes.Up to two households, or six people from any number of households may meet outdoors (excluding people\u0027s gardens) where there is a lower risk of infection. If you do so, you should still socially distance from those you do not live with, and avoid physical contact.You may attend a mosque or other place or worship, where Covid-19 Secure guidance applies, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings). We recommend at this time that, if possible, prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can I still go to work in this area?Yes. People living inside and outside of this area can continue to travel in and out for work. Workplaces must implement Covid-19 Secure guidance.I live in this area. Can I still go to cafes, restaurants, the gym and other public places?Yes. But you should only go with members of your own household – even if you are going outside of the restricted area.I live in the area. Can people from outside of the lockdown area visit me at my house?No. This will be illegal.Do I still have to shield if I live in this area?Clinically extremely vulnerable people will no longer have to follow the shielding guidance from the 1 August, unless they live in Blackburn with Darwen in the North West and other local affected areas across England where shielding continues.Can I visit a care home?You should not visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances. Care homes should restrict visits to these circumstances.Can I still have my wedding if it\u0027s in the lockdown area?Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies in these areas can still go ahead. No more than 30 people should attend a marriage or civil partnership, where this can be safely accommodated with social distancing in a COVID-19 secure venue. Further guidance can be found here.Large wedding receptions or parties should not currently be taking place and any celebration after the ceremony should follow the broader social distancing guidance of involving no more than two households in any location or, if outdoors, up to six people from different households.Can I travel outside of the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes.Can I travel into the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes. Weddings should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a wedding, but should not go into a private home or garden.Can I still visit a place of worship in the lockdown area?Yes, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (e.g. face coverings). We recommend at this time that if possible prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can funerals still take place in the lockdown areas?Yes. Funerals should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a funeral.Can I holiday in the lockdown area, or visit shops, leisure facilities, or cafes in it?Yes. However, you must avoid socialising with people indoors when doing so.Can I travel in a car with someone I do not live with?You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble. If you need to, try to:share the transport with the same people each timekeep to small groups of people at any one timeopen windows for ventilationtravel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow face away from each otherconsider seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicleclean your car between journeys using standard cleaning products – make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touchask the driver and passengers to wear a face coveringWhen will the lockdown be reviewed?Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the measures would be reviewed on a weekly basis. Muslim families urged to celebrate Eid at home amid fears of coronavirus spikeNorth West of England: local restrictions - what you can and cannot do - GOV.UK"},{"url":null,"title":"Local lockdowns Coronavirus cases soaring Shropshire Swindon official figures show","story":"Share this article Leicester still has the third highest infection rate in the country despite being forced to retreat back into lockdown in June, with 55.7 people per capita getting infected a week.Bradford, in West Yorkshire, (45.8 per 100,000) and Trafford, Greater Manchester, (39.3) round out the top five for worst infection rates.It comes as the Prime Minister today announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing lockdown at a Downing Street press conference.Mr Johnson warned that Covid-19 cases have started to \u0027creep up\u0027 and as a result the Government has no choice but to delay planned further casings. The PM had planned to reopen casinos, bowling alleys and allow crowds at live sporting events by August 1. But that has been pushed back to August 15 \u0027at the earliest\u0027 amid an uptick in infections across the country.Mr Johnson also revealed that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will be extended to include galleries, cinemas and places of worship.Me Johnson said: \u0027With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.\u0027On Saturday August 1 we had hoped to reopen in England a number of the higher risk settings that remained closed. Today I am afraid we are postponing those changes for at least a fortnight.\u0027That means until August 15 at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close contact services must remain closed, indoor performances will not resume, pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted but ceremonies of course can continue to take place in line with Covid secure guidelines\u0027.He added: \u0027I know that he steps we are taking will be a real blow to many people, to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted or cannot now celebrate Eid in the way that they would wish and I am really, really sorry about that but we simply cannot take the risk.\u0027Mr Johnson said the the new rules on face coverings will apply from August 8, with the police being tasked with increasing enforcement in order to ensure members of the public comply.He said: \u0027We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.\u0027We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings and this will become enforceable in law from August 8.\u0027 The announcement came as it was revealed Covid-19 cases have risen to a seven-week high in England and the R rate could now be above the dreaded level of one in both the North West and South West amid growing fears of a second wave.Government statisticians today admitted there is \u0027now enough evidence\u0027 to prove Covid-19 infections are on the up, estimating that 4,200 people are now catching the virus each day in England alone.The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which tracks the size of the outbreak by swabbing thousands of people, said the number of new daily cases was just 1,700 a fortnight ago.One in 1,500 people currently have the coronavirus - 0.07 per cent of the population. The figure does not include care homes and hospitals.Boris Johnson today said they \u0027can\u0027t ignore this evidence\u0027 as he announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing the coronavirus lockdown. Number 10\u0027s scientific advisers today also upped the R rate in the UK, saying they now believe it stands between 0.8 and 0.9. It had been as low as 0.7 since May.SAGE also revealed the growth rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - may have jumped to above one in the South West, home to the stay-cation hotspots of Devon, Cornwall and Dorset.And they said it was likely to be equally high in the North West.

Around the edges of the image is a border created out of the transport and NHS symbols, the professions of those who have been the worst affected.The portraits are of (from left): Andrew Ekene Nwankwo, a nurse, Donna Campbell, a healthcare support worker, Belly Mujinga, a rail worker, Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, a nurse, Ranjeet Riyat, a consultant in emergency medicine, Khulisani (Khuli) Nkala, a mental health nurse, Meks Nyack Ihenacho, a London bus driver.Written in the background are all the names and occupations of people who have died. I have left room to imply that there are more names to come.On a number of levels, I was very keen to support Patrick Vernon’s fund. From a personal perspective, as a family we have a huge debt of gratitude to the NHS. The Homerton ICU in London saved my daughter’s life. Before Christmas, we spent five weeks in intensive care with my daughter, who was on a ventilator with pneumonia. The ICU staff at the Homerton became like family to us, and when Covid-19 hit we felt intensely worried and upset for them, especially knowing how many fantastic BAME members of staff there were and how much more they were at risk.I have been appalled by the government’s handling of the crisis and the unnecessary deaths caused by lack of PPE, planning and the late lockdown and, ultimately, the systemic racism that has caused so many unnecessary deaths.

Rita was 17 when the photojournalist Lizzie Sadin photographed her. A year before, she was living with her family near the foothills of the Himalayas. A friend told her of a life of opportunity lying in wait in India, just a few hundred miles away. After crossing the border from Nepal, Rita was captured, imprisoned and forced into a life of sex work for visiting tourists. Rita’s eyes blaze into the airy calm of Porquerolles island.In 2017, Sadin, a former social worker in Paris’s périphérique, was the Carmignac photojournalism awards’ eighth winning laureate. On the basis of a two-page pitch, she received a €50,000 (£45,000) grant. She used the money to embed herself, with her camera hidden beneath her coat, in the shady dance bars of the Nepalese borderlands, capturing stories of modern-day slavery.Sadin is one of 10 photojournalists to receive such backing over the course of the last decade. To mark this milestone, Fondation Carmignac is exhibiting each laureate’s work in a retrospective titled 10 Years of Reportage, on show until 1 November 2020.With Rita’s eyes at its centre, the show is curated to urgently explore some of the biggest existential questions we face – the hidden truths of modern slavery, the cost of endless conflict, the consequences of habitat loss and the quest of freedom for those living under authoritarianism.“I came to Libya to document the humanitarian crisis of migrants trying to reach Europe through Libyan territory,” says Narciso Contreras. “But, actually, what I found is a market.”From February to June 2016, the Mexican photographer travelled through Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.He captured how Libya has become a human marketplace in which destitute migrants are bought and sold as they attempt to make their way to Europe.Contreras uses the exhibition to show the first images – taken on his iPhone – of a transaction taking place between traffickers, which helped NGO groups affiliated with Carmignac prove modern slavery was taking place in Libya.Contreras concluded that, far from trying to resolve the situation, “Libyan authorities were running, and profiting from”, the trafficking of people.Arctic: New Frontier – Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, 2018If you’re planning to visit the north pole, it might be a good idea to get a move on. On the basis of all authoritative forecasts, the ice of the Arctic will be gone by 2030, to be replaced by a water world created by anthropogenic global warming.Never before have two photojournalists simultaneously covered the irreversible changes that are taking place in the Arctic. That is until Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, working in coordination, created Arctic: New Frontier in 2018.Kozyrev followed the routes of the Russian Arctic ports, from the city of Murmansk to the Taymyr peninsula and the islands of the Russian Arctic. Van Lohuizen, meanwhile, started in the Svalbard Archipelago and followed the northern Arctic route through Greenland, Canada and the northern tip of Alaska. Each captured the expansion of the region’s ports, industrial forces and military sites – “a process that will change the map of the world forever”, Kozyrev says.The New Zealand-born photographer Robin Hammond calls Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe “a garden of Eden that became a hell to many of its inhabitants”. In the processing of taking portraits of Zimbabwe’s pro-democracy activists, Hammond was imprisoned twice. “They wanted to show me the terrible living conditions they have to endure,” he says. “But some were afraid for me, and warned me of the danger.”His portraits include the face of the activist Masvingo, staring out from a pool of darkness. Hammond hides his body, severely burnt after soldiers threw a can of lit petrol into a campaign office for Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change.Iran: Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album – Newsha Tavakolian, 2014In 2015, Tavakolian became the first female photographer from the Middle East to join Magnum, the photography collective. The year before, she was the Carmignac laureate for a body of work that explored, via moving and still image, the personal stories of her own generation – the Iranian millennials who have grown up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution and the country’s bloody war with Iraq.As a self-taught photographer, and when still a teenager, she took to the streets to photograph the 1999 student uprising in Iran, “spending a week scaling trees with a zoom lens” while militia marched through the streets.Her series here captures nine men and women, shot in and around Tehran, as they communicate the tension of “being marginalised by those speaking in their name”, Tavakolian says. In Iran, “they try to fit into a landscape they regard as not being their own. They, like many of the others they represent, adapt.”Seen together, the Carmignac Foundation’s retrospective is a stark reminder, in the midst of the bucolic beauty of the French Riviera, of the first world’s increasing responsibility to the poverty, oppression and vulnerability that is the daily reality for most people in this world.Carmignac Photojournalism Award: 10 Years of Reportage is on show until 1 November 2020 at Villa Carmignac, Porquerolles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a609aea440a248512a7b5309886c72674b2a1e/2_0_5902_3543/master/5902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a128a16e4689d3ad7d51e7b7723f4041","title":"being inbetween girls of our time in pictures","story":"A series documenting and exploring the lives of girls aged between 10 and 12 a time of transition between girlhood and young adulthood.

After a closure of four months, the Dickens Museum reopened on 25 July for three days a week.“It felt a long time for a historic house,” said Sughrue, “particularly a house that is based around a personality, that had been a family home. The thing that brings this place to life is having people in it.”A National Lottery grant has kept things afloat, along with a JustGiving appeal that has raised more than £40,000. Like other museums, Sughrue is studying the details of the newly announced Culture Recovery Fund from the government. “We’re not out of danger yet,” she said.Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford-on-Avon will reopen on 1 August, while at Jane Austen’s House in Chawton, Hampshire, director Lizzie Dunford reopens on 8 August. The cottage where Austen revised, wrote and had published all six of her novels will be offering a far more intimate experience to visitors than before: numbers will be significantly limited, with visitors given time slots.“We’re only issuing 12 tickets an hour so people are really able to explore the house and experience it in quite an intimate way,” said Dunfored. “We know it’s going to be a strange experience, it’ll be different, there’ll be hand sanitiser everywhere and strict social distancing, but we want to make it feel like people are entering a home”When the pandemic struck, the museum warned its future was at stake and launched an appeal. That fundraiser has now made over £95,000, way past its £75,000 target, and the museum has also received emergency funding from the National Lottery.“We were extraordinarily lucky to have this fantastic appeal and support,” said Dunford. “It gave us that real sense of hope when there was no money coming in and we didn’t know if we would be able to reopen. To have the comments of people saying ‘this matters’, that was so important for staff and custodians of this incredibly special place when it really looked so dark.”At the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, staff are hoping to reopen at the end of August, with a timed entry scheme for visitors. They have in addition been running The Brontë Lounge, a strand of live talks on Zoom with authors including Tracy Chevalier in the meantime. Emergency support from ACE has also helped, and means the museum can survive until September, but a public appeal for funds has so far raised just £5,000 of the £100,000.“Our strength is that we have a really beautiful domestic setting, but that is also a weakness when it comes to social distancing and footfall,” said the museum’s Rebecca Yorke. “Visitors will have a really special experience because they’ll have space and time to themselves, but going forward we’ll have to see how viable that can be.”“There is so much love for the museum and the Brontës, it is unthinkable that in 12 months’ time we might not be here. It’s really hard to say that out loud but it’s the uncertainty, it is not knowing how long measures will be in place, how quickly footfall will resume.”According to the director of Wordsworth Grasmere, Michael McGregor, the pandemic hit at the worst time, with the museum at Dove Cottage gearing up for a grand reopening in April to mark the 250th anniversary of the poet’s birth. “We were desperate to get open and start generating income,” McGregor said.After ACE support, the cottage is set to reopen on 15 August, with safety measures in place including a one-way flow for visitors. “A lot of it is getting the message out not just that you’re open, but that you’re safe to visit,” McGregor added.And after a redesign, staff are desperate to show the cottage off. “You cross the threshold and feel like you’re actually intruding on somebody else’s house – almost as if William and Dorothy had just walked out the door,” he said. “What we’ve tried to do is move away from that sense of the cottage as a museum of Wordsworth, to convey that sense of a lived-in house, and how in this bustling, noisy, quite messy house, with three children running around, somehow great poetry was written.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4de526f28c386af673f7e491478bcd9e5f75833/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=856cde1f1d5b63093ad8e79392b7a89a","title":"has amazon fresh chosen the prime moment to take on uk supermarkets","story":"Despite the surge in online grocery shopping Amazon still faces an uphill struggle for market share. It may be easier to just buy a supermarketSupermarkets have been waiting several years for Amazon to make its next move in the UK’s near-£200bn food retail market and it came this week when the American company revealed plans to expand its online grocery service Amazon Fresh.Amazon has already won over millions of Britons with the rapid-fire delivery of books, toys and household essentials to their front door, and coronavirus lockdowns have made it a lifeline for some households.Fresh has operated with little fanfare in London and the home counties for several years but the online retailer has promised wider availability by the end of 2020, including in major cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh.To win over shoppers, Amazon is offering the service as a new perk to the estimated 15 million Britons that are paid up members of its Prime membership scheme, which offers extras such as faster delivery and streaming services for a £79 annual fee.“Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon,” said Russell Jones, country manager, Amazon Fresh UK. “We will keep improving the grocery shopping experience so by the end of the year, millions of Prime members across the UK will have access to fast, free delivery of groceries.”The move is timed to capitalise on new shopping habits forged during the pandemic when many households opted to buy their groceries online for the first time. Ocado recently revealed it had a waiting list of 1 million customers after its automated warehouses struggled to cope with the huge surge in demand.Amazon brought the Fresh service over from the US in 2016 and the following year caused a storm when it spent more than £10bn on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. But instead of going it alone here Amazon has put together its food range through partnerships with homegrown chains including Morrisons and upmarket regional chain Booths.Relationships with the manufacturers of major grocery brands such as Pepsi, Cadbury and Heinz means the Fresh service carries “tens of thousands of products” – a selection comprehensive enough for a weekly shop.“Amazon is going to have to work incredibly hard to dislodge people’s loyalty to their existing supermarket,” says Bryan Roberts, an independent retail analyst. “Depending where you live people are either Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda or Morrisons shoppers and when they go online are more likely to buy from those retailers because they’re familiar with the range and the pricing and the private label.”He adds: “One of the big things everyone is ignoring is that grocery home delivery is brilliant at the moment but that’s because everyone is at home. Fast forward 12 to 18 months, that isn’t always going to be the case.”Amazon has 14 depots capable of handling groceries around the country and says it has expanded its fulfilment network in key locations to handle the expected customer demand. But analysts think it does not have adequate infrastructure to offer a competitive grocery delivery service nationwide. Yet.Last year, the proposed merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda was blocked by the competition watchdog, which argued that the proposed £7bn deal threatened to push up prices and reduce the choice and quality of products on sale in stores. There has been no deal action since then. Analysts think if Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, wants to make waves here it will have to buy an incumbent, with Walmart-owned Asda or Morrisons the most likely targets.“Amazon is probably going to be the next key player in any consolidation in the industry, particularly if, as it as it decided in the USA, that the only real way to move to the right in groceries is to buy a store estate,” says Clive Black, an analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital.“Asda is for sale and the big American private equity firms are looking at it, so we can’t rule that out even though Walmart and Amazon are going head to head in the states at the moment. They also have a formal relationship with Morrisons.”Ocado ZoomOnly available to a limited number of postcodes from a small site in west London (second planned for north London).

However, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, must come clean and acknowledge that our railways are now in public ownership and take direct control of running them rather than continue to line the pockets of fleecing privateers with taxpayers’ money.”While the emergency measures are temporary, they come at a crucial juncture for the future of England’s complex rail franchising system.The government commissioned a review of the future of railways, following a string of failures of franchises that ended up being effectively nationalised, including the Northern network earlier this year.The former British Airways boss Keith Williams, who is leading the ongoing review, said last year that the government should take a “step back” from the UK railway, which could potentially be run by a new body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3f5728bd5ac96268397b6b29a651ee29dd3733/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc9c6eaf7ed65bb4fcc394a79c684df3","title":"owner of uk chip firm arm reported in talks about sale to nvidia","story":"Japan’s SoftBank could offload semiconductor maker within weeks for at least $32bnThe UK-based microchip designer Arm is the subject of “advanced talks” aimed at selling the British tech company to a US computing giant.The computing firm Nvidia is negotiating with Arm’s Japanese owner, SoftBank, to acquire the Cambridge-based group in a deal that could be agreed within weeks, according to a report by Bloomberg.The news came two weeks after the Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank was exploring a sale of Arm.A deal to acquire Arm could be the largest ever in the semiconductor industry, which has been consolidating in recent years as companies seek to ersify and expand. Arm’s technology underpins chips in products including Apple devices.Arm was sold to SoftBank in 2016 for $32bn (£24bn) and any transaction would value the business at a further premium, the Financial Times reported.The news will be viewed as a step by SoftBank to improve its finances, just months after the Japanese conglomerate posted its biggest loss ever.In May, SoftBank reported a $12.7bn annual loss, after announcing a $19.6bn profit the year before.The results were largely caused by the large bets SoftBank had made on a series of tech-related companies, that had once been considered stars of the startup world, only to have since struggled.

But it doesn’t have to be this wayThis week, in a hearing on Capitol Hill, you could gaze upon the men with the power to determine November’s presidential election and the future of American democracy – but the men in question were not politicians. Rather they were the four tech titans who appeared by Zoom before a congressional committee. Even via video link, the power radiated from them: the heads of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple loomed from the monitors as veritable masters of the universe, their elected questioners mere earthlings.That hardly exaggerates their might. Between them, and with their users numbered in the billions, Facebook and Google determine much of what the human race sees, reads and knows. Mark Zuckerberg’s writ runs across the planet, no single government is able to constrain him: he is an emperor of knowledge, a minister of information for the entire world. A mere tweak of an algorithm by Facebook can decide whether lies, hate and conspiracy theories spread or shrivel.That’s been true for a while, but in 2020 it’s gained an extra urgency. We know the impact social media had in the US election in 2016 – when ever wilder fictions and fantasies were allowed to proliferate about Hillary Clinton and when, according to the Oxford scholar Philip Howard in a new book, Lie Machines: “There was a one-to-one ratio of junk news to professional news shared by voters over Twitter.” In fewer than 100 days Americans will choose a president, and there are no guarantees that the same thing will not happen again.What’s more, it’s now clear that the online spread of falsehoods is a matter of life and death. (They knew that already in Myanmar, where the violence against the Rohingya people was incited on Facebook.) In the midst of a pandemic, solid, verified information is an essential tool of public health. If bogus claims and unhinged conspiracy theories – like those aired in a pseudo-documentary such as Plandemic – land in people’s news feeds, it’s as if the water supply has become contaminated. Eventually Facebook and YouTube took down Plandemic, with its evidence-free assertions that Covid-19 is the fault of Bill Gates and the World Health Organization, that vaccines are bad and that wearing a mask is dangerous, but not before millions had ingested that garbage on those platforms.Of course, cranks and fantasists have been with us forever, but social media has given them a reach they could never have dreamed of. Armed with Facebook, the would-be propagandist can distribute messages globally and instantly and, at the same time, deliver them to a precisely selected audience, thanks to the copious data Facebook holds on its users, the use of which allows ads to be micro-targeted for a price. And remember, this data isn’t limited to the attitudes you might have expressed online, but could include the purchases you’ve made on your credit card, even the mundane details of your life, as recorded by the gadgets that comprise the internet of things.Occasionally the social media behemoths are compelled to take at least the appearance of action, if only for the sake of managing their own reputations. It happened this week, with the eventual removal of grime artist Wiley from multiple platforms after he went on an extended, hate-filled rant against Jews: after a 48-hour “walkout” from Twitter, organised by an ad-hoc group of activists and celebrities, the network appeared to realise hosting high-profile racism isn’t a good look. Today, Twitter removed the account of white supremacist David Duke, which prompts the question: what on earth took you so long?Make no mistake, the presence of lies and hate on these platforms is not some regrettable bug. It is a feature. The business model for social media requires attention – eyeballs – and the best way to get that is engagement. Messages that stir anger, fury and yes, hate, keep people online more effectively than content that is merely interesting or amusing. It’s why studies show that false news spreads faster than true news: the algorithms are designed to favour virality over veracity.What can be done? There’s no shortage of ideas. Some start with the demand for fact-checking and, after the 2016 election, Facebook took steps in that direction. But when it emerged that one of its fact-checking partners was  Daily Caller, a rightwing news website known for pushing misinformation, the scheme’s credibility plunged.Or, more simply, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter could admit that of course they are publishers and they should therefore take the responsibility that goes with the mighty power they have. If that means hiring a million moderators to check their content, weeding out lies and hate, then so be it. They can hardly cry poverty: these are close to trillion-dollar companies.If they don’t like the analogy with publishers, then perhaps they’d rather be treated like, say, car manufacturers, who, if found to be delivering a dangerously faulty product, have to recall and fix that product, regardless of the expense. At the moment, the social media giants enjoy legal protection from such liability in the US.Politicians could change that, just as they could follow Howard’s demands in Lie Machines and break the big companies’ “monopolisation of information” by legislating a citizens’ right to donate their own data to smaller organisations: that way such groups would be more able to compete with the tech giants and those able to pay for their services.But, as this week’s hearing proved, elected representatives are not powerful enough to do that alone. They’d have to work together, governments across the globe. They’d need the backing of advertisers, withdrawing their pounds and dollars from companies that give a platform to hate. And they’d need all of us to declare we’re sick of this poison in the information bloodstream, and we won’t rest till it’s drained away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc3d15cbb7855f6e7a8b0d643d6f8a03544f1ca4/0_0_2560_1836/master/2560.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32e8ee9c0022f5668af1c1fcac25d351 720w","title":"jeremy ngakia set to link up with watford after leaving west ham","story":"Jeremy Ngakia is close to joining Watford after leaving West Ham on a free transfer when his contract expired at the end of June.The 19-year-old right-back turned down West Ham’s offer of a new long-term deal and even rejected their attempts to persuade him to sign a short-term extension until the end of the season. He departed when David Moyes‘s side still had seven league games left and were battling to preserve their Premier League status.Ngakia did not see his future at West Ham despite being handed his debut by Moyes earlier this year. However the news that he is set to sign for Watford has raised a few eyebrows at the London Stadium.

Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1de80d6c88b6832010edf537da5c49bf9a1ad0f/0_183_5433_3259/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677e4bdfb22ec11f5cb79f5c4f0cc39a","title":"couples in england coronavirus are you planning on getting married at the start of august","story":"We would like to hear from those who have to change their plans due to coronavirus guidance from the governmentWith less than 24 hours notice, Boris Johnson has announced that the government is postponing the easing of lockdown measures which, from tomorrow, would have allowed couples getting married to have a reception with up to 30 people.  would like to hear from people getting married this weekend who were planning to have a reception but have now been told they are not allowed to.

This anticlimax had more to do with the one-sidedness of the contest rather than the emptiness of the stands. We hope for a better game when England and Ireland meet again at 2pm on Saturday in the second ODI.The opening match delivered some mundane fare but at least it was not the embarrassing massacre that was on the cards when Ireland were 28 for five after seven overs. After all the training, the England players especially revelled in the opportunity to play a proper match. “It was great to be back playing cricket‚” said Eoin Morgan, “which is what we’ve been doing since we were kids.”The Irish team did not seem so elated. Despite the absence of spectators they looked nervous, almost overawed by the occasion, but Curtis Campher, the 21-year-old all-rounder from South Africa who has yet to play a game in Ireland, was a shining exception.The captain, Andy Balbirnie, must consider whether to shuffle his pack. Barry McCarthy, the opening bowler, who limped off in his first over, is highly unlikely to be fit so Balbirnie must choose between the veteran Boyd Rankin and the highly promising youngster Josh Little.It is a familiar dilemma. In the first game the Irish took the bold course. They omitted their vastly experienced former captain William Porterfield and opted for another debutant, Harry Tector, who was out for a duck. They have a very tricky juggling act to perform they desperately need to blood new players and, of course, they crave immediate success, which is a tough proposition given they are playing against the World Cup winners – well, four or five of them.Selection on the England side is less complicated though Morgan has indicated he may be prepared to make a few changes throughout the series, especially among the bowlers. However plans can change swiftly. Sam Billings would not have played in the first match but for a back twinge experienced by Joe Denly, who was on Friday ruled out of the series and replaced in the squad by Liam Livingstone. But having produced the best innings of the match at an important time it would be perverse if Billings did not play again on Saturday.He hopes his experience batting down the order and his adroitness against spin make him a strong candidate for the next World Cup, which is scheduled to take place in India in 2023. There was a glimmer of that as he confidently reverse swept the Irish off-spinners at the Rose Bowl.“I offer good options against spin,” he said, citing his experience in franchise cricket, most notably in the IPL on turning pitches in Delhi and Chennai. “I now back my game in those conditions‚“ he added while recognising that England’s white ball teams “are arguably the hardest in the world to get into at the moment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d3c27140af5b1f7267d26a98d28fec5c611dcd/0_227_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f2bbadf800c79d2d195b4d79ce2dc93","title":"toto wolff lewis hamilton wont let criticism close to his soul","story":"The Mercedes principal on his respect and admiration for the British driver, who he says takes criticism on board, learns from his mistakes and can race beyond his 40sFor a man who leads the dominant force in modern Formula One, Toto Wolff makes scant concession to the trappings of success. Indeed, at home the Mercedes team principal, the architect of six consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championship doubles, hosts only two pieces of F1 memorabilia.Neither is chosen lightly, and while one reflects Mercedes’s iron grip on the sport, the other is more symbolic, more personal and instructive of the relationship he enjoys with the driver who has shared this journey to the top, Lewis Hamilton. Wolff’s respect for Hamilton is palpable, not least recently for his strong position on promoting racial equality and ersity. It has brought his driver criticism but the Austrian has only admiration for his stance.“Lewis has been for some time one of the leading, most recognised people within F1. There are not a lot of personalities even near that,” he says. “He is like a lightning rod, because he wears his heart on his sleeve and voices his opinion. We need exactly that, we need character, we need opinions.”Tellingly, Wolff, who sits at the very heart of Mercedes alongside Hamilton, believes this strength of character has made him the man and the driver he is.“If you express your opinion and you are a public persona you will always polarise,” he adds. “Lewis has been at the helm of this sport for more than 10 years. When you are out there and have been abused or criticised, you cope with it much better after a while. He takes the criticism on board and learns from it, but he is not letting it anywhere close to his soul.”Wolff has been the team principal at Mercedes since 2013, the same year Hamilton joined. In 2014 they secured their first title together and have not stopped since. At Wolff’s home the F1 constructors’ championship trophy is displayed with pride, his team’s name etched into history on its gleaming panels. This year, a seventh double would be a record in the sport. Wolff is emphatic in insisting what a team effort it has been.The only other item that imparts a suggestion of Wolff’s day job is the helmet Hamilton had designed to honour Niki Lauda and wore at the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix. Lauda had been instrumental in bringing Hamilton to Mercedes and as non-executive chairman became one of Wolff’s closest friends. The three-times world champion died at the start of the week leading up to Monaco. It was an emotional weekend and Hamilton delivered what Lauda would have wanted for the team – a win.Wolff clearly treasures his memories of Lauda that are, as the helmet symbolises, inextricably linked to his relationship with Hamilton. The driver and his principal share a clear emotional and personal bond. Wolff is perhaps the man best placed in F1 to offer assessment of why Hamilton is so successful on the track and so compelling a character off it.“Lewis has become a friend, a partner, somebody I trust and vice versa,” he says. He believes the key moment came in 2016 after an acrimonious season won by Hamilton’s then Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, after which Wolff and Hamilton had to sit down and clear the air. It worked and what had been a professional relationship became personal.“Since then we have had a brutal honesty and transparency with each other,” says Wolff. “There is nothing that is hidden, there is no agenda that is not known.” Hamilton is so close to Wolff that he has remarked his decision on whether to stay with the team could be influenced by whether Wolff remains.“It’s been a relationship that has its own complexities but has grown so much,” Hamilton said at Silverstone. “It is just going from strength to strength. I think in relationships, in friendships, as you get to know about each other your barriers start to come down a little bit and you open up more to each other.”Wolff in turn recognises that Hamilton has surpassed being merely the man behind the wheel. “Lewis has two really outstanding characteristics,” he says. “The talent that he has and the way he has developed that talent and himself in the car and outside the car. That makes him this great champion.”With five of his six titles for Mercedes, Hamilton goes into this weekend’s British Grand Prix looking formidably strong in his attempt to make it seven and match Michael Schumacher’s record. He has two wins from three races this season and loves the circuit. The determination to deliver at home will be as fierce as ever.Yet this success has not come by accident. Although Hamilton’s natural talent has served him well, F1 is littered with exceptionally gifted drivers who could not translate their touch into triumph. Wolff has closely observed Hamilton’s ability to relentlessly build on his strengths.“One of the things that inspires me the most is his ability for personal growth,” he says. “The racing driver that adapts to every new car, adapts his driving style, is a skill that not many have. He has the same ability around his persona. He develops, he analyses his weakness and strengths. Always with the focus of improving himself.”That Hamilton has developed as a driver is clear, but he has become a leader. He has been uncompromising and resolutely determined in speaking out against racism after the death of George Floyd and Wolff was entirely unsurprised he did so.“If you are a child eight years old being racially abused on a go-kart track, imagine the scars that leaves,” he says. “We as middle-aged white men can never put ourselves in a situation of someone who has been racially abused. So I was always very open to his opinion and judgment. I think he realised that a peaceful, silent protest hasn’t changed anything in the last 60 years. So maybe it’s time to utilise your voice in a more polarising and confrontational way with the hope that he can trigger change. I am, with all my heart, and everybody in the team are on board with the fight against racism.”Hamilton may indeed polarise but at Silverstone he has always been received rapturously. With six victories at the British GP, he is the most successful driver at the race a seventh is well within his grasp. There will be no celebratory communion afterwards with the fans but they may enjoy the ride with him for some time yet.“He is 35 now, the way he adapts I think he can race beyond his 40s,” says Wolff. “He can push the boundaries in the way Tom Brady did in American football. Who would have thought that a quarterback could win a Super Bowl beyond the age of 40? Tom Brady has shown everybody that it is possible. Maybe Lewis will do the same in F1.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c16acc9f9bb7fe7b4d5ba188e1be8afa0418e53b/0_13_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83edd0a3e54bb62a3a3f1c94ada97d3","title":"scary situation delay to lockdown easing forces costly theatre cancellations","story":"The union Equity said that the PM’s last-minute announcement was ‘distressing news’ as venues in England face financial hitThe government’s last-minute delay to lockdown easing has left theatres in England scrambling to cancel performances for this weekend.Great Yarmouth’s Hippodrome Circus had been due to open its circus summer season on Saturday. Jack Jay, the ringmaster and producer, said that they heard the news 20 minutes before starting their dress rehearsal.The Hippodrome, which intends to keep the cast in town, will now take a significant financial hit at the box office. The theatre stages its circus spectacular 13 times a week, so at least 26 performances will be affected by the delay, which is set to be a fortnight or longer. Jay hopes customers will be willing to rearrange their bookings for a future date but as many of their audiences are tourists he fears that there will be a number who can’t rebook. The decision to postpone lockdown easing could also affect customer confidence over the summer, Jay warned.The venue’s usual capacity of around 850 has been reduced to approximately 300 with social distancing measures, so the profit margin is already slimmer. “The window for us to recoup costs from our show is closing,” Jay added. The Hippodrome Circus summer season ends on 20 September, to coincide with the end of the tourist season and school holidays. The summer show usually opens in mid-July. When the announcement was made two weeks ago that indoor performances could reopen with social distancing from 1 August, as the fourth stage in the government’s five-step plan for reopening arts venues, Jay and his team acted swiftly and “basically put a whole new show together”.A cast of around 20, including dancers, aerialists, swimmers and acrobats, was brought to Yarmouth from around the UK. Jay said that while the delay was disappointing and difficult to deal with, the government was showing a dynamic approach in reacting to the pandemic. “If they went the other way and said there could be nothing until 2021 then that would be worse.” At least there was now another date, 15 August, to work towards he said, while admitting: “It does put us in a scary situation – that you can have a few hours’ notice for such a big delay. It’s a scary time to be a producer.”The Kenneth More theatre in Ilford, east London, had planned to reopen at under half its usual capacity on Saturday night with a socially distanced concert featuring performers from the local Redbridge Drama Centre. Sally Polden, who organised the event, said the theatre “is not only part of our local cultural offer but a lifeline for many involved”. She added: “We will not be defeated – as soon as we can reopen for live performance, our theatre is ready. We’ve contacted all customers and performers today who have been very empathetic, and are as sad as we are, but equally are ready to return and have the confidence that we can do this safely when permitted.”London’s Phoenix Arts Club tweeted that being told to cancel its early August cabaret nights at such short notice “is not on” and that the government should “give proper notice” to venues. The union Bectu’s national secretary, Noel McClean, said: “What this announcement demonstrates is that theatre employers should be exempt from making contributions to the furlough scheme and that a specific fund must be set-up to support theatre freelancers. The arts recovery funding is still months away and clearly there are significant hurdles on the road to theatres reopening again.”The union Equity said that Boris Johnson’s “11th-hour announcement” was “distressing news for members working in variety and indoor performance who were hoping to start earning again tomorrow”. Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust, said most theatres will not be able to put on productions until we reach stage five of culture secretary Oliver Dowden’s “roadmap” for reopening venues, which allows fuller audiences for indoor performances. “That is the most critical date for much of the sector,” he said.Pilot schemes for inside performances are now also suspended for the first two weeks of August but outdoor productions with socially distanced audiences can still go ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

One can never guarantee the safety or effectiveness unless you do the trial, but we are cautiously optimistic this will be successful,” Fauci said in prepared remarks.He later added: “I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they’re administering the vaccine to anyone. I do not believe that there will be vaccines so far ahead of us that we will have to depend on other countries to get us vaccines.”Fauci’s appearance came at the end of a month when coronavirus deaths in America rose by close to 25,000 and new cases doubled in at least 18 states. The US recorded close to 1.8m new Covid-19 cases in July, and this week the total number of deaths rose over 152,000.The Trump administration has invested in several vaccine candidates through an initiative named Operation Warp Speed. On Monday it was announced that one potential vaccine, developed by the biotechnology company Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would enter phase three of testing in trials conducted at almost 100 research centers in the US and involving about 30,000 volunteers.After updating the committee on the status of a potential vaccine, Fauci was aggressively questioned by the Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, a close ally of Trump, who sought to tie the hearing to the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests around the country.Jordan asked Fauci whether the US government should seek to limit protests in order to curb the spread of the virus.“You make all kinds of recommendations, you’ve made comments on dating and baseball and everything you can imagine … I’m just asking should we limit the protests,” Jordan said.“I think I would leave that to people who have more of a position to do that,” Fauci replied. He later added: “I’m not going to opine on limiting anything. I’m telling what it is the danger. And you can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds, no matter where the crowds are.”From the outset, Democrats also sought to frame the hearing as an indictment of the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. The subcommittee chair, Jim Clyburn, a close confidant of the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, argued: “The federal government has still not yet developed and implemented a national strategy to protect the American people.”Clyburn then quizzed Fauci, pointing to a board in the committee room showing the US rate of infection recently soaring in comparison with rates in Europe.Fauci responded directly: “If you look at what happened in Europe, when they shut down, they really did it, to the tune of about 95-plus per cent.Responding to that exchange on Twitter, Trump posted a factually inaccurate diatribe. “Somebody please tell Congressman Clyburn, who doesn’t have a clue, that the chart he put up indicating more CASES for the U.S. than Europe, is because we do MUCH MORE testing than any other country in the World. If we had no testing, or bad testing, we would show very few CASES.” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ea3920153c4b9708c8afeb44d645a1f9ccbbb3/0_261_5163_3098/master/5163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=882ef159e9a252987c5311c2a180b544","title":"how the covid 19 resurgence is dividing opinion across europe","story":"Message echoes across continent that pleasures of communal life may soon be sacrificed againThe advice from Spain’s health ministry this week was simple.Using the hashtag #Don’tChuckitallAway, the ministry told people not to kiss or hug friends and family, not to share plates, to keep a careful eye on who’s been drinking from which glass, to slip the mask back on straight after eating and to keep washing hands frequently.Behind the entreaties lies a blunt and unwelcome message that has since echoed across Europe: the small, quotidian pleasures of communal life – pleasures willingly and gainfully sacrificed during the springtime lockdowns – may soon have to be foregone once again.Whether described as a second wave, a continuation of the first or merely a rash of local outbreaks, the number of people found to be infected with Covid-19 in recent days across the continent has climbed to the highest levels in months.Coronavirus clusters have sprung up in Spain, Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg, among others. This has often left politicians split on how to respond at a time when their voters are crying out for a holiday and their economies are desperate for the return of tourists.Last week, the deputy head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies noted the incidence of the virus had tripled in a little over a fortnight and that “it could already be a second wave”.“That’s why, in my opinion, we can’t talk about a second wave of cases,” Illa said this week.For all the definitional squabbling, which has been heard all around Europe as the infection rates ticked up, such assurances have not been sufficient for the British government – or indeed others.A de facto UK ban on travel to Spain, announced on Saturday and widened on Monday to include the Canaries and the Balearics, will rob the Spanish tourist sector of many of the millions of Britons who make up a fifth of all visitors.The UK government has followed up with a similar warnings against travel to Luxembourg from where travellers will be obliged to go into quarantine for 14 days.German authorities added Catalonia and two other northern Spanish regions to a long list of risk areas on Friday. Belgium has been put on a list of unsafe countries by the governments in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Norway.The Netherlands, meanwhile, has warned its residents to avoid the Flemish city of Antwerp, just across the Belgian-Dutch border. “Don’t stop to rest or fill up with fuel,” the alarming official government advice warns.It is isive, dismaying for those looking for a break and likely to be the start of a further carving up of Europe between those deemed tolerably safe or not.But for all that, it may be different this time, virologists and politicians believe. While in March when the shutters were forced down across Europe, there was insufficient knowledge about the virus or how it spreaded but governments and their scientific advisers are more clued up now.By Thursday, there were 412 active outbreaks in Spain but it was clear many of them were linked to bars, nightclubs and seasonal fruit and vegetable pickers, whose often terrible living and working conditions makes physical distancing impossible.Governments and local authorities have sought to hone in on the problem areas. The Catalan government, which has already ordered the shuttering of the region’s nightclubs for a fortnight, asked young people to behave responsibly and threatened fines of up to €15,000 (£13,504) for people who engage in botellones, or large street parties.In Belgium, Antwerp’s doubling of infections in a week has also been partly put down to the city’s lively student nightlife. An 11.30pm to 6am curfew, the first in the city since the second world war, has been enforced.Some confidence is also being taken from the fact that it is younger people who are now being infected. “That should result in fewer patients in intensive care and less fatalities, and it should ease the pressure on hospitals a bit,” said Steven Callens, an expert on infectious diseases at Ghent University Hospital in Belgium.Virologist Marc Van Ranst, who sits on Belgium’s national security council said: “We now know the virus better, and we test better. The difference between the number of positive tests and the number of hospital admissions is now much larger.”In Germany, the number of daily cases has fluctuated between 600 and 900 – a far cry from the 6,500 being seen every day in March but sufficient to cause some alarm.But, again, the experience of the past few months could still count for a lot, said Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the University of Hamburg.“GPs know what they have to do in case of suspected cases, ICUs are well prepared, the lab capacities for testing are good, at around 1.2m a week”, he told Der Spiegel. What’s more, added Schmidt-Chanasit, the general public is better informed about the virus than it was at the start.In France, the prime minister, Jean Castex, has said shutting the country down again after the stringent, two-month lockdown between March and May, would be “catastrophic”.Officials said any new lockdowns would most likely be localised on where there are outbreaks. Or, as Castex put it: “We will adapt.”Some young people feel they are being unfairly singled out by the authorities.“I think blaming young people is the easiest option for the government when it comes to finding new scapegoats for the problems of controlling Covid-19,” said Martí Pont, a recent biology graduate from Barcelona. “But the truth is we’re all trying to deal with ‘the new normality’ that none of us is prepared for.”Adarra Solas, a 21-year-old dancer also from Barcelona, agreed the post-lockdown scenes witnessed so far were nothing if not predictable.“I think they’re putting the blame on us to dodge responsibility,” she said. “It was obvious that young people would go out, drink and have fun after the months we’ve been through. But when I look around, I see both young and older people walking about without masks, not wearing them on public transport, or not following the safety guidelines.”“The summer’s come and we’ve all started to relax,” Solas added. But if the governments of Europe are warning of anything, it is the danger of that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca133af0bbcebe12355188fd66a64d5a386e4293/0_6_3319_1991/master/3319.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9897cccbec02001998220630230ead4d","title":"us sanctions china xinjiang uighurs","story":"The United States has imposed sanctions on a major economic and paramilitary organization with vast interests in China’s north-western region of Xinjiang, accusing it of facilitating widespread abuses against Uighur Muslims.The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has been seen as a state within a state, running its own towns, universities and media geared overwhelmingly toward China’s Han ethnic majority.The treasury department said it will freeze any US assets held by the group, known locally as the Bingtuan, and prohibit transactions with it.Calling China’s actions toward minorities “the stain of the century”, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that the Bingtuan was “directly involved” in mass incarceration of Uighurs and other mostly Muslim communities in Xinjiang.“We call on all countries to join us in condemning the CCP’s heinous abuse of the human rights of its own citizens, affecting countless families across the world,” said Pompeo, referring to the Chinese Communist party.The treasury department also imposed sanctions on Peng Jiarui, the commander of the corps, and Sun Jinlong, a former Bingtuan official.Founded in the 1950s on orders of communist China’s founder, Mao Zedong, the Bingtuan settled demobilized soldiers on work farms in Xinjiang.It gradually came to run a vast amount of agricultural land as well as businesses in areas such as real estate, insurance, plastics and cement, with Beijing tasking the Bingtuan to build infrastructure and new cities seen as accommodating Han settlers.Human rights groups say that China has in recent years stepped up the migration of ethnic Han to the region and has tried to forcibly homogenize Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, including banning many Islamic practices.Activists say that about 1 million Uighurs and other Turkic people have been incarcerated in brainwashing camps, a mass detention that US officials have said has parallels to the Holocaust.China describes the camps as vocational training centers and says it is seeking to provide education to reduce the allure of Islamic radicalism.The United States earlier in July froze the visas and any US assets of three officials over rights in Xinjiang including Chen Quanguo, the Communist party chief in the region.China accused the US of interference in its internal affairs and said it would similarly ban Americans “who behave badly on Xinjiang-related issues”.The treasury department said it took action against the Bingtuan in part over links to Chen, an architect of Beijing’s iron-fisted policies toward minorities who previously served in Tibet.Pompeo, speaking on Thursday before the Senate foreign relations committee, said the United States was seeking to persuade other nations to join Washington in taking action. “I’ve been disappointed to see Muslim countries not respond,” Pompeo said. “We’re urging them to take this on in a serious way.”US lawmakers have pushed for tough action and are considering a ban on almost all imports from Xinjiang, saying that products from the region – a major source of the world’s yarn – are inextricably linked to forced labor.Despite the public statements, the former US national security adviser John Bolton wrote in an explosive memoir that Donald Trump voiced understanding for the mass detentions.Bolton wrote that China’s President Xi Jinping explained his policies in a meeting, to which Trump replied that the camps were “exactly the right thing to do”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdfd3f9f3b965a8aafc02b215267d384115ab0f1/0_369_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=749ed6e948b71063a8fe96ebef48e0e8","title":"coronavirus

experimental Covid-19 vaccine.The doses would be manufactured in European countries including France, Belgium, Germany and Italy.Sanofi is leading the clinical development of the vaccine and expects to launch a pivotal trial by the end of this year.Florida reported another record increase in Covid-19 deaths on Friday.The state health department said Florida registered 257 fatalities, a record for the fourth straight day despite predictions that the U.S. coronavirus epicenter could be shifting to the Midwest.The one-day loss of life in the state was roughly equivalent to the number of passengers on a single-aisle airplane.Florida also reported 9,007 new cases, bringing its total infections to over 470,000, the second highest in the country behind California.It is among at least 18 states that saw cases more than double in July, when almost 25,000 people in the United States died of Covid-19. The Prince of Wales gave a “morale boost” to health workers as he visited Caithness General Hospital in the north of Scotland.Staff at the hospital in Wick said they were “thrilled” to meet Charles, who is known as the Duke of Rothesay while in Scotland.During his visit on Friday, Charles thanked staff for their “dedication and hard work throughout the Covid-19 pandemic”, according to NHS Highland.Professor Boyd Robertson, chairman of the health board, said: “We were delighted to welcome His Royal Highness The Duke of Rothesay to Caithness General Hospital.“His Royal Highness spent time chatting with our staff to thank them for their efforts over the last few months and heard their experiences of working across a variety of health and social care roles during the Covid-19 pandemic.“All of the staff that met him were delighted and it has given the entire team a morale boost after such a demanding and challenging period.“I would like to thank His Royal Highness most sincerely for his visit to Caithness General Hospital.” The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 292,527.The biggest increases were from the United States, Brazil, India and South Africa, where deaths rose by a total of 6,812.The previous WHO record for new cases was 284,196 on 24 July.Deaths rose by 9,753 on 24 July, the second largest one-day increase ever.Deaths have been averaging 5,200 a day in July, up from an average of 4,600 a day in June.Northern Ireland could lead the way for spectators to return to football matches after a limited crowd attended the Irish Cup final in Belfast this evening.Just 500 supporters attended the final clash at the National Stadium at Windsor Park in a season that was plunged into uncertainty by the coronavirus pandemic.It was the first football match played in the United Kingdom since lockdown at which the players were cheered on by their own supporters.Fans were reminded to physically distance as they arrived by stewards wearing personal protective equipment. The death toll globally from coronavirus has surpassed 674,000, according to Johns Hopkins University’s tracker.The figure is now at 674,038, with the US having the most deaths at 152,074, followed by Brazil with 91,263.Donald Trump is on his way to Florida for an event with sheriffs, a round table on Covid response and storm preparedness and a fundraiser at a golf club in nearby Belleair.Florida governor Ron DeSantis is on his way to meet the president to request authorisation for more troop assistance in the Covid-19 crisis, which is affecting the state badly.It comes after it emerged that the US is no closer to an agreed national grand plan for tackling the Covid-19 outbreak that has killed more than 150,000 people in America and is still “raging out of control”.After questioning the public health experts on the White House coronavirus taskforce, there is no change from what the special coronavirus House committee chairman James Clyburn said when he criticised the Trump administration, saying it had “still not developed and implemented a national strategy to protect the American people” after more than six months of the outbreak.Families in the US trying to squeeze in a summer vacation before school starts better do some homework on Covid-19 restrictions before loading up the minivan.The web of state and local quarantines is growing more tangled by the day: New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have ordered visitors from a whopping 34 states to quarantine for 14 days.Chicago and Washington DC, have each singled out travellers from about two dozen states. Other states have their own lists. Some have an option for visitors to get tested instead.Kathy Kutrubes, owner of a travel agency in Boston, said: “Complicated doesn’t begin to describe it. I feel sorry for people.“They just want to go to Cape Cod. They want to go to Vermont. I don’t know what to tell them. People are pretty much left on their own to figure out.”The restrictions and maybe the confusion too are contributing to a sharp drop in travel, dealing a blow to a key industry.Before the outbreak, Americans were expected to take 2.3 billion domestic trips this year, according to the US Travel Association.Abroad, a drop-off in tourism from US visitors and restrictions on crossing borders have also led many travel-related businesses to wonder if they will survive.The Polish government is considering extra restrictions for the parts of the country with the most new coronavirus cases after the number rose by a record amount for the second successive day.“Limits could cover certain counties, the ones that have the biggest problems when it comes to a rise in infections,” government spokesman Piotr Muller told a press conference without specifying the areas.Of the new cases, 227 were in the Silesia region, where there has been an outbreak among coal miners.Muller also said that restrictions were unlikely to be nationwide and that the government would explore imposing quarantine measures on travellers from certain countries also facing a rapid growth in new cases.The health minister, Lukasz Szumowski, told private broadcaster Polsat News that new regulations could include an obligation in some counties to register weddings with authorities and inform them about who was attending.Szumowski said he expected the number of new daily cases to remain around 500-600 during the coming week before starting to fall. French health authorities reported 1,346 new confirmed coronavirus infections on Friday, which took the total to 187,919.New cases are above 1,300 per day for the third day in a row, the highest since late April.The health ministry also said that the number of people in intensive care units due to the disease fell by a further 10 to 371.On Thursday, that figure had increased by just one, which was the first daily increase after falling every day since 9 April.In the past 24 hours, 11 people died from the virus infection, taking the total to 30,265. In the past three days the number of dead per day was 16, 15 and 14.That’s all from me Caroline Davies . Thank you for your time Dr Anthony Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert, has told the US Congress he is “cautiously optimistic” that a “safe and effective” coronavirus vaccine will be available to the public by the end of 2020 during a hearing in Washington marked by testy exchanges between Fauci and senior Republicans loyal to Donald Trump.Fauci told US lawmakers on a House of Representatives subcommittee examining the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic that he was sceptical of fast-track vaccine efforts in Russia and China, suggesting the US would not need to depend on other countries for its own vaccine.“We hope that by the time we get into late fall and early winter, we will have in fact a vaccine that we can say that would be safe and effective. One can never guarantee the safety or effectiveness unless you do the trial, but we are cautiously optimistic this will be successful,” Fauci said in prepared remarks.He later added: “I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they’re administering the vaccine to anyone. I do not believe that there will be vaccines so far ahead of us that we will have to depend on other countries to get us vaccines.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Coalition will have to devise new plan following ruling of seven-judge courtHard data indicating scale of impact likely to be far greater than unreliable past forecastsProjections show flooding could have far-reaching negative effects globally by 2100"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318097.1596136727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"12 ways of avoiding dementia identified in major new study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals. Photograph:iStockModifying 12 risk factors over the course of one’s life could delay or prevent 40 per cent of dementia cases, according to the latest verdict of The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care.The commission has added three new “key modifiable risks factors” that make people more vulnerable to dementia excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life, suffering head injuries in mid-life and exposure to air pollution in later life. Led by 28 world-leading dementia experts, the report builds on the nine risk factors from childhood to later life identified in 2017, and provides an up-to-date analysis of the best evidence on the prevention of dementia. “The potential to prevent cases of dementia is high,” it adds.Its latest report presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on Thursday calls of states and iniduals to be ambitious about preventing dementia and lays out a set of policies and lifestyle changes to help prevent dementia. Worldwide around 50 million people live with dementia, a figure projected to increase to 152 million by 2050, rising particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where around two-thirds of people with dementia live. Dementia affects iniduals, their families, and the economy - with global costs estimated at about €1 trillion annually.Combined, the three new risk factors are associated with 6 per cent of all dementia cases – with an estimated 3 per cent of cases attributable to head injuries in mid-life 1 per cent of cases to excessive alcohol consumption (more than 21 units per week) in mid-life, and 2 per cent to exposure to air pollution in later life. The remaining risk factors are associated with 34 per cent of all dementia cases. The factors associated with the greatest proportion of dementia cases in the population are less education in early life hearing loss in mid-life, and smoking in later life (7 per cent, 8 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively).In certain countries, however, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, probably due to improvements in education, nutrition, healthcare, and lifestyle changes – demonstrating the possibility of reducing dementia through preventative measures, it concludes.“Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a significant proportion of dementia, with opportunities to make an impact at each stage of a person’s life,” says lead author Prof Gill Livingston of University College London, UK. “Interventions are likely to have the biggest impact on those who are disproportionately affected by dementia risk factors, like those in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities,” he added. Prof Livingston added: “As societies, we need to think beyond promoting good health to prevent dementia, and begin tackling inequalities to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives.” Risks could be reduced by creating active and healthy environments for communities, “where physical activity is the norm, better diet is accessible for all, and exposure to excessive alcohol is minimised”. The authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals: – Aim to maintain systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or less in midlife from around age 40 years– Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss reduce hearing loss by protecting ears from high noise levels– Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke– Prevent head injury (particularly by targeting high-risk occupations and transport)– Prevent alcohol misuse and limit drinking to less than 21 units per week– Stop smoking uptake and support iniduals to stop smoking (which the authors stress is beneficial at any age)– Provide all children with primary and secondary education– Lead an active life into mid, and possibly later life – Reduce obesity and diabetes. These actions, they say, are especially important in LMICs such as China, India and Latin America, where dementia rates are rising more rapidly than in high-income countries. This is due to increasing life expectancy, and a higher frequency of dementia risk factors such as lower rates of education high rates of hypertension, obesity, hearing loss and rapidly growing rates of diabetes. The authors note they were careful to only include risk factors with strong evidence for a causal link. Their report calls for holistic and inidualised evidence-based care that addresses physical and mental health, social care, and support that can accommodate complex needs of those with dementia. “Keeping people with dementia physically healthy is important for their cognition but they often have other illnesses which they may struggle to manage on their own, resulting in potentially harmful preventable hospitalisations,” it notes.

Photograph: Colin KeeganPeople who do not self-isolate after developing Covid-19 symptoms are putting others at risk, the acting chief medical officer has warned, after a survey showed the majority of patients who contacted GPs in the past week had not done so.Dr Ronan Glynn made the comments as the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported a further 38 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the State. This brings to 26,065 the total number of cases that have been confirmed in the Republic.No further deaths from Covid-19 were reported on Friday. There have been a total of 1,763 coronavirus-related deaths in the Republic.NPHET’s statement said a survey of GPs had indicated that the vast majority of patients who had contacted them with Covid-like symptoms in the past week had not been self-isolating since the onset of their symptoms.Dr Glynn said: “The importance of isolating as soon as you have any flu-like symptoms cannot be overstated. Without this inidual action we simply will not break the chains of transmission and we will put many people at risk of infection.“It is important that people know that there is no charge for GP or testing services relating to Covid-19. Please do not hesitate to contact your GP if you have any concerns.”Over the past two days a total of 123 cases have been reported, which Dr Glynn said was “a reminder to us all to double down efforts as we head into this weekend”.Of those, 84 cases were linked to known outbreaks or are close contacts of other confirmed cases, while at least 19 cases have been identified as community transmission.More than one-fifth of the 85 newly confirmed cases on Thursday were among workers at Irish Dog Foods in Naas. The factory, which employs about 200 people, closed a week ago for a deep clean while workers who tested positive were ordered to self-isolate.Overall forty-four of the cases were in Kildare, 33 in Dublin, 11 in Clare, 10 in Laois, eight in Limerick and the remaining 17 were across 10 counties.The median age of Friday’s cases was 30 years of age, with 82 per cent of the 38 being under 45.Dr Glynn, acting chief medical officer, said: “Mass testing has now taken place in relation to a number of known outbreaks.“We may be beginning to see more cases which we cannot link to outbreaks or close contacts. The National Public Health Emergency Team will continue to monitor this situation closely over the coming days.”Earlier, Dr Glynn said the focus on international travel had distracted from community efforts in Ireland to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, he said there was a risk that debate about Irish people going on foreign holidays could detract from the “core message” of each inidual having power to control the spread of the virus.He urged members of the public to follow six key pieces of advice as the bank holiday weekend approaches maintain social distance, stay outdoors when meeting people as much as possible, limit the time spent meeting them, wash hands, wear face masks and download the Covid-19 tracker app.Dr Glynn said a minority of cases detected in the Republic were linked to international travel, including just two of 85 cases reported on Thursday.“Ultimately what will dictate the course of the infection over the coming week, two weeks or in the coming months is the actions of each and every person in our communities across the country,” he remarked.Dr Glynn said the 85 new cases reported on Thursday – the highest daily number in two months – was not the time for “a knee-jerk reaction”.While not surprised by the number, as Covid-19 was a highly infectious virus, Dr Glynn said he was hopeful that the figures were the sign of “a blip” rather than signalling a more worrying trend.“We’re hopeful that what we are seeing in fact is evidence that our contact tracing system is working really, really well,” said Dr Glynn.He added: “The aim of that system is to detect the cases in clusters very rapidly and to break the chains of transmission.”Dr Glynn acknowledged that there was a higher risk of infection in any place where people were living together but he understood that all the measures were being taken to restrict the spread of the virus.“Even if people are doing the right thing, there will be times when this spreads quickly, particularly when people are working in close proximity to each other,” he observed.He advised the public that further clusters can be expected in various settings including workplaces, direct provision centres and family households.“The challenge for all of us is to identify them quickly to clamp down on them but to do that we need people to come forward quickly to say they’ve got the symptoms,” said Dr Glynn.He said it was important for people to remember that they do not have to be sick to transmit the virus to others.“We have to assume that everybody we meet is potentially at risk of infecting others and we have to act appropriately.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Placement of older people in nursing homes with infection control risks is \u0026lsquoindefensible\u0026rsquoGlynn stresses importance of quarantining after GPs\u0026rsquo survey shows lack of complianceFigures for June show 8,699 people in the State accessed emergency accommodationPunishment adequate for failing to vote with Government on Bill, Green leader saysBan on evictions, rent freezes ends on Saturday for all except tenants in arrears due to pandemicParty\u0026rsquos deputy leader lost Westminster seat to Sinn F\u0026eacutein\u0026rsquos John Finucane in electionO\u0026rsquoNeill says there is a \u0026lsquoconfused picture\u0026rsquo around travel regulations in North and SouthPaschal Donohoe says first few weeks of Government \u0026lsquocould have gone better\u0026rsquoGary Simpson was awarded \u0026euro7,500 over his conditions of detention in Mountjoy PrisonSiptu urges FF Sligo-Leitrim TD to recant \u0026lsquolying on the couch watching box sets\u0026rsquo remarkState appealed sentence given to man who assaulted three women he met on TinderCahir O\u0026rsquoHiggins (45) charged with stealing \u0026euro400 and perverting the course of justiceDepartment records 10 new Covid-19 cases while statistics agency reports four deaths in past weekCo Louth woman accused of membership of Islamic State group and terrorist financingEPA calls for greater efforts amid continuing decrease in rate of recyclingRe-wilding of lawns at the entrance are an effort to address bioersity crisisPath is \u0026lsquomoney well spent\u0026rsquo, says Green Party\u0026rsquos Eamon RyanMichael D Higgins says event highlights contribution of new Irish communitiesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4319101.1596226642!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"medical officers for nursing homes urged by oireachtas committee","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResidents in nursing homes  accounted for more than half of all Covid-19 related death. Photograph: iStockAcknowledgement that a lack of statutory clinical oversight in private nursing has been “one of the biggest weaknesses” exposed by the Covid-19 health crisis has been welcomed by an organisation supporting older people and patients. Sage Advocacy singled out the observation by the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee on Friday. The committee published an interim report setting out a series of recommendations on nursing homes whose residents were disproportionately affected by the outbreak. The document calls for the appointment of a designated medical officer in every nursing home. Sage executive director Mervyn Taylor said his organisation had highlighted a two-tier approach to the long-term support and care of older people which was “biased towards congregated settings”.“We have to urgently address the complete lack of clinical oversight of nursing homes and ensure that measures are put in place to integrate private nursing homes into the wider framework of health and social care,” he said. “The firm recommendation of the Oireachtas Committee in support of a single tier system of social care for older people is to be celebrated.” The report contains 19 recommendations. These include that health authorities take steps to ensure adequate staffing and infection control is in place ahead of any second wave.It says no patients should be discharged from hospitals to nursing homes with substandard infection control and that, more broadly, there is a need to develop independent living models for older people.Committee chairman Michael McNamara said the fact nursing home deaths have accounted for 56 per cent of the overall total shows the extent to which the older and most vulnerable were disproportionately affected.“The committee is strongly of the opinion that the lack of statutory clinical oversight of care for residents in the private nursing home sector is one of the biggest weaknesses exposed by Covid-19,” he said. The process focused on whether residents in nursing homes were adequately protected and the extent to which the crisis has highlighted the need for a different model of care – particularly one where more people would be cared for at home or in their communities. “It is evident that, if there is a second wave of the virus, different measures will be taken,” said Mr McNamara. “We know, for instance, that the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to nursing homes has been tightened up through testing and isolation procedures, which is welcome. However, the fact that the HSE still facilitates the placement of older persons in a nursing home with known infection control risks is, in the view of the committee, indefensible. This practice must end.”This committee is due to continue its work in September once it has examined a report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) on the impact of Covid-19 on nursing homes. It will also look to a forthcoming Expert Advisory Panel study.‘Absolutely vital’Mr McNamara said it will then be in a position to determine whether a public inquiry is necessary to examine the fate of residents from March to May 2020.Nursing Homes Ireland chief executive Tadgh Daly said the report “finds the public health authorities were slow to respond to the threat”. He said it was “absolutely vital” that recommendations for a comprehensive system of testing and tracing among nursing home staff continues along with stockpiling of personal protection equipment.In a broad criticism of official planning for the sector, Mr Daly said questions remained as to why nursing homes “were not a bigger priority in the preparations for the pandemic”. “The Committee needs to set a roadmap for Government to support a long-term sustainable model of care for older people in Ireland,” he said. The Irish Nurses and Midwifes Organisation said it supported the committee’s recommendation that staff ratios needed to be better regulated and based on the number of patients and their specific needs.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318585.1596212481!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shelbourne hotel statues do not depict slave girls says leading art historian","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A view of a statueless plinth at the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin.

Photograph: Wikimedia CommonsNineteenth century documentation proves conclusively that the statues taken down by the Shelbourne Hotel do not depict slave girls, an art historian has said.Kyle Leyden, who is a lecturer in the history of art and architecture at the University of London, says the original catalogue from which the four statues were ordered clearly label them not as slaves, but Egyptian and African women.Hotel management said on Tuesday they took the decision to remove the pieces, which have been in place for 153 years, in light of world events and the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to the legacy of slavery around the world.In a statement on Wednesday, Dublin City Council said it was “not aware of permission being granted to remove the statues concerned. “The matter is under investigation by the planning enforcement section and therefore no further comment can be made on the matter at this time.”The catalogue of the Val d’Orsne foundary in Paris, where the statues were cast, has been digitised and is available online.The statues were originally designed and sculpted by Mathirin Moreau (1822-1912) son of another famous French sculptor, Jean-Baptiste-Louis-Joseph Moreau.In 1849 he entered into an association with the Val d’Orsne foundry and became one of its directors.Under the arrangement, he supplied models to be cast and mass produced by the foundry, which could thus sell them on to architects under his name on the basis of his fame as a sculptor. They were sold to those who could not afford an original work.Mr Leyden said the architect who designed the Shelbourne facade, John McCurdy, would have ordered the four statues from the catalogue, which was published in the late 1850s.It was clear the from the catalogue that McCurdy ordered two “Égyptienne” female statues to stand astride the front doors of the hotel, and two other two statues entitled “Négresse” for either end of the front facade.The word “Négresse”, as used by the French in the mid-19th century, meant the female figure was of African origin, but not from North Africa.Mr Leyden explained that, if the statues were intended to depict Nubian slaves, they would have been classified as such because they were in vogue in the mid-1860s.. However, such statues were usually male or female nudes and were depicted in poses of servitude.The Shelbourne Hotel statues are of well-dressed females in an enlightened pose, he stressed.“’Nubian slave’ was a well-known and much fetishised nineteenth-century visual trope and to some buyers of statues would no doubt have been an attractive and very fashionable visual reference which was distinctly au courrant,” he said.“Verdi was writing Aida about a Nubian slave at precisely the time the Shelbourne was being built. If Moreau, the Val d’Orsne company or McCurdy had wanted a statue of a Nubian slave, they would have had no qualms about calling it precisely that.”Mr Leyden said the blame for categorising the statues as slave girls may lie with the novelist Elizabeth Bowen, who described them as “Nubian in aspect holding a torch-shaped lamp. Two of the four are princesses two are slave-girls”. That description was published in her 1951 book on the Shelbourne Hotel.“As anyone who has read it can attest, it was never intended to be an academic history of the hotel but rather a novelesque evocation of the place and its people,” Mr Leyden explained.“ It is not based on what we would today deem to be sound academic research. “Yet this reference has been repeated ad nauseam ever since. There is no source for the slave assertion save Bowen’s own romantic imagination coloured by her knowledge of nineteenth-century Orientalist literary tropes.“Indeed, several other statues in the catalogue (mainly male) are specifically labelled as Nubian, but not the two chosen at the Shelbourne. They are not slaves. They are not shackled. All four wear golden anklets as symbols of their aristocratic rank. They are all aristocratic women of Egypt and Africa.“Thus it seems likely McCurdy chose these statues firstly because their proportion suited his building. Secondly, their symbolic message was one of luxury, hinting at the deliciously licentious opulence of the new hotel. Choosing statues from the best art foundry in the world would also have had much currency in promoting the opulence of the hotel.” Mr Leyden said the Shelbourne Hotel had made a wrong decision in getting rid of the statues from their plinths and had clearly misrepresented them as the depiction of slaves.He suggested the issue could have been easily resolved by placing leaflets at the front door describing the provenance of the statues.“The statues could become commercial incentives to visits rather than an embarrassment and, should any problems arise, the leaflet will easily explain why they are there,” he said.Shelbourne Hotel management did not respond to a request for comment.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Infections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsAFP“The primary role of the vice-president of the United States of America is to support the president of the United States of America, give that president his or her best judgment when sought, and as vice-president, to preside over the Senate, only in a time when in fact there’s a tie vote.”These words from Joe Biden in 1998, as he eviscerated Dick Cheney as probably “the most dangerous vice-president” in American history, are a succinct synopsis of what the role of vice-president entails.As second-in-command at the White House, the position is sometimes one in search of a purpose. Previous holders of the post have shaped the office to varying degrees. Cheney is widely seen as the most powerful vice-president in history, as he presided over the invasion of Iraq, bolstered by an expansive view of executive power and a malleable president, George W Bush.Biden served as Barack Obama’s vice-president for eight years, and the relationship between the two was strong, despite personality differences between the ultra-controlled Obama and the loquacious Biden.Now Biden finds himself in the position of choosing his own running mate as November’s election approaches.The maxim that a vice-president is only a “heartbeat away” from the presidency – tragically realised by Lyndon Johnson, who was sworn in on the plane back to Washington after the assassination of John F Kennedy in Dallas – has never seemed so pertinent.If elected, Biden will be 78 years old when he is sworn in. The record is held by Donald Trump, who was 70 on inauguration day. Biden’s advanced age means it is quite likely that his running mate may ultimately become president.A dozen namesSpeculation is rife ahead of the announcement, expected as early as next week. Biden has already committed to picking a female candidate. There is also speculation that he will choose a woman of colour.The Biden campaign established a committee earlier this summer to lead the selection process, headed by former senator Chris Dodd. Approximately a dozen names are in the running.Senator Kamala Harris is widely seen as the top choice, though her history as a prosecutor in California is likely to come under scrutiny at a time when police reform is in the spotlight.Despite her clash with Biden in the first Democratic debate, when she lambasted his record on race, Harris’s friendship with his late son, Beau, when both were state attorneys general is likely to stand her in good stead.While selection committee chair Dodd was reported this week to have criticised Harris’s lack of remorse about her previous clash with Biden, an AP photographer captured her name at the top of Biden’s speaking notes at an event this week. Whether this was in anticipation of a question on the Dodd story, or an indication of her standing in the selection process, is unclear.Other figures to have emerged as contenders late in the race include race include former national security adviser Susan Rice, and Tammy Duckworth, an Asian-American congresswoman from Illinois and war veteran who lost both her legs in Iraq. Biden’s interest in military families is likely to help Duckworth’s case and she confirmed this week that she had been interviewed for the post.African AmericansTwo African-American members of Congress have also emerged as serious contenders. One is Karen Bass, chair of the Democratic Black Caucus, who was pictured chatting to Biden after he paid his respects to the late John Lewis at the US Capitol this week. Former Orlando police chief Val Demings is also in the running, though her former career may be a stumbling block in the current climate.Other names in contention are Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta. While Bottoms was relatively unknown before the George Floyd protests propelled her city into the national spotlight, she was an early supporter of Biden, travelling across Iowa in the campaign bus in January when most of the Democratic party had yet to endorse him.The last few months have seen some early favourites fall by the wayside. Amy Klobuchar’s record as prosecutor in Minnesota came under fire in the wake of the Floyd killing, while Elizabeth Warren’s chances are perceived to have diminished. Nonetheless, the Massachusetts senator is highly respected by Biden.One possibility doing the rounds in Washington is that Biden could offer her a position in his administration if elected –\u0026nbspperhaps even treasury secretary. An unapologetically left-wing senator who has taken on Wall Street in the treasury building?

The second hottest day was 38.5C reached on August 10 2003 in Faversham, Kent. Friday’s sweltering heat came as the Met Office released its annual State of the Climate report, in which it said climate change was exerting an increasing influence in the UK.After a dull July, which had only two-thirds of average sunshine for the month, more than 100,000 people descended on Bournemouth beach, keen to make the most of the heat. Dorset police said the area was “rammed” by 1pm and threatened to block off roads and put on extra patrols, in an attempt to avoid the crowds seen in the area last month. Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council encouraged beachgoers to use a new smartphone app that alerts visitors when sections of the beach are overcrowded, making social distancing impossible.Yvonne Jones, 66, a beach hut holder in Poole told the BBC that Boris Johnson should have made sure people stayed in their own counties.” She said: The traffic is horrendous - I live locally and it was a nightmare to get here. It\u0027s the locals who end up suffering.Motorists were being turned away from an overflowing car park in the luxury peninsula of Sandbanks in Dorset by 11am. Southeastern Railway put on extra trains to Ramsgate and Margate, but urged travellers to reconsider their journey because of the difficulty of social distancing. Thanet Council also asked beachgoers to stay away from its most popular spots, including Joss Bay, Botany Bay and Viking Bay. Brighton and Hove City Council issued a statement at 2pm telling people to stay away from the city because it could no longer enforce distancing. In a message on Twitter, the council said:  We\u0027re concerned about the number of people in the city. If you\u0027re not already here, please don\u0027t travel to the city today. There is limited capacity on public transport. Large numbers make it impossible to maintain physical distancing.Although cooler temperatures are expected on Saturday, it is still likely to be in the mid- to late-20Cs across the weekend, with the southeast particularly warm. Mr Partridge said: Both days are going to be mostly dry across the UK with sunny spells and some showers at times that may be out to the north and the west of the country.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"herd immunity long term solution covid 19 has become taboo says","story":"Herd immunity is the only long-term solution to Covid-19 but the idea has wrongly become “taboo”, a leading scientist has said.The concept currently “provokes hostility and controversy” but it must be revisited, according to Raj Bhopal, emeritus professor of public health at Edinburgh University.In a new article published in the journal Public Health in Practice, he argues that the Covid-19 pandemic has put ministers in a “zugwang” which is a position in chess where every move is disadvantageous and where every plan must be examined “however unpalatable” it might be.Herd immunity is when enough people become resistant to a disease - through vaccination or previous exposure - that it can no longer significantly spread among the rest of the population.With no vaccine available for Covid-19, herd immunity relies on enough people in the population becoming infected to lessen the impact of the disease.Prof Bhopal argues that even if a vaccine is found it may not work well for older people and those with underlying health conditions.The side-effects from a vaccine might also be worse for children and young people’s health than catching coronavirus in the first place.“Herd immunity provokes hostility and controversy as it is usually interpreted as allowing the pandemic to unfold without interventions. The concept needs revisiting,” his paper says.“If safe and effective vaccines and life-saving preventative and therapeutic medications are not found, lengthy lockdowns prove impossible, and the pandemic does not disappear spontaneously, population immunity is the only, long-term solution.”Prof Bhopal, who has advised the Government on public health issues, said that the 40-50 per cent infection rate that is needed to achieve herd immunity could be reached by allowing Covid-19 to spread among young and healthy people.“Allowing infection in those at very low risk while making it safer for them and wider society needs consideration but is currently taboo,” his paper says. Prof Bhopal told The Daily : Why do we not like herd immunity? Discussion of it has been closed down because people equate it with letting the pandemic rip through a population without any control measures at all. I am completely against that, it would be insane. I am not advocating that we dispense with all control measures, we still need to wash our hands, keep our distance and do everything we are being advised to. The bottom line is that older people have got a lot to gain from lockdowns and a lot to lose from the infection. Young people have a lot to lose from lockdowns and not much to lose from the infection.Our efforts should be directed towards protecting people who are at high risk. The concept of herd immunity prompted a backlash when it was first mentioned by the UK\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser in March.Sir Patrick Vallance said at the time that a degree of herd immunity will help the UK population as Covid-19 spreads.He explained that the aim was to reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely.Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.  Around 60 per cent of Britain\u0027s population would need to contract coronavirus in order for herd immunity to stave off the disease in future, he added.However, the Government quickly moved to distance itself from his remarks with the health secretary Matt Hancock insisting that herd immunity is a “scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy”.  Earlier this month, an Oxford University study suggested that the UK may have already achieved a sufficient level of herd immunity to stop a second wave of coronavirus.Scientists said that the threshold of herd immunity may have been lowered because many people may already be immune to the disease without ever having caught it.According to a new model produced by an Oxford University team led by Professor Sunetra Gupta, as little as 20 per cent of the population may need to be resistant to the virus in order to prevent a new epidemic spreading.However, Sussex University researchers have warned that predictions that herd immunity can be reached when fewer than 40 per cent of the population have been infected are “optimistic” and cannot be relied on.Professor Istvan Kiss from the university’s School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences said that such predictions could lull people into a “false sense of security” at a time when Covid-19 still poses a “great risk” to society.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"india scraps english mandatory language primary schools amid","story":"India will scrap the mandatory use of English in its primary schools, with subjects instead taught in Hindi or regional languages like Punjabi, for the first time since its independence in 1947.The controversial move is part of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, the largest educational shake-up in India in 34 years, which was spearheaded by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Hindu-nationalist youth wing, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).As part of the reforms, school syllabuses will focus on “ancient Indian knowledge”. Abolishing compulsory English is seen as a way to promote a united Indian identity from an early age.For much of the BJP’s support base, English is associated with colonial times and the old corrupt ruling Indian elite which followed afterwards and its abolishment as a mandatory language fits Mr. Modi’s wider policy of driving Indian nationalism.While only 0.02 percent of India’s 1.38 billion citizens speak English as a mother tongue, it was seen as the vital bridge in a erse country where 19,500 different languages and dialects are spoken.Parents took to social media to express their anger at the decision, saying it would reduce their children’s future employment prospects, with fluent English considered essential for highly-coveted and well-paid jobs overseas.In 2018, India was the highest recipient of remittances in the world - with over £60 billion sent home - with its citizens typically working in English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom and Australia.Aside from the decision to scrap English in primary schools, the NEP was received with enthusiasm by Indian parents.As part of the policy the Indian Government will increase its spending on education from 4.4 percent to six percent.India’s public education system is chronically underfunded, with a shortage of around 800,000 teachers nationally and over 75 percent more classrooms needed to meet demand in the northern state of Bihar.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew lobbied us government favourable epstein plea","story":"Friends of the Duke of York have said allegations he lobbied the US government to try to secure Jeffrey Epstein a “favourable” plea deal are a straightforward untruth, no ifs, no buts.In a scathing attack after the latest release of court documents from America, a friend told The  “precious few” claims against Prince Andrew had stood up, adding “allegations are not the same as facts.” Two alleged victims of the multi-billionaire financier claim Prince Andrew had tried to intervene to secure his former friend a so-called “sweetheart plea deal” back in 2008, new papers show.The women - named only as Jane Doe 1 and 2 - appealed for the release of more files which they say would prove the prince, as well as other high profile friends of Epstein, “lobbied” the US government for a lenient plea agreement.In 2008, Epstein pleading guilty to a reduced charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. His 18 month sentence - during which he worked from his Miami home - was vastly shorter than if he had been convicted of more serious sex charges.But, the two unnamed women and alleged victims of Epstein claimed: “(They are) seeking documents regarding Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the government to give him a favorable plea arrangement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew and former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.“They have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the non-prosecution agreement his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and political connections to lobby the justice department to obtain a more favorable plea deal.”Their comments emerged in papers from a now settled 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, 36, one of Epstein’s alleged victims who claimed Prince Andrew was among the powerful people she was persuaded to have sex with when aged just 17.Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied the claims.The Duke moved to distance himself from his former friend after the conviction, meeting with him on only one occasion in New York in 2010 to formally cut ties.“Allegations are not the same as facts, which is the essential premise on which justice works.  “Let’s see if these allegations stand-up, because precious few about the Duke do – where’s the proof?”Ghislaine Maxwell, 58, the British socialite and former girlfriend of Epstein, had fought unsuccessfully to keep the files secret. In another part of her deposition, Ms Giuffre is asked by her lawyers in 2016 if Prince Andrew would have relevant information that could help investigators.Yes, he would know a lot of the truth, she said of the Duke. I don’t know how much he’d be able to help you with, but seeing as he’s in a lot of trouble himself these days I think he might, so I think he might be valuable.Ms Giuffre, now 36, claims that she was forced to have sex with Epstein, who in turn forced her to have sex with a number of his associates. Epstein instructed Jane Doe to give Prince Andrew whatever he demanded and required her to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse, the lawyers alleged, insinuating that Epstein was potentially using her to gather incriminating evidence on the Prince.It is believed the Jane Doe here is Ms Giuffre.Ms Giuffre in other parts of the testimony says the now famous photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around her waist in a London mansion was taken by Epstein on her Kodak camera. She says she gave the picture to the FBI during their investigations in 2011.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2012/11/01/22/fernbritton2-bbc.jpg","title":"britains got talent itv fern britton amanda holden piers morgan","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Former ‘This Morning’ presenter sat on the judging panel for the show’s pilot episode, it has been revealedFern Britton was originally cast as a judge on Britain’s Got Talent instead of Amanda Holden, the show’s original commissioner has revealed.The ITV talent show launched in 2007 with Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan and Amanda Holden as its judges.However, commissioner Claudia Rosencratz has disclosed that it was originally Britton who sat behind the table.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking to , Rosencratz said, “I had Fern Britton on the panel, the original pilot we did.

Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.UK economy has recovered around half of its coronavirus hitSpain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended on  21 June.France also reported a precipitous 14 per cent contraction in the second quarter when the country was in lockdown.The country’s startling plunge of 13.8 per cent in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France’s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.Analysts forecast that Europe’s economic recovery is unlikely to be rapid. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “There are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that eurozone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target.

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don\u0027t know if someone is positive or negative, Mr Paumier said.But the objective is to follow these people, especially those who are positive, to follow them up, and find out who they\u0027ve been in contact with.The countries affected are:\u0026nbspSouth Africa, Kuwait, Qatar, Israel, Brazil, Peru, Serbia, Algeria, Turkey,\u0026nbspMadagascar, India and Oman.\u0026nbspReutersVietnam reports second coronavirus death on same day as firstTwo people have now died in Vietnam, according to the health ministry.Both deaths were reported on Friday.The country has recorded 546\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspinfections since its first cases were detected in January.Additional reporting by ReutersNorthern Ireland coronavirus deaths rise for first time since mid-JuneNorthern Ireland has recorded a rise in coronavirus-related deaths\u0026nbspfor the first time since mid-June.Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate for seven deaths registered in the week ending 24 July, up five from the week before, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra).This brings the total number of Covid-19 related deaths registered in the region in 2020 to 853.Those aged 75 and over have accounted for 80.1 per cent\u0026nbspof Covid-19 related deaths.The number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health for the same period was 556.Those figures are based on patients who had previously tested positive for the virus.The department today said 10 more positive cases of coronavirus had been detected in the region, bringing the total number infected to 5,948.No new deaths were recorded, leaving the total at 556, according to the department.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In it, Moore stars as Jules, a lesbian who is raising two children with her partner Nic (Annette Bening). Speaking to Variety, Moore said, “Here we were, in this movie about a queer family and all of the principal actors were straight. I look back and go ‘Ouch, wow’.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe continued, “I don’t know that we would do that today, I don’t know that we would be comfortable.“We need to give real representation to people, but I’m grateful for all the experiences that I’ve had as an actor because my job is to communicate a universality of experience to the world.”Glenda Jackson: ‘My family’s anxious every time I sneeze’Oliver Stone says his films would be ‘vilified’ todayAndrew Scott forced to miss Three Kings performances for minor surgeryThe 2010 Oscar-nominated film was praised upon release, but also drew criticism for casting two straight actors in queer roles.Regarding the casting, the film’s director Lisa Cholodenko told Variety that it was a “super interesting argument”. “While I want to promote gay people representing gay people, trans people, all the rest, queer people, it’s also a commercial prospect,” she added.Cholodenko added that she cast Moore and Bening because “I could feel their gayness. It didn’t feel phony to me. I didn’t feel like I was putting somebody in an outfit and asking them to parade something that was false”.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The increase is the first likely rise in cases since May.The agency’s infection survey data for 31 July said: “Modelling of the rate of new infections over time suggests that there is now some evidence that the incidence of new infections has increased in recent weeks.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

The statue of Robert Baden-Powell on Poole Quay is to be placed in safe storage following concerns about his racial viewsIt added: “While the percentage of iniduals testing positive for Covid-19 has decreased since the start of the study (26 April 2020), there is now evidence to suggest that it has been rising slightly in recent weeks.“Further analysis indicates that we can be confident that there was a real, small increase in the most recent estimated daily infection rate when compared with the lowest daily rate from the last six weeks, which was 0.05 per cent.”The announcement came as the government called on households in areas of the north of England to no longer mix with others in private residences and hospitality businesses.Meanwhile, planned easing of restrictions around wedding receptions and indoor entertainment businesses have been put on hold, and face masks will be mandatory in cinemas, museums and places of worship from next weekend.Commenting on the figures at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said: “Around one in 1,500 now have the virus compared to one in 1,800 on the 15th of July and one in 2,000 on the 2nd of July. The ONS also estimates that there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on the 14th of July and 2,000 per day at the end of June.”“We just can’t afford to ignore this evidence,” he added, saying it was “vital to stress, of course, that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic”.Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day\u0027\u0026nbsp“I have lost five kilos in the last three or four weeks because of stress and because work has been so hostile,” Lottie Pope tells The Independent. “I feel like it is bullying. I go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 3am and can’t go back to sleep because my brain is frantic. It is exploding with stress.”Ms Pope, a former social media manager for an insurance firm, was recently laid off from her job during the public health emergency and believes she was discriminated against for being a mother.A spate of recent studies have suggested the coronavirus crisis is exacerbating gender inequality - with a report by the University of Exeter finding women are almost twice as likely as men to have lost their job during the pandemic. Researchers found seven per cent of women have been made redundant during the lockdown in comparison to four per cent of men.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile a report by PwC, published in May, found 78 per cent of those who had already lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 emergency were women.“At the beginning of the lockdown, we were asked to take a 20 per cent pay cut,” Ms Pope, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, says. “I said: \u0027I can’t afford that because I’ve got childcare to pay for\u0027. And then they said: \u0027You have a choice to be put on furlough or be made redundant\u0027. It was a punishment. I also asked them if could I reduce my hours by 20 per cent because I was homeschooling but they expected me to still be full-time.”The women facing lockdown burnout as they juggle jobs with childcareThe 30-year-old, who is a single parent, said hours earlier she had been told she was “critical” to the company and would be working throughout the crisis. But her bosses attitude changed dramatically when she did not agree to take the pay cut, she added.“Social media is a critical, vital thing which can definitely be done from home,“ the mother-of-one adds. ”I had a junior person below me and they kept the junior person. She doesn’t have kids. I feel like it was a case of them discriminating against me because I have a child. I was homeschooling and working full time from home at the beginning of the lockdown. It was so stressful. Now I’m not sleeping at all. I feel really highly strung and I’m very worried about money. I’ve filed a grievance. I can’t take them to an employment tribunal because I worked there for under two years.”A recent London School of Economics study found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a greater proportion work in sectors that are forecast to be most badly affected. More women work in hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — industries where thousands of workers have already been furloughed or made redundant.Jamie Bird, who lives in West London and previously worked in the education sector, was furloughed in March before being laid off in June.  “I was laid off on the anniversary of my best friend\u0027s death,” the 38-year-old adds. I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day. I\u0027ve been feeling pretty down since losing the job. I don\u0027t have any kids but it\u0027s affected my mental health a lot. I\u0027ve lost a job and a relationship so it\u0027s been hard dealing with both. I don\u0027t sleep as well because obviously I\u0027m worried about finding another job and how I\u0027m going to pay for bills and other expenses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe gender bias revealed by coronavirus needs fixingMs Bird said the current job market is “awful” and she fears she is being discriminated against due to her age - adding that it feels like employers are taking on apprentices due to them being cheaper than someone who has more experience.“I applied for universal credit but was denied any for reasons they haven\u0027t explained so I\u0027m out of a job with no income and no help and that\u0027s tough,” she adds. “I think that it\u0027s atrocious that women are more likely to lose their job in the pandemic than men, we work equally as hard and sometimes even harder and yet we still don\u0027t seem to have bridged that gap between being treated as equally in the workplace environment.” Gemma Hirst, who lives in Newcastle, has been forced to start claiming universal credit since losing her job in retail during the coronavirus crisis.“I worked for the clothes company for five years and got promoted,” the 25-year-old says. “During lockdown, I got furloughed. A couple of months down the line, the shop I was at was closing down but they said I could be moved to another store. But they cut my hours and demoted me so I was no longer a supervisor. I didn’t want that so they made me redundant”.Ms Hirst said she had never lost a job before or been without work but she lucky enough to live with her parents - adding that if she was living alone, the universal credit would not be enough to live on.“It would be a tough existence,” she says. “It is scary because there are hardly any jobs out there. When I apply for jobs I get emails saying that the application is on pause due to the pandemic. I have no idea what would happen if I didn\u0027t have family. It doesn’t bear thinking about. I think I would be homeless. I have good days and bad days. There are some days where I think ‘what am I going to do?’ and I am anxious about the future and worried about what is to come.”She said her best friend, who has three children, had been catapulted into a state of panic since being laid off from her job in a care home for the elderly.  “She was struggling to get childcare and her employer said we don’t want you,” Ms Hirst adds. “She was crying. She is a wreck because she has three children to look after on her own.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.In Bradford, it was not the decision itself which caused shock or frustration. It was the timing.When Matt Hancock announced late on Thursday night that the West Yorkshire city would be part of a swathe of northern England where coronavirus restrictions were to be tightened, many people here had long expected it. The place, as they point out, has consistently been among England’s top Covid-19 hot spots.What few could have imagined, however, was that the new guidelines – essentially banning friends and family from meeting in homes and gardens – would come at 9.30pm on the eve of Eid al-Adha, a major Islamic festival celebrated by gathering with loved ones.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Can you imagine them pulling this shit on Christmas Eve?” as one Bradfordian asked The Independent on Friday afternoon. “No way would that have happened.”Astonishment at the lack of notice was not, of course, confined to the Wool City, where a quarter of the city’s 534,000 population are Muslims.Riots ‘worse than 2011’ could hit UK amid rising tensions – SageMr Hancock’s late-night announcement that a new lockdown would be introduced across Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and a large chunk of West Yorkshire from midnight was met with widespread dismay almost immediately.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the surprise bombshell a “new low for the government’s communications”. Jason McCartney, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley, broke party ranks to express “surprise and disappointment”. The Police Federation of West Yorkshire was less polite, describing the situation as: “Nonsense.”Yet on Bradford’s streets on Friday – in Centenary Square and near the Grand Mosque, down by the Wool Exchange and around Kirkgate’s shopping quarter – that frustration was almost palpable.Some suggested the government was deliberately targeting Eid celebrations with the new guidelines. Others argued that, given the apparent increase in spread, the new action was needed. But almost all criticised the timing.“First, you need to acknowledge the data doesn’t lie,” said Shadim Hussain, chief executive of the My Foster Family charity. “The virus is alive and deadly and it’s here in Bradford, and we know that BAME communities are at higher risk so I think people understand the need for restrictions. I don’t think anyone has an issue with that. People understand the government is trying to keep the country safe.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“The frustration is why they chose to make this decision when they did,” the 41-year-old father-of-four said. “It shows a lack of sensitivity and empathy to the thousands of people who have prepared everything for Eid, bought food, cooked food, made their plans. It’s been a really long and tough lock down, and people have been looking forward to this and the lack of warning before essentially cancelling all those celebrations is difficult to accept or to comprehend.”Many people he knows, he said, were already in the middle of family visits planned around the festive period.“They’ve woke up today to find themselves literally braking the law,” he added. “It’s farcical.”It was a view repeatedly echoed by others in this city.“I’m not going home this year anyway,” said student Mustapha Patel, who comes from Lancaster but studies mechanical engineering at the university here. “Too much work on. But I guess it’s a good job I didn’t have plans now, isn’t it?”The 24-year-old was just leaving the city’s jaw-dropping Grand Mosque when we spoke. How were people feeling?“Confused, mainly,” he said. “I’m not sure anyone knows what we are and what we aren’t allowed to do anymore.”Not everyone, it may be worth noting, was planning on sticking to the new guidelines.“There’s no way I’m not seeing my family today,” said Abdul Rabeen, walking through Centenary Park. “I’m going there now, parents, brothers, sisters, we’ll all be there. Why shouldn’t we?”Well, because of the contagion? And because it’s now against the law?“I think it’s a fuss over nothing,” he said. “What will be will be. Why would I trust the government to keep me safe anyway?”As The Independent took a photo of the 40-year-old insurance seller, he chose to touch his face to emphasise his lack of concern. As you do.In any case, nor was it just those celebrating Eid left dismayed by the short notice restriction.Outside the Turls Green – a Wetherspoon pub currently looking out onto a coronavirus testing tent – Nathan Jones was ruefully contemplating his own unexpected tangle with the guidelines.The 30-year-old was up here from Newquay visiting friend, Abigail Boyd. “Am I even still allowed to be here?” he wondered sipping his drink. “Are we allowed to be drinking together?” he asked his companion.It was, perhaps, a question for Mr Hancock himself – although, given the health secretary’s somewhat confused replies to similar queries in a series of media interviews hours earlier, it wasn’t entirely clear if even he would know.How did Abigail, a Bradfordian, feel about the new restrictions? “I’m sort of surprised it didn’t happen sooner,” the 24-year-old chef said. “Every time I look at those Covid tables, we’re always near the top. I just hope this finally works and life can get back to normal.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boris Johnson’s government has confused and alienated the public on crucial health messages with its “deplorable” last-minute announcement of changes to coronavirus rules, experts have claimed.The Independent Sage group of scientists said the government’s failure to explain the new regional ban on different households meeting indoors with any clarity would damage public engagement with the guidance, which is soon to be law.The announcement of a ban on indoor gatherings in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and east Lancashire – which also covers the city of Leicester – was made at about 9.15pm on Thursday via a series of tweets and a short TV clip by health secretary Matt Hancock.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“This is no way to handle a pandemic,” said Professor Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine. “It seemed designed to undermine public confidence.”Professor Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at UCL, added: “Having such sudden announcements is very damaging from the point of view of morale and people’s engagement.Further lockdown lifting postponed as coronavirus cases rise – liveMuslim leaders have condemned the government for the “shockingly short notice” of new restrictions, which was announced just before the Eid festival began. The new rules ban people in affected regions from meeting each other inside homes or in gardens.The government announced that pubs, cafes, restaurants – and places of worship – can reopen in Leicester from Monday following four weeks in more extensive lockdown than the rest of the country. But people from different households in Leicester cannot meet in homes or gardens.The Independent Sage panel condemned the “inconsistencies and apparent insensitivities” in the announcement.“There’s an inconsistency when people are told you can go to pubs, which is not an appropriate place to celebrate Eid, but you can’t do this in private gardens – which is a lot safer,” said Professor Michie.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, however, said “announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis”.Boris Johnson announced on Friday that measures due to be lifted on Saturday across England – including allowing small wedding receptions and reopening bowling alleys and casinos – have been postponed for at least two weeks.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

Even before the postponement of the election was confirmed, opposition figures had cautioned that any such move would be treated with suspicion.On Thursday, the Hong Kong government had already barred 12 influential opposition figures from running for seats on the city’s Legislative Council.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Much of the law is considered to be tailor-made to target and criminalise those leading the protests. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the law would be a “sharp sword” hanging over the heads of a “tiny number of people” endangering national security.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful. Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someones home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.The mixup came as England was hit with  new positive cases – the highest number in  days – adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.But the sudden new rules - which means that people can still go to work and even visit shops and cafes - have left Brits reeling after they were introduced about .pm, barely three hours before they were put into force.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to discuss the matter in his coronavirus press conference today.What the new rules mean:About .million people will be affected by the new lockdown rules - which are expected to be subject to a weekly review.The affected areas include all of the .million residents of Greater Manchester, as well as the Lancashire towns of Blackburn, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.West Yorkshire, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees were also hit.Leicester was also included in the households ban, but pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will reopen on Monday.However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.Earlier Mr Hancock has admitted Muslims living in the area will have their Eid celebrations affected.He said: My heart goes out to the Muslim community. I know that this will have a particular impact on Eid celebrations. Weve been working with Imams and religious leaders to ensure that Eid celebrations can go ahead in a co-vid secure way in mosques and there are some really innovative proposals to celebrate in parks where social distancing is easier and theres more space. But it does mean, for everybody, meetings between households wont be possible and of course that has a particular impact when theres a celebration like Eid coming up for the Muslim community. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi today slammed the lack of clarity over the message on Good Morning Britain, saying she had received calls up to am overnight by confused members of the community.She said: “There is still not clarity on whether that means you can meet outdoors, thankfully there is still some clarication that those mosques that had prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures would be allowed to go ahead.“People have voluntarily been part of this response and I think it would have been better to do this with a little more understanding and clarity.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would not argue with local action to reduce the transmission of the virus but said: Announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.He added: For all the bluster, government has failed to deliver a ing track and trace system that would spot local flare ups like these.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said she had been blindsided by the new rules.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning was left trying to defend the move, saying the move had been absolutely necessary.Speaking to Sky News, he said the new rules were crystal clear, saying the test and trace data had shown most of the transmission is happening between households.He added: Everyone can see that the problem with this virus is it thrives on the social contact that makes le worth living.The Health Secretary had last night said he was introducing the new measures with a heavy heart - tweeting the announcement at .pm with details published two hours later before the full guidelines were released this morning.Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there had been a “marked change” across his boroughs in recent days.Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, he said: The truth of the matter is the pub is a more regulated environment, as is public transport where people are supposed to wear face masks.The home is a less regulated.And he defended the sudden introduction of the new guidelines, saying the virus could move quickly.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey wrote: How this lockdown in Manchester, East Lancs  West Yorks has been introduced is worrying, confusing, frustrating and damaging.No-one doubts these are dficult decisions - but when lives of millions of people are involved, Ministers have a duty to communicate professionally.Others took issue with Wigan being included in the fresh lockdown rules, saying that it had been lumped in with Greater Manchesters rise without recording an increase itself.One local tweeted: Wigan has the lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester... its not our fault other parts of Manchester are letting the side down.Another added: Wigan has  cases per , and is on lockdown. City of London has  cases per , and no lockdown. Wonder why that is.The shock announcement came after Boris Johnson warned between ten and  places in Britain are seeing Covid- cases “bubbling up”.Speaking in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, the PM said yesterday: “There are between ten and  places where you are seeing it bubbling up a little bit.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The R rate has become an essential way of the government measuring its success in dealing with coronavirus in the UK.It measures the rate of infection that averages how many people are being infected by one person, with officials using this data to guide the UK out of lockdown.Scientists use it to predict how far and how fast a disease will spread - and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadlyThe R rate indicates how fast coronavirus is likely to spread, and it ies across the UK.Speaking at a press conference this afternoon Mr Johnson said he would not let the virus threaten more heartache across the country.He today announced that some businesses that were set to open tomorrow will no longer be able to open their doors.Place such as casinos and bowling alleys will no longer be able to reopen and this guidance will be updated in two weeks.The Prime Minister also said that he wasnt willing to take the risk when it comes to weddings.Wedding receptions of up to  people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can go ahead with the Covid guidlines, he said.He did however say that shielding rules will still be relaxed from tomorrow, allowing more vulnerable people to get back to normal le.Mr Johnson said the government would study the data and would re-open when we can.However chief medical officer Chris Whitty said we are likely to be at the limit of what we can do when it comes to opening up society once more.Dr Daniel Lawson, Lecturer in Statistical Science, School of Mathematics, University of Bristol said the data from the ONS provides some data of an increase.When cases are low, the average reproduction rate can still be below  but we can see an increase in cases by chance, because cases tend to occur in bursts within a community, which should be capturedtest and trace systems are working.  We can also see an increase in cases by changes in testing or reporting.“Decisions must be made in the face of this uncertainty, such as the announcement that the UK is pausing easing.He added that evidence from Europe implies that we should take the apparent increase seriously, as acting too late can make lockdowns longer and increase mortality.Dr Lawson added that the UK is close to the tipping point and said we should prepare for further rapid action.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It needs fixing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. And he added: “Most people, including our Committee, broadly agree with the original aims and objectives of Universal Credit. However, in its current form it fails to provide a dependable safety net. It has led to an unprecedented number of people relying on foodbanks and not being able to pay their rent.He said some features of the system were harming women, disabled people and the vulnerable.And he added: “Universal Credit needs more money to catch up after  years of cuts to the social security budget and substantial reform to its design.“The five-week wait for a first payment must be replaced by a non-repayable two-week grant to all claimants.The Lords report also recommends that the punitive taper rate should be reduced - another aim of The Suns campaign - to encourage more people into work.And it says all claimants should have a higher work allowance to allow them to keep more of their hard-earned cash too.The Lords also conclude that including childcare support in Universal Credit was a mistake and paying in arrears is a huge barrier to work - as we have repeatedly highlighted.In some cases it has been a disincentive to work, the report says.The Government should remove childcare support from Universal Credit and be made into a new standalone benefit paid, it added.Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said of the report: “Sadly, this report confirms what many have known for a long time – Universal Credit is simply not working. There is clear consensus that the system is not delivering on its objectives and is instead pushing people further into poverty and debt.Ministers should listen to their Conservative colleagues’ calls for a reformed social security system.The DWP said in response to the report it would consider their recommendations in detail.Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said of the report: “The case for Universal Credit has never been stronger. The system defied its critics in unprecedented and unforeseeable circumstances, processing more than .m new claims at pace since mid-March and paying more than a million advances worth hundreds of millions of pounds to those in urgent need within days.“We remain committed to supporting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we currently spend over £ billion a year on the benefits system. We’ve also increased the Universal Credit standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion.“We welcome the acknowledgement by the Committee that Universal Credit is here to stay and we will consider their recommendations in detail.”IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Greater Manchester Mayor said there were gaping holes in the system, which would cause unacceptable risk to communities. And he called for support for aposshieldingapos people - due to be ended across England tomorrow - to be extended for regions under increased restrictions.Holding a press conference in the wake of his region being placed under stricter coronavirus restrictions, he called for the government to be clearer in communicating changes.He said: We would strongly recommend to the government that at the time a public or media statement is made affecting any area across the country, it must then follow that detailed information is immediately available at the same time as the making of that statement. He added: We feel that would have led to a much better handling of the information in this case...that didnapost happen here, and I think that has caused some uncertainty and confusion and stress for some of our residents. Mr Burnham said he was only given a matter of hoursapos notice before the new restrictions were introduced in a pm tweet and statement from Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday night. The Mayor said there were holes in the governmentaposs Test and Trace system - which identies people who have contracted coronavirus and tries to track down people they have been in contact with. Mr Burnham called for more data sharing from the national system to local government. If the national team havenapost managed to reach someone whoaposs tested positive for Covid- within a day or so then their details should be escalated to the local authority. He said local teams had a much higher success rate in reaching positive cases. And he called for more financial support for lower paid workers who are ordered to stay at home by contact tracers. He said: There are many people in the areas which have recently been subject to these new restrictions - Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, East Lancashire - who are not employed in jobs that support them to self-isolate. They know they may not be paidthey do that in a zero-hours job, or indeed they may fear they may lose their jobthey self-isolate.  He said even for those who have access to Statutory Sick Pay, it isnapost high enough. We feel this explains one of the reasons for lower success rate of the national test and trace system in more deprived areas. People know they canapost say to the person calling them what they want to hear. Or also theyaposre reluctant to give the names of contacts knowing that they wonapost be in a position either to listen to whataposs being said. He called on the government to urgently address the issue, reaching an agreement with employers for all employees to get two weeks of full paytheyaposre asked to self-isolate. If we donapost fix that hole in the system our test and trace arrangements will not be strong enough going into the winter, and they need to be, he added.  Mr Burnham also called on the government to extend support for aposshieldingapos people at increased risk from Covid- until the local restrictions are eased again. The shielding point I think is tremendously important. It cannot feel right for someone being at home today whoaposs been shielding for months, to hear that new restrictions are coming in in Greater Manchester and to fear what that might mean - and then to hear that aposoh, your support is about to be withdrawn and you have to go out to the shops to get your own.apos Clearly the government must be able to see that there is a mismatch in that messaging that will cause real anxiety in peopleaposs minds.

There were indeed jobs to be done, and he did them – leaving a postwar legacy that still lives on today.It is  years since he became Prime Minister, beating Winston Churchill in the general election in July .For the next six years he led a government that would transform the country and lay the foundations on which so much that we value in this country still rest. These achievements were all the more remarkable given that they were forged in the gloom of an economy broken by war and with a Cabinet riven by rivalries, distrust and raging egos. Attlee made an unlikely revolutionary – an ex-public schoolboy who had seen active service in the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign. Nye Bevan, a constant thorn in his side, was withering about his boss’s “suburban middle-class values. Yet he oversaw a government that created the welfare state, gave birth to the NHS and rescued the country from the rubble of the Second World War. Biographer John Bew writes in Citizen Clem: “That he was unthreatening and unexotic did not mean he was not bold, courageous and sometimes radical.” On entering Downing Street on July , , Attlee inherited a country on the verge of bankruptcy. More than two million troops needed to be demobilised and ed to work, industrial output had ground to a halt, and there was a housing crisis caused by the Blitz. The domestic challenge was matched by the foreign one. Britain’s position on the world stage was at risk from the rise of the Soviet empire and the demand for independence from colonial states. The task was daunting, but Attlee was blessed with a high-calibre Cabinet including no-nonsense Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, Chancellor Hugh Dalton, Ellen Wilkinson on education, Stafford Cripps at the Board of Trade and, most famously perhaps, Nye Bevan as Minister for Health. The founding of the NHS is regarded as the signature policy of the Attlee years, but just as impressive were the National Insurance Act that provided the first comprehensive welfare system, the New Towns Act and the building of over , council houses. Rail, coal and electricity were taken into public ownership. Trade union rights were improved, sick pay extended and health and safety measures introduced. They even created our first national parks.But his legacy goes beyond his domestic achievements. He began the process of dismantling the British Empire by granting India and Pakistan independence in . Attlee and Bevin were the driving force behind the creation of NATO in  which bound America into Western Europeansecurity for generations to come.More controversially, Attlee made sure Britain had its own nuclear deterrent, a decision taken without debate in Parliament or the Labour Party, and despite straining the finances of a country on the edge of bankruptcy.Bevin said Attlee was set on having “an atomic bomb with a Union Jack on it”. Tensions in Cabinet were never far from the surface. When told Bevan was his own worst enemy, Bevin quipped: “Not while I’m alive, he isn’t.” Attlee found himself struggling to keep unity in the party as the economic dficulties mounted. There was a fuel crisis in  and the devaluation of the pound in .  The continuation of rationing remained a constant source of irritation. At the February  generalelection Labour squeezed home with a majority of five. A few months later Nye Bevan resigned in protest at plans to charge for prescriptions.Attlee called a snap election in  to try to win a clear majority but, despite winning the popular vote, lost power to his rival Churchill. The Cabinet was physically exhausted and the isions within the party were becoming harder to contain. Only later could they look back on how much they had achieved in such extraordinary circumstances.

I shall just have to communicate with you more clearly.And Matt Hancock agrees. He is, as he felt necessary to point out to Radio  listeners this morning, the Health Secretary in the middle of a global pandemic, so you will excuse me for being concerned about the health of the British public. Yeah. Itaposs the other stuff thereaposs no excuse for, Matthew.Announcing a local lockdown,  hours before it began, for .m people on a social media site whose users are % affluent millennials, Mr Hancock said: The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing.Except the government messaging on social distancing is so chaotic that % of Brits have no idea what the rules are any more.When was the last time you heard a government minister remind you to wash your hands  Itaposs been weeks*. Compare that, class, to the last time you heard a government minister say that masks were not really necessary. You may find that one has been signicantly more recent, and effective, than the other. The people of Rochdale, Leicester, Blackburn, Burnley, Calderdale, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bradford, Hyndburn, Pendle, and Greater Manchester are more likely to be meeting up with others in non-socially distant situations because thataposs the nature of the jobs they are more likely to do, and Boris Johnson ordered them all back to work a fortnight ago. Those areas have lower wages, higher occupancy housing, and more manufacturing. More towns, and fewer villages. None of those things are consistent with staying metres apart, and a month ago the government told them not to bother so much with that, anyway.The people who live there are also more likely to have health conditions which make them more susceptible, and the government told them to stop shielding yesterday . Worldwide, the two factors consistently linked to lower coronavirus rates are early lockdowns and comprehensive testing.We locked down late, as even the Prime Minister grudgingly half-agrees, and our world-beating test and trace system is about the worldaposs worst. Of the .m coronavirus home testing kits sent through the post, only m have been processed. These privately-provided, non-NHS tests are complex, unpleasant, must be collected quickly to be viable, and some people report them being damaged or dropped in a puddle by the courier. Eventhey are sent back, the chances of a  negative are somewhere between  in  and  in . Either way, .m people who should have been tested werenapost. And a fortnight ago, Hancock announced an urgent review of... the way deaths are counted, which may be a few hundred out and therefore making the government look so much worse than it really is. Caposmere, thereaposs more! In June it was revealed that outsourced, inexperienced, Serco tracers contacted an average of . people each. Trained Public Health England officials found  people each. The multi-million-pound private contracts which lost .m tests and needed  members of staff to trace  human were in the gt of, under the oversight of, and signed off by, Matt Hancock.And just yesterday he told the Royal College of Physicians that in future the health service must draw on the ideas and expertise of the private sector because people donapost care who has provided the test. They care itaposs not you, Matt.And he added that bureaucracy - translation: public servants whoaposve done a better job than him thus far - must be cut. There are no ideologues in a pandemic, he trilled, despite the fact he has stuck to the ideology of a competitive, open market in healthcare through the piling-up of, to date, , corpses.  The government guidance, issued overnight on the same fag packet that contains all the previous guidance, says people can go to restaurants with members of their own households, but not pubsthereaposs a stranger there.They can leave the restricted area to go to work, but people from outside the restricted area cannot come to visit. They cannot meet people in gardens, but they can meet in parks. They should use public transport, and must use masks, but no-one will tell them offthey donapost. Oh, and it also claims West Yorkshire is now in the North West. See, Matt, this is why no-one listens to you. You couldnapost find your arse with a map, because you canapost read a map. But itaposs not Mattaposs fault. No. Itaposs the Spanish, whose infection rate is still lower than ours, or the second wave that is not sweeping Europe. For preference, though, itaposs the disease-ridden Muslims the finger is pointed at. So letaposs pepper the order to lockdown with references to the Islamic festival of Eid-al-Adha, which canapost be blamed for any of this because it only started yesterday.Matt does hope you have a nice time, butall those wonderfully-erse, one-quarter ethnic minority places could stay at home, go to work, sit in a park, go to the pub, go to mosque, and take the blame for the omnicrapshambles heaposs made of everything, that would be wonderful.Because letaposs be perfectly clear. The infection rate has tripled in the past week in Oxford, the High Peak, and Watford, doubled in Brighton and Tunbridge Wells, increased by a factor of  in the Ribble Valley and Bolsover, and no-one is telling the residents of those places to behave themselves better. Because in Oxford, the worst of these listed, coronavirus is in just .% of the population.Meanwhile, the infection rate in Blackburn with Darwen which is the worst district in the country, is .%. Last week, when lockdown wasnapost necessary, it was .%.We just canapost ignore this evidence, say Matt and his mates, who have all happily ignored calls for an inquiry into why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to catch and die from coronavirus.They also ignore the fact the infection rate in care homes a couple of months ago was %, that they didnapost find it necessary to do much about it, and those same care homes have just been told thereaposll be no more tests for  weeks.Theyaposd much rather you think corona is on the march, and thataposs thanks to the poor, brown people who wonapost stay indoors and definitely not down to the rich, white people who wonapost shut up.

However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced today that face coverings will be compulsory in indoor settings where people are likely to come into contact with others they would not usually meet.This includes cinemas, churches and museums. The guidance currently recommends that face masks are worn in these settings, but it will be made mandatory next week. Brides and grooms at wedding ceremonies will be exempt, but their guests will not. Speaking about the new rules, Mr Johnson said: I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced. That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance. And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law. The announcement came as more planned lockdown easing was scrapped just  hours before more venues were due to reopen. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining beauty parlours will no longer open on August , nationwide. The PM said in a No press conference: “We should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. He added: “Weaposre now seeing a warning light on the dashboard. It is right to respond in the way that we are.” They will have to remain closed for at least another fortnight, Mr Johnson added.Official figures today point to a slight increase in the number of new  coronavirus  cases in England as a whole for the first time since the peak in April. The Office for National Statistics estimates there were around , new cases per day in the community in England in the week to July . That estimate is up from , the week before and , the week before that. Although week-on-week figures canapost be directly compared, the ONS said there is now evidence of a rise.

Today, he dramatically put the breaks on the next round of lockdown easings. Top medical advisor Chris Whitty candidly observed we’re now at the ‘limits’ of what can be opened. It’s not the summer families were expecting. But it is understandable in the circumstances. This week we had official confirmation that England has had the worst death rate in Europe. It is now beyond doubt that earlier this year Boris Johnson was too slow to wake up to the horric consequences of this virus. We’re now seeing infection rates increase across the country. Some countries in Europe are experiencing signicant upticks. The virus is accelerating in parts of the world. Urgent action is necessary. That’s why Labour supports the restrictions that have been put in place. But we need ministers to go further. We need mass testing so everyone can quickly find out their Covid status. And we need an effective system that follows up people who have been in touch with someone who is sick with the virus. Local health workers don’t know who is isolating and can’t check on them. This isn’t the “world beating” system we were promised - yet its costing us £ billion and there still too many holes in our defences. If we are to avoid further widespread lockdowns, the system needs to be up and working. In a pandemic like this, clarity is everything. One of the key lessons of this crisis is that when communication from government become confused or lacks clarity, problems emerge. People lose faith in the public health messaging. This new restrictions were announced just after pm, a few hours before they were due to take effect. The actual guidance people were expected to follow came hours later. People are being asked toto work even though they can’t access childcare or now use extended family outside of their bubble.  Those who work in homes like plumbers and electricians have been left in the dark about whether they are allowed to carry on working or not. And families in a city like Leicester desperate for a holiday still don’t know when the restrictions on ‘non-essential’ travel will be lted. People have made great sacrices. They deserve better.

The over-s - who worked hard all their lives - now deserve a peaceful retirement. Labour in government recognised that. Along with the winter fuel allowance we did things to make le a little easier for those who had given us so much. The Tories have let down older people. And time after time they fail to take responsibility. In attempts to sht the blame for their policy of discharging Covid patients into care homes they hide behind the science. On free TV licences for the elderly - a leline, especially during a public health crisis - they passed the buck. The deal they made with the corporation in  left the Beeb with no choice but to accept the cost of the over-s licence fee or face further cuts. A negotiation by ransom. It is entirely the Governmentaposs doing that the BBC has decided to stop funding it. After a brief reprieve for the pandemic, the benefit is coming to an end with the corporation footing the bill for only the very poorest pensioners. As well as letting the BBC take the blame for their brutal cuts, the Tories have also refused to engage with the corporation to find a solution.

But Health Secretary Matt Hancock issued conflicting information, telling BBC Breakfast viewers: Meeting another household in pub gardens or outdoor restaurant space is not allowed under the new restrictions.Now the official guidance has been updated to confirm Mr Hancock was wrong.It now states: You can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces including outdoor seating or beer gardens in groups of no more than  people, unless the group includes only people from two households. Customers dining or drinking indoors will only be able to sit with people they live with, or members of their support bubble.  Meeting up in private gardens is still banned - and new laws will be passed to enforce it. Police will be able to ask people meeting in private homes and gardens to disperse and issue fixed penalty notices starting at £ - halving to £paid in the first  days – and doubling for repeat offences. Restaurant and bar owners in Manchester say they have been hit by a wave of cancellations  - including for outdoor bookings - as a result of last nightaposs announcement and the subsequent confusion over beer gardens.

Shortly after pm on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that from midnight, people from dferent households in Greater Manchester, parts of Lancashire and parts of Yorkshire were no longer allowed to meet indoors. It means people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households - apart from those in their support bubbles - in private homes or gardens. Some exemptions will be put in place, including for the vulnerable, the government said. They will sign new regulations to make these changes legally enforceable. The regulations will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions. Households may go to hospitality, for instance bars and pubs, but new guidance will make clear that two households should not go to hospitality together. Meanwhile local leaders and government have today agreed a number of changes to local restrictions in other areas. Below are the areas affected by the new restriction... Greater Manchester The rules apply to the whole of Greater Manchester after a number of hotspots were identied. Oldham, Trafford and Manchester were all in the  places with the highest Covid- infection rates. Figures released yesterday showed Oldham had overtaken Leicester, with . cases per , of the population. It was followed by Trafford, with . and Manchester with ..  Parts of East Lancashire It is no secret that Blackburn with Darwen has been cause for concern for some time, with the highest infection rate in England. Yesterday it had . cases per , of the population, and the council had issued fresh guidelines, including a limit on the number of visitors allowed into homes. The new measures go further, however, banning members of two households meeting indoors. Other affected areas are Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale.  Parts of West Yorkshire Three West Yorkshire towns and cities feature in the  worst affected places in England - Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees. Public Health England yesterday said there were . cases per , in the population in Bradford, making it the fourth worst affected area. It was followed by Calderdale in eighth place and Kirklees in tenth. They had rates of . and . per , respectively.  What is happening in Leicester  While social gathering restrictions remain in place in Leicester City, the area will benefit from the lting of restrictions that took place on  July in England, and all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end. It means from Monday  August restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester City can get back to business but leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.  In addition, cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place. And on Saturday  August, Luton will be brought in line with the rest of the country after signicant progress has been made in controlling the virus. Liz Kendall, MP for Leicester West, tweeted: Just been on call with Minister about LeicesterLockdown. The great news is our pubs, cafes, bars  restaurants can re-open and people can go on holiday with their own household.

Fourteen operators shared the huge cash sum between March  and June  as passenger numbers plummeted during the pandemic. Under the Emergency Measures Agreements , the government took on all the risk of operating the railway - but also took on all the revenues, including as passenger numbers pick up. Today it was announced the train firmsapos revenues - and their debts - will now appear on government balance sheets in a major shake-up. The Office for National Statistics concluded operators should be classied to the public sector for statistical purposes due to the emergency measures. The Rail Delivery Group said it was a temporary accounting change while the Department for Transport said private firms will continue to play a vital role”. But TSSA rail union general secretary Manuel Cortes claimed the change meant railways are now in public ownership. He called for Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to come clean and take direct control of running them - rather than continue to line the pockets of fleecing privateers with taxpayersapos money.

Boris Johnsonaposs update to the nations just as millions affected by new local lockdowns in northern England coronavirus hot-spots face were told to follow stricter new rules, and with little notice. Residents of Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were plunged into chaos overnight as new Covid- restrictions were brought in. The ban took effect from midnight with just three hoursapos warning, and prohibit people from meeting other households in all indoor settings, including private homes and gardens. At a press conference this afternoon, the Prime Minister outlined the reason for the new lockdowns, saying he had warned the Government would act aposswtly and decisivelyapos to stamp out local outbreaks - and more areas could follow. He also announced rule changes affecting all of England, declaring face coverings would be compulsory in more indoor settings including cinemas and churches. He postponed reopening of more settings including ice rinks, casinos and bowling alleys for another fortnight, along with wedding receptions of more than  people. He also put off reopening close-contact services - meaning beauty treatments like brows and facials due to restart tomorrow that many Brits will have booked in must be cancelled.  Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned the UK had potentially aposreached the limitapos of how much society could reopen, as infections rise once again. Here are the key changes and rules you need to know about from tomorrow, August . All these venues are able to remain in most of England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Gyms Cinemas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools, lidos and water parks Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos. Face coverings and masks Face masks will be compulsory in more indoor spaces, in one of the biggest changes announced today affecting all of England. The coverings are already mandatory on public transport, unless you have a medical reason or disability that allows you to be exempt from the rules. That includes conditions like asthma, and also people accompanying someone with a condition who needs to be able to lip-read their companion. From August  the new rules will become law, and will required face coverings be worn in indoor settings where it is dficult to practise social distancing - including cinemas, galleries and houses of worship like churches. The PM will ask police to crack down harder on those breaking the rules. Read more about this rule change here.  You can visit cinemas, galleries and museums - but not have a big wedding reception Wedding receptions of more than  people have been banned throughout England with just  hours notice. Rules were set to change from August  in England to allow small, socially-distanced receptions of up to  people. However, the move was one of those postponed for at least two weeks today by Boris Johnson.  Wedding ceremonies of up to  people have already been allowed in England since July  and can continue - including in Greater Manchester, which is among the northern areas facing separate restrictions from today. However, guests must be socially-distanced and the ceremony must follow Covid-secure guidelines.  With face coverings mandatory in places of worship from August  - though itaposs not yet clearthereaposll be exemptions for the bride and groom. The PM also postponed the reopening of more indoor gatherings and businesses that were due to restart tomorrow. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed, he said Indoor performances will not resume - ruling out live music, theatre, and dance, and indoor classes. Larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will also remain off limits Wedding receptions of up to  people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with coronavirus guidelines. You can get a haircut - but you still canapost get your brows done Hairdressers and barbers remain open with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. Nail and beauty salons are now open too. Beauty salons were given the go ahead to re-open on July , just over a week after hairdressers were given the green light. But there remains restrictions on procedures including eyebrow treatments, facials, eye lash tinting and face waxing. More treatments were due to be allowed from tomorrow, August . However the PM today announced the changes due to take effect on Saturday would be postponed at least another fortnight. What you still canapost do anywhere in England:  Large wedding receptions Attend sports matches in a large crowd Big gigs Nightclubs Casino Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Indoor fitness and dance studios Conference centres, other than people who already work thereYou can visit friends and family indoors - but you still canapost hug People in most of England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight - but they still can’t hug. You can also meet in all indoor settings like pubs and restaurants, provided they follow social distancing rules. Indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules and stay over - still havenapost been expanded. Currently bubbles can be formed of two households. One of the bubble households has to have only one adult in it, such as a grandparent living alone, a single parent with kids, or a couple who live apart where at least one lives alone. Your household is allowed to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house, as long as social distancing rules are followed indoors. More on the changes to these rules for northern lockdowns follow below.  Meeting outdoors Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing - and that hasnapost changed for most of England except in the new lockdown areas. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - can also meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. This is guidance. The law only prohibits gatherings of more than  people - except for indoor gatherings in the new lockdown area . You can go to the pub - but you can only meet one other household inside Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens remain open. If youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. More on the changes to these rules for northern lockdowns follow below.  You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses are all reopen to paying guests in England. They must follow coronavirus guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites are reopen too, as long as they have showers and washing-up blocks. Hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet reopen. The government has not said people in northern regions cannot travel. People in the new lockdown zone, such as Greater Manchester, may continue to travel in and out of the new lockdown area, as long as you do not break the rules on meetings indoors.Large wedding receptions Attend sports matches in a large crowd Big gigs Nightclubs Casinos Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Indoor fitness and dance studiosYou canapost send your child to school Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Boris Johnson said today getting kids back to school by September remains a aposnational priority.apos  Shielding people can meet groups of friends outside Shielding was eased for .million vulnerable people in England earlier this morng. Shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end tomorrow. You canapost play cricket, football or rugby, except with your own household Recreation and sport will be allowed. But people should only play close-contact team sports - like football and rugby - with other members of their household. And indoor facilities including changing rooms and courts will remain closed. Cricket is also off limits for now - with Boris Johnson saying the ball is a natural vector of disease.  You can go back to the office or use public transport -your workplace is apossafeapos Guidelines on avoiding public transport unless itaposs absolutely necessary remain. The government has been urging workplaces to begin reopeningthey can follow social distancing guidelines indoors safely. Everyone  should carry on working from homeat all possible. You can travel abroad - with limits You can travel abroad - and aposair bridgesapos mean no quarantine for Brits heading back from summer holidays in some parts of Europe and farther afield. However the limits of the policy have been felt by Spain holidaymakers, after a series of outbreaks sparked the UK government to close the air bridge abruptly. The UK allows travellers coming from a select list of countries to arrive without a -day quarantine period, including Brits ing from holidays from those countries. See which countries remain on the air bridge list here.  Lockdown changes for Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and West Yorkshire New laws are being passed to ban meeting people from other households in private homes or gardens, or travelling in cars together. People can still meet in a public area like a parkthey follow social distancing rules. People will also still be able to visit pubs or restaurants - but only with their own households, and they canapost meet up with others indoors - even in beer gardens. They also wonapost be able to visit care homes. There will be some exceptions, such as for household bubbles. The government shortly after midnight updated guidance saying the government would pass new laws to enforce changes to the new northern lockdowns. While it made clear people will be fined £ for breaking the rules in the localised restrictions, the law to enforce it did not exist at the time the lockdowns kicked in.

In their  manesto the Conservatives pledged that free TV licences for the over s would be retained. But on Saturday this much-loved benefit comes to an end. The Tories are trying to pin the blame on the BBC but the responsibility lies entirely with them. They made a promise and now they are refusing to abide by their word. No wonder so many people feel betrayed. Free TV licences are not a perk. They are a leline for millions of pensioners for whom the telly is a source of companionship and a window into the outside world. The decision is especially cruel when so many older people are having to shield because of coronavirus. A government with a conscience would find the money to enable the BBC to maintain the benefit. In failing to do so this Tory administration has shown it is shameless and heartless. Utter failure Boris Johnson is kidding nobody when he claims his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been a ‘massive success’. The figures from the Office for National Statistics tell the real story – England has the highest number of excess deaths in Europe. An estimated , residents have died in care homes after patients were discharged from hospital without being tested.

And she was sacked when bosses found out - bringing to a sudden end a -year career with the same company.Megan Metcalfe told NottinghamshireLive that she was given her marching orders as her actions were deemed to amount to gross misconduct. Popular Birds Bakery has not been accepting cash for hygiene reasons since reopening following the coronavirus lockdown.They say it is to minimise any risk to staff and customers.  Yesterday, we reported how a -year-old customer was shocked and embarrassed when a Birds branch refused to sell her bread because she only had cash.And today Megan told of how many of the customers at the Birds store where she worked, in Radclfe-on-Trent, are elderly and donapost have a debit card. To make sure they didnapost leave empty-handed, the -year-old of Ruddington decided to ask them to put the money straight into her purse. She would then put the payment through on her card before showing them the receipt. The bakery business said it was with regret that they had to dismiss Megan because of her actions. I realise what I was doing was against company policy. But they had picked up the items and already gotten to the till ready to buy them, Megan said. Thereaposs no way I could let an elderly man or woman walk away telling them they could not buy it because they didnapost have a card. They had also already handled the stock so that would have to be binned or cleaned. Megan says she took around £ of payments in cash and put them through on her card and has kept receipts of the transactions.  She said she was suspended from work for a week with full pay on June  and appeared before a disciplinary hearing the week after before being dismissed from the company. I was just trying to do the right thing. I am really upset by it of course, she added. I worked at Birds for  years and  of them as a manager. I was told I was endangering staff membersapos lives by doing what I did. At no point did money transfer hands. It was straight into my purse and then I put the payment through on card and showed them the receipt. I should not have done it but I donapost like to let people down and a lot of these customers depend on us, coming to us every day. Lesley Bird, chief operating officer at Birds Bakery, said: “At Birds, we take the safety of our staff and customers very seriously – and have very tight procedures in place during this pandemic. A lot of our customer base are the elderly – many of them vulnerable – and it is our responsibility to keep them, and our staff, safe.

David Lake, a former Cambridge University researcher, wore a bizarre carnival-style mask during the attack in which he kicked his victim unconscious before inserting an object into his body. He was ruled to be a danger to the public because he carried out a previous cannibalistic attack in which he chewed flesh off a womanaposs arm and ate it. He posed as a customer at a shop in Exeter in October  before ing with alcohol and offering it to his elderly victim. He plied the shopkeeper with vodka and champagne before putting on the gold mask and suddenly turning violent. He said: I am a black witch. I am not a nice person. Iaposm a black sorcerer and I am f***ing evil.He battered the victim to the ground and kicked him in the back until he passed out from the pain caused by a fractured coccyx.He was sexually assaulted with an unidentied cylindrical object as he lay unconscious. Lake, , of Wellington, Somerset, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, assault by penetration, and criminal damage by a jury at Exeter Crown Court in February. He was jailed for le by Judge David Evans and will not be released unless it is considered safe to do so.He must serve seven and a half years before he can apply for parole. The judge said a le sentence was the only way to protect the public because Lake suffers from an untreatable personality order with grandiose illusions, lacks empathy, and disregards social and sexual norms. He told Lake: The victim thought you were going to kill him. This assault was sadistic and cruelly targeted at a particular part of his body.

The -year-old, from Rochdale, is now dealing with people in Leicester who’ve tested positive for Covid-. A number of changes have been rolled out to the job in recent weeks - including a new measure to track down people who donapost answer calls from the team. Where contact tracers would have previously had four days to try and reach people, that’s been reduced in the outbreak groups.  Atexplains: “If after  hours we can’t make contact with them, we escalate it and a team will go to the household and conduct an interview instead of after  hours. That’s key,” he says. The new methods mean Ataposs vital job now involves so much more than just contact tracing. He went on: “When we call anyone from Leicester, we discuss with them in more detail support we can offer – such as help with food shopping and picking up prescription medication. ‘‘It’s hoped having people to do their essential shopping and pick up prescriptions will increase levels of compliance and make self-isolation easier.” Sarah Hartle , a dental hygienist from Manchester, is another NHS Test and Trace caseworker who has seen her job change to help fight coronavirus.  As pubs, restaurants and shops opened up, she and the team faced new challenges when tracing contacts, so they were given extra training to get the right information from people who’d tested positive for coronavirus. “What’s changed is the questions we’re asking the patients,” she says. “If they were in a shop, were they wearing a mask  Was the shopkeeper  Did they pay by cash or card  Were they maintaining social distancing  If you are doing all those things, the people in that particular shop are not classed as contacts. It’s all based on science. Social distancing does work.” And with the NHS Test and Trace team regularly updated on the latest advice and improvements in the system put in place, they’re able to give people the relevant help they need. She adds: “One recent patient needed a Hindi speaker. The system for that is now so simple and quick, the patient is only on hold for about  seconds and then youaposrere back with the interpreter.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dr miriam stoppard ethnic minorities","story":"NewsopinionDr Miriam Stoppard: Ethnic minorities being failed by lack of inclusive planningThe pandemic has starkly revealed that BAME people are less likely to use Covid- testing services – we need to look at issues from their point of view to find solutionsShareCommentsByMiriam Stoppard:,  JUL NewsopinionTesting kit instructions can be hard to understand for people whose first language is not English \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It’s not just in the UK that ­disparities exist – it’s worldwide. Action is needed to correct this so people from ethnic minorities are included in national and local health planning. Catherine Dodds of Bristol ­University and Ibidun Fakoya from King’s College, London suggest the way forward in an editorial in the BMJ. To keep the R number below one, governments are relying on ­nationwide testing and contact tracing until we have a vaccination programme in place. But while we wait, inequalities mean BAME Covid- infections and deaths keep rising.As Dodds and Fakoya point out we already know uptake of medical testing and screening is uneven across cancer risk assessment, antenatal screening, and HIV testing. The NHS is aiming to expand testing with self-administered swab kits – but this strategy may serve minority groups badly, bearing in mind a  UK study found uptake of HIV self-sampling kits among them was low compared with other groups. Most admitted they would probably not use the kits. Behind this reluctance were privacy issues and kits with complicated instructions that were inappropriately worded for people whose first language wasn’t English. Dodds and Fakoya emphasise until these faults are corrected it’s dficult to see how trust can be built up among our ethnic communities. Isn’t it time we looked at these ­disparities from the BAME point of view, and started framing instructions in a form that’s understandable, acceptable and useful for ethnic minorities instead of imposing a “one-size-fits-all” approach  Given the disproportionate and devastating impact this pandemic has already had among our ethnic minority communities, testing equality needs to be addressed in Covid- screening.

Neo was having a lot of problems with his face and eyes because he had so much saggy skin hanging down and he was in a lot of pain and discomfort. We even had to pull his skin back for him so he could see his meal and eat it properly. It was obvious something had to be done, although we were very worried that he wouldnapost look the same afterwards, especially my daughter Millie, who was a bit tearful over it all. Thankfully, the results have been amazing and made a big dference to Neo, whoaposs recovered very well, and we owe a big thank you to the team at Eastcott. Now itaposs all over, we can finally see the funny side of it and itaposs already led to a few chuckles. When people say to me aposOh isnapost he lovely apos I say aposThataposs because heaposs just recovering from a faceltapos.  No-one believes me when I say the vets removed more than a kilo of skin, they think Iaposm joking, but itaposs absolutely true and Neoaposs all the better for it. Ida Gilbert, an advance practitioner in veterinary ophthalmology , said Neo was considered an urgent case due to his struggles with poor vision, which irritated his eyes, and extremely heavy facial folds. The irritation caused him to rub his eyes repeatedly making them sore, and he became anxious around anyone touching his face, which made using eye drops impossible. Neo struggled to open his eyes due to excessive eyelid , so Ida and the team operated on both eyes and simultaneously completed the facelt to minimise the time he had to be anaesthetised. His eyelid were surgically corrected and shortened by mm as well as having ,g of skin removed.

Emma Murby, , had split up with Timothy Green but he bombarded her with flowers, chocolates and sent her a new vacuum cleaner in a bid to win her back while she was in mourning. The teacher, who lives in the village of Eldwick, near Bingley, West Yorkshire, begged the -year-old company managing director to leave her alone - but he left her scores of messages, a Pandora ring and even posed as one of her friends to send her a condolence card. Police eventually the former golf club boss for harassment. At Stockport magistrates court, Green from Wilmslow, Cheshire who runs a company which provides safety inspections admitted harassment. He was banned from contacting Miss Murby for two years under the terms of a restraining order. The court heard the couple had met online in April  on POF and met in person for the first time at the end of that month. Prosecutor Mark Pritchard said: They then had a long-distance relationship where the defendant was living in Wilmslow and the complainant was living in Eldwick. They spent time together at weekends and sometimes met up in the week. At this point the complainant says it was a normal relationship and that she was happy. In August last year she moved in with him for a short period of time and their relationship became strained.  She moved back and after some time the relationship ended. That is when the defendant began his unrelenting course of harassment towards his victim. On March  this year the victim told police she had broken up with the defendant but he continued to contact her. He continued to send flowers and leave voicemails asking her to call him. She replied saying aposI am blocking your calls and voicemails donapost call me again. Stop harassing me.Leave me alone we are not together any more. Do not contact me anywhere.apos But he left her  messages in March,  in April, seven in May. After the victimaposs father died he sent messages to her reporting to be her friend Nick and sent her a condolence card. On the day of her fatheraposs funeral he messaged her saying he had been in a dark place had continued to send messages and cards after from a number of dferent accounts on Plenty of Fish- which all used the same photograph of him.  On May  he sent a vacuum cleaner part to her address which she believes he did to have a reason to contact her. Between  June and  June this year he contacted a friend of the victim numerous times asking about her. On June  he sent her a Pandora ring which she had owned when they were together with tape attached to it. Green later told police he thought Miss Murby had PTSD and that she was blaming him for it. He said he blamed her for him being on anti-depressants. In mitigation his lawyer Steven McHugh said: He is mortied at the position he is in today. He fears going to prison and is taking things seriously. He is not looking for favours and is realistic. The last point of contact was on  June and he wishes to move on with his le. He does not object to the restraining order. He does not wish to reacquaint himself with the complainant. He did not threaten her when he contacted her and had a mistaken belief that contacting her would resurrect the relationship. He pleaded guilty at he earliest opportunity and accepts there was no provocation at all.

They couldnapost have picked a better week for it, with a heatwave in full swing and temperatures sitting comfortably in the s across the UK. Their holiday is very dferent to the break they took last year, when they spent two weeks in a stunning £,-a-week villa on the private Caribbean island of Mustique. They were joined by George, Charlotte and Louisaposs grandparents Carole and Michael Middleton at the holiday home, which boasts a huge infinity pool and stunning sea views. While they wouldnapost have been able to travel to the island for this yearaposs getaway, they could have picked to visit one of the countries on the UKaposs travel list - but opted for something closer to home. Sources said Kate and William made the decision as they were concerned about the potential need to quarantine when they got back. If they did have self-isolate they wouldnapost have been able to carry out their royal duties - which theyaposve just started again following lockdown - and they werenapost willing to take the risk of missing engagements. Kate and William were seen cycling across the stunning island of Tresco on Thursday. A holidaymaker said: “William and Kate were riding their bicycles, having a laugh. They looked so happy enjoying the weather.“I did do a double take. They were really friendly and said hello.” Scilly has a special place in Williamaposs heart as he went there as a child with brother Harry and his parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana.  William was pictured as a boy visiting Scilly in June  wearing shorts and a red jumper on a bike ride with his family. And rumours spread after their  wedding that he and Kate flew to the destination off the coast of Cornwall.

Deborah Adlam says she has suffered aposendlessapos pain since her son was aposripped from our family while we sleptapos. PC Harper died after he was dragged along for more than a mile by a car filled with quad bike thieves, who he had tried to intercept. The -year-old had only been married for four weeks when he was killed in Berkshire in August last year. His killers Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , were jailed for a total of  years today. All three were cleared of murder by a jury at the Old Bailey last week, prompting PC Harperaposs widow to call for a retrial - something which is very unlikely. In a statement today, his mum said: You have no idea how glad I am the trial has now finished. The results are what they are, and now we have to try and live the rest of our lives without Andrew and instead with a huge heavy weight in our broken hearts. I’m unable to explain the enormity of what I am feeling and struggling with since we were woken on th August  with a knock on the door, .am. “Andrew was gone. Killed in the line of duty... the pain we now live with is endless, Andrew was literally ripped from our family while we slept.  “I had to wake his brother that morning on the th August and tell him his brother was gone. Mrs Adlam said her first born had been ripped from her. The grieving mum described how she misses her son aposwith every passing momentapos. She said he was a good, brave, caring, funny and uplting man who will be loved forever. Mrs Adlam can no longer work for fear of a breakdown, hardly sleeps and struggles to find motivation to complete even basic chores.  She added: I have sat in the mortuary of my sonaposs covered body, too damaged for me to see. He will never get to be called aposdaddyapos or hold his own child - we imagined this was not too far away in the future. “The only thing I know for sure, is no matter what, Andrew will remain our pride and joy and will be loved forever. My heart may be broken but you will always be in the centre of it. My fit healthy happy brilliant son died purely because these boys chose to steal a quad bike. I personally have not seen, heard or felt a glimmer of any remorse.  In fact, we have seen the opposite, with Long, Bowers and Cole repeatedly laughing and showing a complete lack of respect during the court proceedings. PC Harperaposs widow Lissie described being in a lost and endless world after her husband was killed in the line of duty, a month after their wedding day. Lissie broke down twice as she read from her victim impact statement at the Old Bailey. Widow Mrs Harper told the court: This is my third attempt at writing a statement.  I simply find myself in a lost and endless world. Thataposs the reason in particular this question defeats me - unless you have stood in my shoes, lost a soulmate, a beloved partner you intended to spend your le with - how is this grief possible to describe  I have used every word possible to describe this torture - indescribable trauma I have been forced to endure these past  months.

Former businessman Thomas Mee, , along with Vincent Ball,  and John Barlow, , all from Liverpool, targeted homes including in the heart of the north Cheshire stockbroker belt, where house prices soar into the millions. The Cheshire home of Bury FC chairman and owner Steven Dale was broken into in October . Jamiroquai singer Jay Kayaposs house in Buckinghamshire was among those targeted by the gang, as well as the home of Mansfield Town FC owner John Radford. All three defendants admitted conspiracy to burgle homes across the UK, Chester Crown Court heard today. Mee, of Dunnerdale Road, Norris Green, was a well-known businessman in Liverpool. The Mees Group of companies specialised in demolition, asbestos removal and site clearance. Mee is no longer involved with the group. Simon Parry, prosecuting, said: These three defendants are a team of highly organised and sophisticated house burglars who have travelled to ious parts of the UK, including here in Cheshire. He said the three targeted the homes of high-wealth iniduals and used sophisticated techniques such as cloned number plates and dirty phones to avoid detection. The court heard the defendants attempted to burgle Mr Sterlingaposs home in Goostrey, Cheshire, on November , . Simon Parry, prosecuting, said: Fortunately the alarm system at the address activated and scared the burglars away. Nothing was taken. Ten days later, on November  , the three men checked into a hotel in Buckinghamshire and later Mr Kayaposs home, Horsenden Manor, was targeted. Mr Parry said the singeraposs housekeeper noticed an upstairs window was open and found a camera had been stolen. A total of more than £, of jewellery, watches and handbags was taken from  properties across Nottinghamshire, Worcestershire, Buckinghamshire and Warwickshire between November  and October , the court heard. Photos of some of the handbags were found on the phone of Mee, who admitted handling stolen goods. In a statement read to the court, Cheryl Batson, who had £, worth of jewellery and handbags, as well as a Louis Vuitton scarf, taken from her home in Willaston, Cheshire, said she suffered anxiety and distress after the raid.She said: I have a heartbreaking feeling of loss over the sentimental pieces of jewellery which belonged to my late grandmother.I cannot stress enough the heartache I feel over having these items taken from me. On October  , the burglars were disturbed while in the Prestbury home of Mr Dale. Watches worth between £, and £, were dropped by the intruders as Mr Daleaposs son gave chase and they left the property with only a £ note.  They were later arrested and items including balaclavas, binoculars, crow bars and cloned number plates were found in a car used by the men. Officers also found £, in cash during a search of one of Meeaposs properties. Andrew Alty, defending Mee, said it was the defendantaposs case that the money was legitimate. Recorder of Chester Judge Steven Everett branded Mee ignorant and selfish for posting a letter to the home of one of his victims to express his remorse Anthony Russell, whose property in Lymm, Cheshire, was broken into by the gang, said: I only hope this is absolutely genuine but perhaps we would really have preferred not to receive this letter.  Judge Everett adjourned sentencing until Monday. He said: These three defendants need to appreciate the effect of their awful actions on all of these people. Mee, who has been involved in demolition since , was very well connected and worked with some of the biggest developers in the region. In , he gave an interview to the Daily Post, when he discussed his successful business career. He told how he started his own company in  and was on target to turn over around £m.  He said: My bank told me it normally takes someone up to six years to get to where we are today. In more recent years, Mee supervised major site clearance schemes in the city. He was a director of Mees Demolition Group and Mees Demolition Manchester Limited. Mee does not appear to have had any further business dealings since he resigned from Mee Demolition Manchester in August last year. In , he spoke to the media after taking on the demolition of the famous Nation nightclub - formerly Cream - in Liverpoolaposs Wolstenholme Square. He said: “We know that all eyes will be on the redevelopment of this iconic Liverpool square.

It has become the third hottest UK day on record, with a sweltering .C recorded at Heathrow Airport.Sun-seekers were pictured piling onto beaches, including Bournemouth and Brighton, to make the most of the mini heatwave. But as lockdown easing measures were put on hold and the government urging people to maintain social distancing, police were patrolling beaches to ensure rules were being stuck to. Parts of the UK are expected to be hotter than Ibiza as the  mile-wide Spanish Plume brings continental heat. But Public Health England’s Heatwave Plan warned there could be travel disruption for Brits heading for the coast. And there is the possibility of thunderstorms later in the evening.  The Met Office has revealed that the mercury has hit .C making it the hottest day of the year by some way. The organisation said: It has now reached . °C at Heathrow and . °C at Kew Gardens, making it the hottest day of the year by some way. Public Health Englandaposs weather advice says: “At C, tarmac roads may begin to melt.” Roasting temperatures are predicted in much of England, with the hottest temperatures of C predicted in London and the South East. Bournemouth is bracing to be slammed by tourists once again after the beach was swamped on the .C hottest day of the year on June . Major incidents had to be declared at beaches including the popular Dorset beauty spot during Juneaposs heatwave, as sunbathers amassed huge crowds in breach of social distancing guidelines. Tesco predicted selling a BBQ and beer rush, with projected sales of almost a million sausages, half a million burgers and five million bottles and cans of beer. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Itaposs a Fab Friday for most – but watch out for thunderstorms later in the South and East in particular.” Another Met Office forecaster said: “Thundery showers are possible later on Friday. “It will be a much cooler weekend though, with temperatures C or more lower on Saturday, with some rain moving from the west later on Sunday to across the South on Monday.” The UK average temperature for this July is currently on course to be just .C, one degree less than the - long-term average of .C, data from the Met shows.

Officers spent two days digging up the foundations of the Christian Brueckneraposs former rented shack - removing concrete rubble from the remains. Diggers, snfer dogs, ground penetrating radar and drones were used to examine the site near Hanover where he stayed after Madeleine vanished. When they left on Wednesday evening, they refused to saythey had discovered anything on the site. But it is believed they lted a stone slab to find an underground cellar full of corrugated iron which a snfer dog reacted to and started barking. The allotment, used as a country escape for city dwellers, was reduced to a patch of sand after the search team left.  There is one old sign left nailed onto one tree trunk at the site entrance warning parents they are aposliable for their childrenaposthey trespass. Brueckner, aged , was said to have stockpiled insulation in the shabby grey shack, which had been demolished before the search took place. The next door neighbour said the allotment lease holder had allowed him to stay there in  after meeting him at a festival and hearing he was homeless. But he was kicked off after falling out with neighbours about a year later.But his lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher calls the search of the site a pure desperate act of the public prosecutoraposs office. This week locals urged police to search a second site an hour away in Braunschweig but his lawyer said “They wonapost find anything there either”. And he ridiculed the public prosecutoraposs office by saying: “Apparently, itaposs hard for investigators to admit they backed the wrong horse. At the start of the search the convicted rapist, who is serving a jail sentence for drug offences, said he was withdrawing his request for an early release.  His full sentence is due to finish in Janaury next year but he is still facing sentence for the rape of a  year old woman in Potugal. But as soon as officers left his allotment site his lawyer revealed he was again applying for early release. The news puts further pressure on police to find evidence which could keep him behind bars. It is believed they have evidence he was in Praia da Luz in Portugal on the night Madeleine went missing in  and that he received a  minute phone call from the area.

The brave pooch Emma Roo was rescued in  from a butchers in Xi’an, China, but not before she had her front legs, part of her tail and the tips of her ears cut away.  She was only about eight weeks old at the time, rescuers believe, and may have been given to meat traders because of a small toe defect. Most of the animals killed for the meat trade in China are stolen or abandoned pets or guard dogs, as well as stray street dogs snatched from towns and cities. Slaughterhouses in the dog meat industry remove an animal’s limbs without any pain relief as they believe it produces adrenaline, which tenderises the remaining meat. After being rescued and taken to a veterinary practice in Bejing, Emma was rehomed for two years, before winding up back at the same clinic in .  The Chinese clinic then turned to Dalmatian Rescue, a US non-profit organisation, in their quest to get Emma a loving forever home. Lelong Dog lover Misha Rackclf Hunt, ,  from Charleston, South Carolina spotted Emma online and fell in love immediately.  I remember first seeing Emma online - she has the most human-like amber coloured eyes. I didnapost even think about the logistics of it. I knew this dog was set to me for a reason. When I met her, I thought she might be cold or not interested in people from the trauma but she came up straight into my arms. By the time we finished our five-hour road trip home, itaposs like she knew I was her person and that I was never going to leave her.  Misha took the dog in - who is now as playful and loving as any other pet. She said: “Eventually, Emma arrived in the US on January ,  – just weeks before the export of animals was banned due to Covid-. “When I first brought her home, she would scream at the top of her lungs whenever I left the room. She was always protective over her food and toys. At one point, she would even guard random pieces of my clothing because she was scared that it would be taken away.”Now safe in the US, Emma has attracted , Instagram fans, with Misha and Dalmatian Rescue raising funds through social media to get Emma a custom front wheel cart from Eddieaposs Wheels and to raise awareness about the cruel trade in dog meat worldwide."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.42844087-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.42844087-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.42844087-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.42844087-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"analysis dundee have right to feel aggrieved","story":"The   Championship season will kick off with a bang as Dundee head to fellow-promotion contenders Hearts for a mouth-watering opening day clash at Tynecastle.James McPake’s Dark Blues are expected to go head-to-head with Robbie Neilson’s Jambos in the race to the Premiership this coming season and will have the chance to lay down a marker straight away.Kicking off on the weekend of October , this season’s second tier will be a shorter affair than usual with only  matches and teams facing each other just three times.That means it’s the luck of the draw for home advantage in key games.And it’s fair to say Dundee’s luck hasn’t been in.As well as playing relegated Hearts away twice, the Dark Blues face two trips to last season’s runners-up Inverness and visit fourth-placed Ayr United twice, teams expected to be in the mix once again.On top of that there are two away games on the plastic parks of both Alloa and Queen of the South – the first of those on Boxing Day before the Dee end their campaign at Palmerston on April .With an odd number of games, half the teams would also miss out on one home game and, once more, lady luck hasn’t shined on the Dark Blues with  home matches and  away.With money tight at the club due to the coronavirus shutdown, Dundee have the right to feel aggrieved they will have to go with one less home game than others as well as only having one big pay day from a sizeable Hearts travelling support.That is, providing fans will be allowed inside the stadiums by that point.On paper, James McPake and his men have been handed a dficult Championship calendar but it’s also one with opportunity.The opening day Hearts clash will kick off the campaign with one of the biggest games of the season. However, it’s also a chance to lay down a marker.Grab a positive result there and the Dark Blues head into two home games on the bounce with Morton and newly-promoted Raith Rovers coming to town before the end of October – an opportunity to get off to a flying start.On the back of a trip to face Ayr, Dundee play Dick Campbell’s Arbroath at Dens before a Highlands clash with Inverness and then facing a Dunfermline side that has strengthened well over the past few weeks.After a Boxing Day trip to Dumfries, it’s the only midweek fixture of the campaign – home to Alloa – four days before hosting Hearts in what’s likely to be one of the biggest matches of the calendar for the Dens men.With only  of the  matches before the turn of the year, getting  off to a strong start will be essential to any promotion bid.That’s where the fixture list looks to be in Dundee’s favour – successive home games against the Jambos, Ayr and Inverness with trips to Raith and Arbroath in between.That run from the start of the year through to March’sto Tynecastle will be the key to success for James McPake and his men before heading into the final eight matches.The Dark Blues won’t be too happy with the card they’ve been dealt by the SPFL but defiance in the face of adversity is a trait at Dens Park.And come the final day on a Friday night at Queen of the South, the players will still fancy they can finish up on top and get the club back to the big time – eventhey have to do it the hard way.A full fixture list can be found here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was lucky enough to play under Ivanin  but I’d lost three before we’d managed to get one.“Jim was manager for a few before then as well so that was probably big thing for him, not being able to do the clean sweep of Scottish football.“Aberdeen were the benchmark, with the New Firm at the time, the two of us were competing against one another.“Them having won European titles probably was sore for him, especially having gone so close.“You look at Roma and then Gothenburg it was, obviously, a big thing for him.”Bowman, who would go on to make  appearances for the club, checked in at Tannadice in  and was part of United’s efforts to make the Uefa Cup showpiece that season.They, arguably, could go down in history as the club’s greatest-ever side.However, the former Hearts man was quick to hail McLean’s title-winning side of  as the best of all.“I would still say when they won the league in  was their best team, what an achievement that was for the club,” he added.“But he kept on evolving the team by bringing myself, Jim McInally and Iain Ferguson to the club in .“When I look back at my time, the players I played with were absolutely brilliant.“They were top professionals as well with the way they conducted themselves off the park. That’s probably why they got so much success.“The likes of Heggie , Davey , Eamonn , Luggy , Holtyand Maurice , they were all great.“For Jimmy Mac, Fergie and I to come into that, playing with them week-in, week-out, it certainly makes your football a lot easier to do.”Bowman looks back on their European adventures with great fondness, hailing the Arabs as some of the best supporters on the continent.“When you look back at the  Uefa Cup run and we were playing Lens in the first round, there wasn’t loads of press and fans but the hype grew as we went on,” he continued.“As we went through the rounds you could see it building.“The fans were brilliant. They’d travel everywhere – the crowds for Barcelona, Monchengladbach and Gothenburg in the final were exceptional.“People even came to Romania to see us play Craiova, it was an Iron Curtain country at the time so that was dficult for their visas and getting there.“It just shows you exactly what United fans were and are still about.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretKqynNAaff\" data-secret\"KqynNAaff\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet.

believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd

where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set.

But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-best-gardens-visit-summer","story":"Still short of things to do during summer holidays  Why not visit some of our most glorious gardens, which have reopened to the public.They all detail the Covid- safety measures theyve put in place on their websites.

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines. Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid. Mr Major himself threatened to take Boris Johnson to court for proroguing parliament.Tony Blair has fast become the past premier most likely to pop up with ldquohelpful advice, as he showed on Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday.With the BBC Sunday programmes now on their summer hols, presenter Sophy Ridge made the most of being the only show in town, breezing straight in on the dayrsquos big story ndash the sudden imposition of a fortnightrsquos quarantine for holidaymakers ing from Spain.

On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The film has been more-or-less finished for almost a year, but like many films such as the latest Bond, it has been pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. Originally scheduled for July , the film has been delayed three times and even briefly taken off the roster entirely, triggering worried chatter from film fans.But now itrsquos finally coming out The filmrsquos producersrsquo Warner Bros. have announced Tenet will be releasing in  countries, a list that notably includes South Korea, Germany and the UK, but not the United States. The odds are in favour of the film debuting in Scotlandrsquos cinemas on August  as the producers have likely already lost signicant sums due to repeated postponements.Whatrsquos it all about Under Nolanrsquos all-seeing-eye, the cast and crew have taken a vow of silence on the inner workings of the film. Piecing together clues from trailers and marketing packages, the basic outline of the film appears to centre around the protagonist, played by John David Washington , who works for a shady organisation called Tenet. Washington is tasked with preventing global catastrophe by securing a device that seems able to reverse the flow of time: for example, the trailer features a car crash occurring in reverse, and a building littered in bullet holes from a shoot-out that hasnrsquot yet occurred. For those familiar with Nolanrsquos work, time-meddling will come as no surprise.Time-meddling  Can you be more specic Nolan is famous for fiddling with the flow of time in unconventional ways in many of his movies. Interstellar uses Einsteinrsquos theory of Relativity to show Matthew McConaugheyrsquos character, aboard a super-fast spaceship, experience a slower rate of time than his family back home on Earth, as McConaughey is tragically forced to watch decades pass for his family within the space of a few hours.Inception is infamously indecipherable due to its complicated concept of lsquodreams within dreamsrsquo, where the flow of time slows throughout each new lsquolayerrsquo of dreams. His early work, Memento, throws the concept of watchability almost out the window with the scenes arranged lsquoback-to-frontrsquo and the plot occurring in reverse.So itrsquos going to be totally incomprehensible then Probably not. Most of Nolanrsquos blockbusters are very accessible such as his last big release, Dunkirk, or his acclaimed Dark Knight Batman trilogy. Though his films sometimes contain confusing concepts, they are still an enjoyable experience, especially in the distraction-free cinema environment.Is it worth going to see then If you enjoy Nolanrsquos previous work or the action or thriller genres, itrsquos the film for you. And of course, the film features the biggest and best of Hollywoodrsquos blockbuster glitz, glamour, soundtrack and special effects.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

with schools the new frontline.Earlier this week Mr Weir said theof pupils for the new term is possible, even though it is only weeks away.He has been facing growing pressure to set out a comprehensive plan detailing how a safeto classrooms can be achieved.However, the department has admitted that issues have arisen over funding.A spokesperson said: The Department and the Education Authority have worked together to quanty the anticipated costs to facilitate the reopening of schools, which includes PPE.As there is insufficient funding within the education budget to address the quantum of pressures identied, additional funding would need to be agreed by the Executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEducation Minister Peter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEducation Minister Peter WeirMr Weir plans to bring a paper to the Executive to get agreement on the issue soon, however, it is likely that other departments will be bidding for funding too.Mr McCamphill said that their members are very concerned by the lack of clarity on the situation as well as the lack of funding for schools.He said: They#re also very concerned that Peter Weir seems to be disregarding his own guidance that he published on June , which set out the plan for how schools should reopen in August and September.When that guidance was introduced in June, the incidence rate was fairly low, we had hoped that would continue to fall and maybewe were lucky it wouldn#t be needed.But that#s not the case, we have signicantly more cases now than we had in June, therefore the Minister shouldn#t be moving to substantially change the guidance that was drawn up.We clearly think the Minister of Education seems to operate under the illusion that schools are some sort of magical places where coronavirus can#t be transmitted and he needs to take this seriously and ensure that teachers, other workers and pupils are fully protected when schools reopen.The guidance says that schools must do this, must provide the sanitation etc, but without providing money they are leaving schools in a very dficult position and schools are being left to decide how much to have in relation to PPE and sanitising equipment.But our view is that schools need to be allocated funding and there is a model for doing this - in the Republic they have applied a formula based on the number of pupils in every school that schools will be provided extra funding so that they can then purchase hand sanitiser and protective equipment.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseChief Medical Officer Michael McBride FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappChief Medical Officer Michael McBrideStormont ministers are being advised by Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride and Chief Scientic Advisor Professor Ian Young, who both said this week that there would be some benefit to pupils wearing masks at school.Mr McCamphill added: I think it would be rather bizarreyoung people had to have masks in their pockets so that they could get on the school bus or go into a shop on the way home, but then wouldn#t be allowed to wear the same mask in school.Butwe want to educate the populace and young people to wear masks, education like with other le skills needs to be developed in school, so we need to model that practice of wearing masks in school.There is guidance but again, no money to back up that guidance, and that is what has got principals and teachers most frustrated, they#ve been told what to do but haven#t been given the money to do it.Time absolutely is of the essence.While there will be a phased ,we are to build up to a full ,that#s possible, we#re going to have to make sure that all the correct health and safety measures are taken, otherwise this will all blow up and everyone will be off again.It is the wider population we want to protect, many of those young people will be going home to parents and grandparents who are in the vulnerable categories.We are calling on the Minister to think again about bringing proposals to the Executive for full reopening.The Minister needs to continue to work with trade unions on implementing the guidance that was put in place in June and ensuring that schools receive adequate funding to ensure the measures can be put in place to protect pupils and staff as well as the wider community.

I write articles. I#ve been a columnist for The Sun, columnist for the Daily Mirror.Previous register entries, dating back to , revealed Mr Paisley was paid between £ and £ for a number of articles he had written for The Sun.He added: I write articles from time to time. I think even the Belfasthave paid me for articles. The Catholic Herald is a newspaper, they pay a fee to anyone who contributes to it.In the Catholic Herald article, the North Antrim MP explained that his admiration of Catholics stems from the fact they are unashamed about the fact the Christian denomination promotes devotion and values family, children and le.He also admitted his comments may raise eyebrows coming from the son of the late Ian Paisley, one of the founders of the DUP.However, despite public perceptions of his father, Mr Paisley says that his upbringing as the son of a pastor meant that people of all backgrounds, all faiths and none were welcomed into the family home.Very often, it was a Roman Catholic visitor who wanted a prayer said for them and their situation, he continues.In the article, he also stresses that he shares identical beliefs to pro-le Catholics. What strikes me most is that they are unashamed and are never embarrassed about having a faith that promotes devotion and values family, children and le, he writes. These values are identical to my own beliefs. Whilst my faith may not require me to light a candle for a bereaved loved one or friend, I wouldn#t dismiss lightly that kind of public display or token of concern and thought. Even Christians can sometimes be too stf-upper-lipped to express emotion.He also described himself as a long-time campaigner for the protection of the rights of the unborn.Mr Paisley said it was without doubt the strongest support he has received - both publicly and privately - has been from his Catholic constituents.They are quite happy to tell me that they disagree with many aspects of my politics, he admits. But they say that#s easily put aside when they know I#m fighting faithfully on this matter. To hear them say this - either privately in whispers or more publicly - brings a wave of real encouragement and a sense that I am doing the right thing.He revealed that within his own constituency he had received support from Catholics for his stance on the abortion issue.Just in the last six months, I#ve received over  letters and emails from constituents who are Roman Catholic offering support on this one issue. That cannot be overvalued, he wrote.The MP added that he also has the support of anti-abortion campaigner Bernie Smyth, from Precious Le.He revealed that he was left moved when she signed his Westminster nomination papers on the basis of my pro-le credentials, adding the gesture was more meaningful as she was publicly happy to nail her colours to the mast.

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

On a positive note, the Kevin Watson Group moved into a building on the site in February.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Woods managed the Wolfhounds to success in  and is joined in the management team by Sean Forrest and former Derry player Karl Diamond. They will have to plan without Ruairi Hassan as his suspension from a sending off against Doire Trasna last season carries over. Woods was happy with preparations earlier in the season, the first time all the players were available with university commitments all behind them. googletag.cmd.push Aside from Conor Boyd , Richard Kingis the next oldest player ahead of the raft of young players who Woods feels are beginning to make GAA their priority. David Brolly is the latest to put his shoulder to the wheel and will be pushing for a start. That said, Woods admits he has a concern that the season could be ended in the blink of an eye with the ongoing situation surrounding Covid across the country. Adrian McGilligan is joined in the Glack management team by Willie Canning and former Doire Colmcille boss Simon Doherty. McGilligan feels the championship is somewhat of a lottery with the lack of preparation and player welfare needs to come first. googletag.cmd.push Back in the fold this year is Tommy OKane who s from a knee injury. After their attractive brand of football last year saw them romp to the junior title, this season has been dferent with football stopped in its tracks. Glack have concerns around Ciaran Carmichael, Cormac Boyle and talisman Niall McGowan ahead of the weekend. There was little between the sides in the last two championship meetings, which were both won by Limavady. It is a derby game and with both teams outside the favourites for the title, the local bragging rights will be at stake and Limavady should come through.

Brian Henry and Kevin Mullan are vying for the number one jersey. Ruairi Henry, Caolan Diamond, Connor Mullan, Martin and Patrick McPeake have experience in recent seasons. One thing Cassidy has noticed has been the improvement of Niall Loughlin who has bulked up and has led their attack in recent challenge games. Enda Lynn has played in pre-season, but needed a further check-up and Cassidy, who has Eglish man Sean Murtagh in as trainer, might keep him for the second or third group game with the view to the knockout stages. googletag.cmd.push Kevin McCann is back in the fold to add extra experience but with work commitments Dodger has had to maximise training time at the weekends. These two clubs were almost inseparable over a decade ago, with Greenlough beating the Quigan in the  final, before the result was reversed a year later. Ballymaguigan are managed this year by Colin Letters who captained them to a league and championship double in , before spending eight years in America. He has inherited a team in transition. From the team which lost the  final to Banagher, Ballymaguigan have lost a wealth of talent. Former player manager Darren Conway has retired and Ciaran Papa McIvor is still on board, but is playing bits and pieces. Ryan Ferris has also transferred back to Magherafelt. googletag.cmd.push Andrew McCartney has joined his management team, alongside Paul Donnelly. Playmaker Sean Brady wont be available while he waits for an operation on a hand injury. Also in attack, a hip injury – which requires an operation – will rule out accurate free-taker Daniel Bradley. It will leave Michael Spiers, Fergal Johnston and Tomaacutes Brady as important players for them. They couldnt have been handed a tougher draw and Greenlough should pick up an early win.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI.

Last weekend, Devines  European Rally Championship campaign got off to a frustrating start with an early retirement from Rally di Roma Capitale. Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy had shown promise early on with eighth fastest time in Friday qualying as well as being the quickest Hyundai i R, outpacing works Hyundai driver Craig Breen and fellow Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Junior Driver Greacutegoire Munster. On Saturday morning, Devine was running on the fringes of the top  and despite not being fully committed to his pacenotes, was outpacing Hyundai Rally Team Italia driver, and former Italian Champion, Umberto Scandola. googletag.cmd.push “We were slightly disappointed with our start and knew we had much more in us”, said Callum after the event. “We were just starting to get into a flow on stage three and building up speed. To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last weekend, Devines  European Rally Championship campaign got off to a frustrating start with an early retirement from Rally di Roma Capitale. Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy had shown promise early on with eighth fastest time in Friday qualying as well as being the quickest Hyundai i R, outpacing works Hyundai driver Craig Breen and fellow Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Junior Driver Greacutegoire Munster. On Saturday morning, Devine was running on the fringes of the top  and despite not being fully committed to his pacenotes, was outpacing Hyundai Rally Team Italia driver, and former Italian Champion, Umberto Scandola. googletag.cmd.push “We were slightly disappointed with our start and knew we had much more in us”, said Callum after the event. “We were just starting to get into a flow on stage three and building up speed. To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9633040.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At five miles long, it is a fraction of the proposed -mile NI-Scotland bridge but there are such bridges, including Hong Kong-Zhuhai-MacauBack in  the notion of a bridge was used as satire to lampoon then Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger over the failure of the Union Bill. Pitt, of course, had the last laugh with the passage into law the following year of the Act of Union.Almost a century passed before formal plans for such bridges came into being.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Shane Greer, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, investor and political commentator, is originally from Northern Ireland, now living in Washington DC. © Jessica YurinkoAt least five dferent potential routes have been proposed, debated, rejected, or otherwise left to wither on the vine since then. But just as technological progress advances endlessly to make the once fantastical seem achievable, so too do the impediments to such a bridge recede in the face of that progress.Nevertheless, mockery of the very idea of a physical transport connection between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is indulged with every bit as much enthusiasm as those anti-Union publishers who set their sights on Pitt. And like those publishers, their modern-day contemporaries remind us that the act of mocking is much easier than the act of manesting that which they mock. In Pitt’s case, the Union, in our case a bridge. Yes, there are impediments. Some even verge on the comical, like reckoning with the million-plus tonnes of conventional and chemical weapons dumped in a submarine trench, Beaufort’s Dyke, last century. One can almost imagine the originator of the weapons dumping scheme having one final meeting in a windowless Whitehall conference room before giving the green light. “Anyone foresee any potential problems with dumping all these munitions in the Irish Sea  Jenkins ” “None sir. Seems like a spfing idea.”But let’s dispense with easy mockery and instead engage in thoughtful discussion. First, those with expertise in this area, like Wanda Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Warwick, do not see even such issues as the presence of wartime munitions in Beaufort’s Dyke as a factor rendering a bridge impossible. She contends that it’s more a question of whether the cost of crossing the Dyke would render other bridge routes more cost-effective. In other words, yes there are signicant challenges, but we have the capability and the capacity to study them, work out the cost of overcoming them, and reach evidence-based decisions on viability.Second, we need only look around us to witness marvels of infrastructure that stand as a testament to our remarkable ability to overcome astonishing engineering challenges. Relatively close to home, there’s the Öresund Bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark. Proposals for a tunnel or bridge crossing the Öresund strait date back almost as far as those for a bridge between Great Britain and Ireland. Twenty years on from Öresund’s completion, we are reminded of our capacity to surmount the once insurmountable.Before anyone retorts that the Öresund Bridge spans a mere fraction of the distance the Irish Sea bridge would be required to cross, I would direct their attention to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which at around  miles is about the distance as the crow flies between Belfast and Cookstown. Distance, like depth and other environmental conditions, are just challenges to be met and overcome.Thirdly, let us remember how transformative it is to be able to get easily from one place to another. Just as it is easy to forget how the ready availability of light at the flick of a switch has transformed human le, so too do we forget how dferent our lives would be without the M, A, or the Ballywhatever Road you take to get the groceries, visit family or commute to work. Gray and black roads like these are the arteries through which our lives flow. Casting all  aside, just consider how remarkable it would be to get into your car and drive to Glasgow, Manchester or London.Fourthly, and perhaps most important of all, we need to dispense with that most tiresome of character traits, the desire to shoot others down and shoot their ideas down. Seats in the peanut gallery are cheap, but they add nothing but distraction to actual events being played out on the stage. It is a tiresome trait that holds Northern Ireland back in so many ways. The notion that that will never work, that engaging in a new venture is too risky, that things are the way they are for a reason, that you should not rock the boat, are not worthy of a people whose capacity to overcome adversity is legend. So let’s dispense with the lazy criticism and support a proper feasibility study. Let facts lead the decision-making process, not untested aspersions. None of this is to say that a bridge to Scotland is an infrastructure proposal of singular importance. As Ben Lowry pointed on these pages last week ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure,’ see link below,a bridge is to be built it will be decades before the first vehicle travels across it. Instead, it must be viewed as one substantial piece of a much more ambitious project to improve connectivity within and without Northern Ireland. With that in mind, and as Robert Park argued here yesterday ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world,’ see link below, a bridge shouldn’t be thought of as a “‘unionist umbilical’ project,” but as part of a “massive, strategic investment that willsecurity to us on energy, connectivity, water and jobs.”As a people who have spent decades now building metaphorical bridges between erstwhile detached communities in Northern Ireland, we can do better than trying without empirical merit to prevent the construction of physical ones. • Shane Greer is an entrepreneur, investor and political commentator based in Washington DC• Ben Lowry: ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure’• Robert Park: ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Manwho died suddenly on Sunday was father of a little girl‘He wore his great big heart openly on his sleeve’ mourners told at funeral of ‘legend’ Gary McConaghyNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
