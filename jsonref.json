We believe what we are doing will have a very positive impact on the political situation.”Meanwhile, Max Verstappen is blaming his substandard qualifying display on his tyres. “Q1 and Q2, everything felt normal, felt good but then I don’t know, my first set in Q3 was terrible,” he said. “I had no grip and honestly, I don’t understand because there was not really anything weird going on.”Red Bull’s all-new RB18 car certainly sounds impressive. Last week, though, we got a faintly hilarious reminder of an F1 car’s most fundamental requirement: to cross the finish line. It was a test failed in slapstick style by a $140m team whose high-spec cars both chuntered to a stop as the race was reaching its business end – proof that the best sporting drama comes with a healthy dose of schadenfreude.  If the boffins in Red Bull’s garage have come up with a fix in the intervening week, then we can expect a rip-roaring battle between them and Ferrari today, after Sergio Perez claimed the first pole of his 215-race career with an impeccable display in Q3. He was two-hundredths up on Charles Leclerc – who proved his title credentials with victory last week after a thrilling scrap with Max Verstappen – while Carlos Sainz scooted into third. Ferrari’s supremely impressive one-two in Bahrain gives every impression that their decision to write off last season in order to develop this year’s car is a gamble that could pay off lavishly.  Ahead of the curtain-raiser in Bahrain, the big questions concerned Mercedes, whose new car was beset by engineering problems and whose drivers were getting grouchy. And despite the surprise late podium for Lewis Hamilton, those issues haven’t gone away: Hamilton suffered a rare exit in qualifying yesterday, his car still beset by the porpoising problems that plagued pre-season. “It’s a long, long way back,” he grumbled afterwards. “I am looking forward to going home.”  This week, though, the truly big question is whether this should be happening at all. This Grand Prix is hosted in a state accused by Human Rights Watch of a “brutal crackdown on peaceful dissidents”, where same-sex relations are illegal, and at a circuit 10 miles from a site that was attacked by missiles on Friday afternoon. “This weekend’s Grand Prix in Saudi Arabia is sportswashing – plain and simple,” said Felix Jakens of Amnesty International this week.

Photograph: iStockThe highly transmissible BA.2 variant of Covid-19 accounts for almost 95 per cent of virus infections in Ireland, latest figures show.The spread of BA.2 infections to the near-exclusion of other variants has coincided with the rise in cases in the latest wave of the pandemic, data provided by the Department of Health shows.BA.2 accounted for just 4 per cent of cases in the third week of January, when most Covid-19 restrictions were lifted by the Government. By the end of February, when the remaining restrictions were removed, it accounted for 76 per cent of cases.Since then, its dominance has become even more pronounced in mid-March it accounted for 90.6 per cent of cases and on March 20th, the most recent day for which data is available, 94 per cent. Over this period, Ireland has experienced a sixth wave of cases, driven by the lifting of restrictions and the spread of BA.2.The Department’s figures are estimates, culled from the results of PCR tests. BA.2 cases test positive for three gene targets whereas other Omicron sub-lineages - the originally dominant BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.3 - test negative for one of the targets.Although the Delta variant, which was dominant here late last year, also tests positive for the three targets it is no longer found here. As a result, a PCR test with a positive S gene target along with two other positive targets is “highly likely” to be infected with BA.2, according to the Department.Genomic sequencing is required to confirm the presence of BA.2 but this is carried out in under 5 per cent of cases. In addition, sequencing takes a number of weeks to complete, so up to date figures are not available.However, the results of sequencing carried out by the National Virus Reference Laboratory shows a similar trend of BA.2 ascendancy. In the first week of the year, just one BA.2 case was identified out of 1,978 cases sequenced. By the end of February, the subvariant accounted for 112 cases out of 175 sequenced (64 per cent).The number of Delta variant cases that were sequenced fell from 73 in the first week of 2022 to one in the third week of February and none the following week.British authorities last week suggested a “recombinant” strain of Covid-19 involving a mix of BA.1 and BA.2 is growing 10 per cent faster than BA.2. Two recombinants that mix Delta and BA.1 are also being monitored one, first identified in Cyprus and France, has been given the nickname “deltacron”.Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency has authorised Evusheld, a combination of the two long acting antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab, for Covid-19 prevention.The treatment, which can be administered in a GP surgery or in the community rather than being given intravenously in hospital, is expected to be used to protect immunocompromised patients.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":" checks for non irish entering ni says brandon lewis","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis met under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin. Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph:  Christopher FurlongGettyThe mayors of Manchester and Liverpool will seek a post-Brexit “resetting” of ties with Ireland as they begin a two-day trip to Dublin on Monday.The visit by Labour mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram comes at a time of poor relations between Ireland and Britain amid the ongoing EU-UK dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.Speaking to The  ahead of the trip, they sought to draw a distinction between their cities in the northwest of England – which have strong social and economic connections to Ireland – and the UK government led by Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.Mr Burnham said: “When people in Westminster speak, they don’t always speak for us. I can imagine how in Ireland some people might think that they do, or they might think, ‘What’s happened to the northwest, has it changed?’“Obviously, we’re coming over to say that we haven’t changed. We don’t want to see some of the nonsense in national politics disrupt our relationship with Ireland.”The pair are to meet President Michael D Higgins and, virtually, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar among other engagements, before they spend a third day in Belfast.They will be joined by 15 businesses and former Ireland and Manchester United footballer Denis Irwin, who will act as ambassador during the visit.Central Statistics Office figures show that Ireland’s imports from Britain fell by 13 per cent in 2021 – the first year of new checks on British goods post-Brexit – compared to 2020.‘Most important trading partner’Mr Burnham said that before the pandemic, Ireland was “up there with Germany” as Manchester’s “most important trading partner” in the EU. He said he wants to keep that tradition going, and pointed to new opportunities in the tech sector. Mr Rotheram highlighted the “green industrial revolution” and offshore wind power as an area of potential collaboration.There will also be a meeting with the mayors of Dublin and Belfast to sign a memorandum on co-operation in harnessing green energy from the Irish Sea.Both politicians are directly elected mayors whose visit to Ireland comes ahead of a Citizens’ Assembly that will soon be debating the merits of bringing in a directly elected mayor for Dublin.There are already plans for Limerick to have a directly elected mayor after the people there voted in favour of the idea in 2019.Mr Burnham said having directly elected mayors in Manchester and Liverpool had given both cities a “louder voice” than they previously had in a “very London-centric country”.He has powers in the areas of transport and housing but wants more control over both areas. According to Mr Burnham the UK was late to having directly elected mayors, but that Ireland is “probably an outlier” in not having such roles.Mr Rotheram said he would like more flexibility over how money provided by central government could be spent in the Liverpool region.Having a directly elected mayor, he added, allows a city to “get a bigger bang for our buck” as they can be more “responsive” and “nimble” than what “a national monolith, a great big machine, can do on our behalf”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"liz truss right now differences eu seem lot smaller","story":"She is Foreign Secretary at the time of a war in Europe, Iran on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and the UK charting its own course after 47 years of EU membership. It is, perhaps, therefore not unreasonable that Liz Truss has concluded that now is the busiest time for foreign policy since the 1980s. It also becomes quickly apparent that her experience of one seismic task is influencing her approach to another. While reiterating her determination to “fix” the Northern Ireland Protocol agreed as part of the UK’s exit deal with the EU, Ms Truss stated: “There is a difference between a negotiation between countries who respect the rule of law, respect basic principles like sovereignty and dealing with a rogue state like Russia. “I have frank conversations with all our partners, whether it’s the United States, whether it’s the EU, whether it’s Japan, whether it’s India. There are always going to be differences that we need to resolve. But those types of differences between friends and allies are different from the scale and the sheer belligerence and aggression and lying of Russia.The scale of the issue that we’re facing with Russia is so big, it’s so important, it’s so vital that we all stick together.” Not even the most ardent Brexiteers would take issue with her distinction between the EU and Vladimir Putin’s Russia. However, some may be less sanguine if it emerges that the Foreign Secretary’s comparison is the precursor to a climbdown from securing urgent changes to the protocol.Ms Truss sticks to the government line that Article 16 - the mechanism that the UK could trigger to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol - “remains on the table” as an option. But her rhetoric about the importance of harmonious relations with the EU appears a far cry even from Boris Johnson’s remarks just six weeks ago, when he said: “If our friends don’t show the requisite common sense then of course, we will trigger Article 16.” Senior Brexiteer MPs, including at least two members of the Cabinet, have been arguing that the UK must trigger Article 16 in order to break the logjam in talks and fix the problems the agreement is said to be causing to Northern Ireland businesses. Ms Truss still insists “that the Northern Ireland Protocol isn’t working to protect the BelfastGood Friday Agreement” and that the Government’s priority is to protect that deal. But she does not deny having shelved the idea of triggering Article 16 any time soon, because of the need for a united EU front in the face of Russian aggression. Earlier this month, The  revealed that Ms Truss wrote to Mr Johnson about putting Article 16 on hold because of the Ukraine crisis. She asked that the Government instead helped Northern Ireland businesses with an “economic stimulus” package, including tax cuts. Such a move could only take place with the backing of Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor. Amid internal discussions over the issue, Ms Truss will only say of the protocol: “I am working to fix it as a matter of urgency.”Ms Truss, 46, was promoted from her role as international trade secretary last September, replacing Dominic Raab as Foreign Secretary. Within weeks, she said, it was clear that Russia was going to dominate her time in the post. “By December last year, we had a very strong view that he was likely to invade,” she said.The “we” here includes a multitude of Russia experts and intelligence officials who have been working to get the Foreign Secretary up to speed with the Kremlin’s playbook, which some argue has changed very little since the Cold War.Among those who advised Ms Truss as she navigated meetings with Sergei Lavrov, her Russian opposite number, in the run-up to the invasion was Sir Tim Barrow, the Foreign Office’s political director, formerly the UK’s envoy to the EU.Sir Tim joined the Foreign Office in 1986, where he learnt Russian before being posted to Kyiv in 1989 and Moscow the following year. Ms Truss jokingly refers to Sir Tim as a “relic” when she later introduces him at Lancaster House, a 19th century building often used to host foreign dignitaries. Sir Tim, 58, and the Foreign Secretary were both at Lancaster House for an away day for the Foreign Office’s board on Thursday, when Ms Truss sat down for an interview with The   in a lavishly decorated ground floor room overlooking the  garden.“This is one of the many reasons why I think the UK has such an important role to play in this crisis,” Ms Truss said of figures such as Sir Tim.“We do have Russia experts, we do have Ukraine experts and we have people who were around at the end of the Cold War, who were doing things like supporting the Baltic governments in exile. And we’ve seen the playbook again, in Syria, in other conflicts Russia has been involved in, but we also saw it during the Cold War. And some of those techniques that were there then are there now.”As a more junior Cabinet minister under Theresa May, Ms Truss’ kitchen table in her South West Norfolk constituency was the subject of regular Instagram posts documenting family breakfasts and “pizza Thursdays”. She is seen as the Cabinet’s most enthusiastic adopter of social media.Today, her posts are dominated by pictures of the now Foreign Secretary standing behind lecterns and holding talks with world leaders and fellow foreign ministers. Her kitchen table, too, has become a hub of discussions about the finer details of foreign policy.“My elder daughter is actually studying the Cold War, so there are quite a lot of family discussions about what happened then and the parallels to what’s happening now,” said Ms Truss. She has two daughters with her husband Hugh O’Leary, the eldest of whom, Frances, is 16.The Ukraine crisis “is taking up my night and day”, she said, pointing out that it is difficult to switch off after conversations in which her Ukrainian counterpart telephones from Kyiv to press her for more sanctions and weapons.Ms Truss has played a leading role in the campaign for crippling sanctions against Moscow. She is now continuing to push Western countries to end all oil and gas imports from Russia. Along with Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, she has also been working to counter disinformation before it can take hold, setting up the Government Information Cell to dispel Kremlin falsehoods relating to the invasion of Ukraine.She said: “We’ve been exposing the plans to create a false flag around chemical weapons and I think this has been crucial in removing the aspect of surprise from what Putin is doing, and also convincing the international community that Putin is the aggressor.“He’s been unable to create a pretext for his invasion.”Ms Truss also revealed that she has set up a specialist negotiations unit to provide support to Ukraine “when the Russians are serious about negotiations”.She added: “I don’t believe they are serious at present and that’s why I’ve said we need to be tough to get peace. We need to double down on sanctions. We need to double down on the weapons that we’re sending Ukraine. But when there does come a time for negotiations, I want the UK to be a key part of making sure we support Ukraine to get a deal that works.”Ms Truss is convinced that a continuation - and in some cases escalation - of the current tactics being deployed by Ukraine and the West could bring Putin to the negotiating table.“Putin needs to be put under even more pressure”, she said - both “domestically through the economy and Russia being debilitated”, as well as by countries such as the UK continuing to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine.“With the supply of more weaponry to the Ukrainians, I think we could see his attempts to invade stall, she said. Over time, this will bear down on Putin’s ability to succeed and will ensure that he loses in Ukraine.“And at that point, we need to make sure that there isn’t a repeat of the Minsk process - that we actually end up in a situation where there is a genuine ceasefire, there’s a genuine withdrawal of troops from Ukraine, and there are real levers on Russia in the future to stop any future aggression.”The Minsk agreements were designed to secure a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country in 2014 and 2015, in a process brokered by Germany and France, then represented by Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel.“We should have been part of those negotiations,” said Ms Truss, who was environment secretary at the time of the talks, when David Cameron’s coalition was in power.“We should have done more to stop Putin in 2014. And we are essentially facing the situation we are in now because - and this is not just Britain - the entire West, the entire free world, didn’t do enough to stop Putin.”Lessons have been learned, she said, adding: “What we know is that Russia signed up to multiple agreements they simply don’t comply with. So there needs to be hard levers. Of course, sanctions are a hard lever.“Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression. And also, there’s the opportunity to have snapback sanctions if there is further aggression in future. That is a real lever that I think can be used. That wasn’t used in 2014.”Her remarks about the conditions for lifting the current sanctions appear to sketch out Britain’s blueprint for the “off ramp” that could be offered to Putin to end his invasion. They chime with remarks by Antony Blinken, her US counterpart, who has said that American sanctions against Russia are “not designed to be permanent” and could “go away” if Moscow changes its behaviour.Mr Blinken has said that, for US sanctions to be lifted, there must be a Russian withdrawal that is “in effect, irreversible” - so “Russia won\u0027t pick up and do exactly what it’s doing in a year or two years or three years”. When asked about Joe Biden’s remarks that Nato “would respond” if Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, Ms Truss echoed he White House\u0027s message.“That would represent an escalation of this appalling conflict, she said. We’ve already seen abhorrent acts committed against civilians in Ukraine, but the use of chemical weapons would represent an escalation and there would be a response.”In the final months of Theresa May’s premiership, Ms Truss was seen as constantly “on manoeuvres” and attempting to flaunt her own potential leadership credentials. But as the Prime Minsiter’s position weakened in late 2021 and the first weeks of 2022 amid several scandals, she has shown dogged loyalty towards the Prime Minister. Ms Truss is careful not to criticise Mr Sunak\u0027s Spring Statement. But she does pinpoint “supply-side reforms”, such as tax cuts and deregulation, including an overhaul of childcare, as key to reducing the cost of living.“The Chancellor has committed that taxes are going to be cut, she said. That’s very, very important because ultimately, the way to get the cost of living down in the long-term is supply side reform, and it’s doing what we need to do to generate economic growth. And whether it’s on making childcare more affordable, which I’ve long been a champion of, whether it’s making housing more affordable, that is ultimately what will bring down the cost of living.”She defended Mr Johnson against claims that he likened the Ukrainian resistance against Putin to the UK’s decision to leave the EU. “I was sitting in the audience for that speech and I certainly don’t think that’s what he was doing. He was talking about the British people’s right to exercise their democratic freedom, as part of a general speech about freedom in which he also talked about people’s freedom once they had got the coronavirus vaccine.”Here, she segued into another reminder of the closeness with which Britain is working with the EU on the Western response to Putin’s invasion.“One of the points I would make about this crisis is we have worked very, very closely with the European Union, she said.“The EU are doing a lot of work to reduce their dependence on Russian gas, including sourcing liquid natural gas from the States and I support and applaud those efforts.“Of course, there are some areas with which we have differences with the EU. But fundamentally, we are all democratic nations, we all believe in freedom and the right of people to select their own governments and we are very much united in the fight.”More from NewsJoe Biden’s gaffe is ‘a gift’ to an isolated and increasingly erratic Vladimir PutinGlobalisation has run its sorry course.

It’s just a bit of fun and a nod to the amazing ladies who work the land here. I didn’t think it would cause offence, but in reality women plough too!”The ploughman’s lunch joins an ever-growing list of dishes and products that have been forced to change their names after criticism.Last June, Waitrose announced it was relabelling its own-brand Kaffir lime leaves following complaints from customers that it was racist.The word “kaffir”, which is also a slur used to describe black African people in South Africa, was removed from the ingredient’s packaging and replaced with “makrut”.Similarly, Marks \u0026amp Spencer was forced to change the name of the canned version of the pornstar martini cocktail, after feminist campaigners complained it was “normalising porn”. It is now sold as the Passion Star Martini.The retailer had to make another rebrand earlier this year after it was deemed that Midget Gems, its popular variety of sweets, might offend people with dwarfism.Marks \u0026amp Spencer changed the name of the fruit gums to Mini Gems, following a campaign launched by Dr Erin Pritchard of Liverpool Hope University, who has achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism.Dr Pritchard said in a newspaper interview at the time: “I’m grateful that M\u0026ampS has been willing to listen to the concerns of people with dwarfism and has gone ahead with the rebranding.”More from NewsJoe Biden’s gaffe is ‘a gift’ to an isolated and increasingly erratic Vladimir PutinGlobalisation has run its sorry course.

I took her to the pub the other day. But you know, not only is it a terrible disease in its later stages, but of course in the early stages it’s immensely frustrating when you can’t remember things and you worry about being forgetful.“It’s a cause of stress and depression as well as being a terrible thing in itself. So seeing it first-hand, it teaches you a lot about the very human side.”He said she is being well supported by his brother, Alexander Cameron QC, and two sisters, Tania Rachel Cameron and Clare Louise Cameron who live nearby.Their mother Mary Cameron had served as a magistrate in Newbury for more than 30 years and in 2017 won an award for campaigning against the closure of a children\u0027s centre hit by cuts David Cameron had brought in.As prime minister, Mr Cameron promised to double dementia research funding. In fact it nearly quadrupled, from £27 million in 2009-10 to £98 million in 2015-16.Boris Johnson in his 2019 election manifesto, pledged to double funding again to £160 million, in what he called a “dementia moonshot”.However, latest figures show the annual budget for the next five years is £75 million and it must be shared with research for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease.More from NewsJoe Biden’s gaffe is ‘a gift’ to an isolated and increasingly erratic Vladimir PutinGlobalisation has run its sorry course.

A rapid demographic change is underway, reshaping the nation’s economic, political and cultural contours. For as long as anyone can remember, America’s big business clusters were in the northeast, the midwest and California. New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles were the kinds of places where enterprising young Americans would go to make their way in the world.Not anymore. In just twelve months between July 2020 and July 2021, these four cities lost over 700,000 people. A very different phenomenon is playing out in conservative states, especially in the south. Almost 80 per cent of the population growth in 2021 happened in a mere ten counties. Five of the fastest growing counties were in Texas and two in Florida. The fastest of all was Maricopa county in Arizona, which is rapidly filling up with large numbers of Californian emigres.What do the growth states have in common? They favour freedom. From snow-capped Utah to swampy Florida, geography and climate are not the decisive factor state politics is. As free states thrive, radical progressives drive businesses away from their traditional hubs. Last year, Elon Musk moved Tesla\u0027s corporate HQ from California to Texas. Thousands of lower-profile businesses have made the same move. Whereas California has managed to combine European level taxation with third world level public service, free states like Texas, Tennessee and Florida do not have a state income tax at all. While in New York and Silicon Valley, permits are needed to do almost anything, states like Arizona and Utah have imposed radical red tape reduction plans.Contemporary America remains bitterly ided between these two tribes. Conservative America drives pick-up trucks, prefers its taxes low and its government small. Here the Oath of Allegiance is pledged daily, and American exceptionalism accepted as self-evident. Progressive America, on the other hand, drives a Prius rather than a pick-up and is far more likely to worry about climate change. This tribe has a fundamentally different conception of what America is, was and ought to be, and prefers to focus on intersectional identity above any kind of exceptionalism.Opinion formers in Britain, citing Biden’s win over Trump, often assume that America is moving inexorably towards a more progressive future. Yet a rather different picture is emerging.States aren’t just depopulating due to an exodus of enterprising people. Progressive America is literally dying deaths in Democrat cities and states have started to exceed births. Though birth rates have fallen across the board in the past decade, it has been most pronounced in places where folk have gone woke, perhaps losing interest in raising a family in the process. Women in conservative America on average marry significantly younger than they do in progressive states.As Chicagoans and Californians flood into Texas, Arizona and Tennessee in search of a better life, many conservatives fear that they will bring their progressive voting habits with them. A more optimistic scenario is that as the most entrepreneurial abandon progressive controlled areas in favour of free ones, they will merely reinforce the intensely inidualistic mindset that already exists there.What is certain is that two models of American identity are engaged in a fierce battle at a federal level. Because the US system allows interstate competition, here in Mississippi we are leading a campaign to abolish the state income tax. We  have written a new law on universal occupational licensing to make it easier for outsiders to come and work here.What if this kind of localism were normal in Britain? What sort of innovation could be unleashed?

Despite the lack of information, Rose instinctively knew his men were on board. “I knew in my heart of hearts it was ours,” he recalls.About an hour later, Rose was stopped in a passageway on the ship by Julian Thompson, the commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade, who broke the news that the Sea King helicopter that had gone down while transporting troops and equipment between two Navy ships was carrying members of two separate SAS squadrons.Ultimately, more than 20 troops were killed in the crash on May 19, 1982 – the worst single loss of life in the history of the elite regiment since its formation during the Second World War. The men either died on impact or drowned in the freezing ocean. Just nine survived.“He later said it was the only time he had seen me fall silent,” Rose recalls. “One’s heart just stops.”Back in Britain, an operation clicked into gear to send a military representative to tell all the families of the killed troops at precisely the same time, to prevent word leaking out first. The final widow was tracked down to a supermarket in Newcastle, where the awful news was delivered.The following evening, Rose gathered the survivors from both SAS squadrons below deck on HMS Intrepid to make the hardest speech of his life. Even more so given the rattle of anti-aircraft fire and explosions as the Argentinians launched aerial attacks on the British fleet.Six weeks after the invasion had started, the Falklands War was at a critical juncture, and Rose told his troops now was not the time to grieve.“The SAS was already deployed,” he says, “and we had been there since three weeks before the main landings and were scattered all over the place. You can’t stop at that point. The war just went on.”Rose has never previously given a newspaper interview about his role during the Falklands, and as Britain prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of the conflict, he insists he is only doing so because he is not bound by the normal code of silence the SAS usually applies to its operations. He says after the loss of the Sea King helicopter in 1982, the Ministry of Defence took the decision to break with established protocols and “tell the world what the SAS had been achieving to justify that terrible loss”.He is giving the interview ahead of a new documentary into the Falklands campaign which airs on Channel 4 tonight and features Rose alongside other senior commanders. In reflecting on the campaign in the documentary he is especially critical over the decision-making which led to the Argentine bombing of the Navy ships Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad (the deadliest day of the war). Rose describes the subsequent board of inquiry into the tragedy as a complete whitewash and claims the defence that the ships were deployed because of the need to open up a southern flank are untrue. He is also critical of some of the decision-making at Northwood headquarters which directed operations from the UK. We very nearly lost the war because of some extraordinary bad decisions that were taken by Northwood with regards to the land battle, he says.At 82 years old, Sir Michael Rose, who retired from the military in 1997 as a General, still looks every inch the Special Forces soldier. He sits ramrod straight, despite having recently broken a rib falling off a ladder, and regularly thumps the table in front of him for emphasis. We meet in a pub close to his home in Herefordshire – SAS country, where the regiment trains and where he still bumps into old comrades on country yomps who greet him with “Hello, boss”. “They are a very active bunch,” he reports of his fellow SAS retirees.His command of the elite unit gave him a ringside seat to the key geopolitical moments of the 1980s and 1990s. Rose was in a command room two doors down from the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 when the SAS stormed the building, in front of the world’s media, to kill the gunmen who had taken 26 people hostage.His position also afforded him unique access to then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Rose recalls her visiting Northern Ireland in August 1979, just a few months after she became PM, following the Warrenpoint ambush (the deadliest attack on British troops during the Troubles).A month or so after the success of the Iranian Embassy siege, Thatcher flew by helicopter to visit SAS barracks in Herefordshire, and he engineered an hour-long private meeting. Afterwards, his wife, Angela, and two young children were invited by the prime minister for tea at 10 Downing Street.The history of the SAS in the Falklands is not without controversy. Infamously, the regiment was involved in the botched Operation Mikado, a failed attempt to attack an Argentinian air base. Rose agrees it was “an utter disaster”, but insists he played no part in the operation as it was run separately from his chain of command.Similarly, an early assault on South Georgia involving the SAS failed due to appalling weather conditions, which resulted in the loss of two helicopters.But, as Rose is quick to point out, SAS troops were also involved in pivotal moments of the conflict. Most famous is the combined assault on Pebble Island, a daring raid that destroyed around a dozen Argentine aircraft.For Rose, the most important role the SAS provided was the “critical intelligence on which land battle was based”. One of his commandos, he says, spent 28 days hiding out on Mount Kent in wind, rain and snow, with just one resupply, to wire back constant updates of the enemy position.Key to their success were state-of-the-art portable satellite communication systems that Rose had personally borrowed from a contact in the US Special Forces. At the time, the only British Army satellite communication system was so large, it required a Land Rover to carry it.Aside from commanding and equipping his men, Rose also personally played a unique role in the conflict – by being the man to negotiate the Argentine surrender.He established a line of communications with the enemy through a captured Argentine air commodore, and secured an agreement to meet the military governor of the island, Mario Menendez, in Port Stanley.After a tense four hours of late-night negotiations with the governor, who Rose recalls as immaculately dressed in white gloves and an utterly “useless inidual”, the surrender was agreed. The following morning, he hoisted a Union flag borrowed from one of his SAS Squadrons as the first to fly over Port Stanley.“Punching the air is for football matches,” he says of the victory. “At the end of a war like that, you just feel very tired and relieved.”Certainly, the Falklands was not to be his last conflict. Later, he commanded UN forces during the war in Bosnia. And, in a bleak retelling of history, he notes the same tactics employed by the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic during the siege of Sarajevo as are now being used by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. “They are shelling cities almost as a fall-back position, but it is not going to win them the war,” he says.Putin, he believes, is “completely deranged”, but warns against Nato provocation by installing a no-fly zone or troops in Ukraine: “He needs to be very carefully handled.”In preparation of the 40th anniversary of the Falklands, Rose started unpacking some of the old boxes in his home. Among the various mementos was a box of tape recordings of the peace negotiations which had been taken from his satellite phone. He dug out an old tape recorder and listened to them all. “At one point, I can hear myself saying: ‘He’s agreed to surrender everything. The war is over,’” he says. “When I heard that again, the hairs came up on the back of my neck.”Even 40 years on, Rose is still coming to terms with its legacy.

But what sets this one apart is the sheer scale of the crisis hitting Brits. whose disposable incomes will see the sharpest fall since records began in . The millionaire Chancellor promised to help families with skyrocketing prices through a p fuel duty cut now, and a big rise in National Insurance thresholds in July.It’s £bn of tax cuts - but analysis shows it’s a drop in the ocean, as inflation soars close to % and the tax burden still rises overall between now and . The Resolution Foundation also slammed the Chancellor for giving £ out of every £ to the wealthier half, as there’s no new increase to benefits or cash help for energy bills. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Boris Johnson said “it will continue to be tough, it will continue to be chippy, but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout”.But what do the charts from his own Treasury, watchdogs, and independent think tanks say  We’ve taken a look at  that highlight the enormity of the problems facing the economy... Inflation is rocketing to a -year high  Inflation is due to rocket to .% on average in   and could peak at nearly %. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the rise “will erode real incomes and consumption”, slashing GDP growth from a % forecast to .% this year. This graph highlights just how steeply inflation has climbedbeyond what experts thought it would hit five months ago , due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This will be the highest inflation in the history of the OBR, which was set up in .  This graph from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows the same inflation data but going back to . It shows inflation will peak above the .% it hit in  andto levels not seen since the early s. Disposable incomes will suffer the biggest drop since the s - at least  Brits’ household disposable incomes per person will fall .% in real terms in -, due to inflation outstripping wages. That is the biggest fall in a single year since records began in . And this is even after factoring in £ support for energy bills, the temporary cut in fuel duty and rise in National Insurance thresholds. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this help announced since October has offset around a third of the fall in living standards.  This Office for Budget Responsibility graph is an even starker way of portraying the same data. It shows disposable incomes only fell in real terms in nine years since the s - four of them since the Tories took power in . And the fall projected for - is by far the deepest, outstripping those in the s or the wake of the  financial crash. Wages are now £k lower than without the  crash  This shocking chart on wages from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the same problem in the starkest way yet. The experts warned wages are now £, lower than what they could have beenthe trend of - had continued. The financial crash of  still cases a long shadow over politics today. The national debt wasnapost cut by the Tories This chart from the Treasury explodes the myth that the Tories brought down ‘ Labour ’s debt’ from the financial crash with austerity.Net debt shot up due to the bank bailouts and other measures of , but has continued rising since and spiked again due to Covid. It is still predicted to be .% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And the cost of servicing that debt rockets as inflation rises. Since the last forecast, the cost of servicing the national debt has risen by more than £billion in - alone.  This chart shows the same data but with a longer timescale, showing how debt was more than double Britain’s GDP after the Second World War - but fell steadily as the decades rolled on. That falling of debt continued through the s and stayed low until the financial crash. It jumped, then climbed further under the Tories. Rishi Sunakaposs new apostax cutsapos do exist - but overall itaposs still a tax hike  Rishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor with cuts to National Insurance, fuel duty and a p income tax cut from April .But the IFS think tank has warned the tax burden will in fact be rising, not falling, overall because frozen thresholds will drag .million more people into paying income tax. In this chart, the Office for Budget Responsibility finds the Chancellor’s tax cuts barely make a dent in all the tax rises that have been announced in . The OBR found previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%.  This is a dferent way of looking at the same information on tax. In this chart, the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how ‘Illusionist’ Rishi Sunak is in fact raising taxes on Brits - not cutting them. A median earner on £, will be £ worse off in   than   - a £k earner will be nearly £ worse off. Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October. In fact, taxes are set to rise to their highest level as a fraction of national income since Clement Attlee was prime minister.”  This graph shows just how fast the tax burden has shot up to a record high since Covid. The OBR warns the tax burden overall will reach .% of GDP in - - the highest level since the late s. That’s up from % of GDP in -. It’s fuelled by rising National Insurance but also in frozen thresholds in income tax until .

Mr Johnson himself has insisted it is “simply incorrect” that he personally or directly asked for the advice to be reversed.But Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to Tory MP William Wragg, chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs committee, calling on him to use the body to investigate the circumstances surrounding the peerage.And she urged him to invite Mr Johnson himself to give evidence before the committee.  She wrote: “Given that Mr Lebedev is still a sitting member of the House of Lords, and the wider issues continue to be of concern in relation to any future appointments, it is in the British public’s interest to ensure that these allegations can be thoroughly investigated.” Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s former top aide last week used a blog post to claim he had been in the room when Cabinet Office officials informed Mr Johnson about the concerns. I supported these concerns and said to the PM in his study explicitly that he should not go ahead, he wrote. He was very cross and as he does when cross he blustered nonsense. ‘This is just … You’re just … [pause] ANTI-RUSSIAN!’ Mr Cummings claimed two others who were in the room would back his version of events in court.

A survey for pollster Opinium found Mr Sunakaposs net approval rating had dropped four points to % and nearly seven in tenthink the Government should be doing more to tackle rising cost of living. The Government is facing a fierce backlash to Mr Sunakaposs Spring Statement, which did little to help families facing rising energy bills and sky-high inflation. Meanwhile, Labouraposs poll lead over the Conservatives rose to %, with Boris Johnsonaposs party on %. A flurry of reports on Sunday suggested the Chancellor was preparing another multi-billion pound bailout in the autumn, when energy bills are expected to rise again. Brits in some council tax bands are eligible for some money off their bill and a separate £ loan, with the cash to be clawed back the following year, was also announced by the Chancellor.Speaking on Sky News, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it would be irresponsible to say “job done” for Mr Sunak over the cost-of-living crisis.He told Sky’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday show: “I think he will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say job done. “But I think £ billion, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £ billion is the right thing to do.” The poll also found nearly three fthsthink the state of the UK economy will get worse in the next year. Almost halfexpect their personal finances to worsen, with just % thinking they will get better. James Crouch, Head of Policy  Public Affairs at Opinium said: The government’s decision to keep their powder dry for the Budget has been far from popular in the short term.Precious few think the measures announced in the Spring Statement will help the economy, or benefit them directly, while seven in ten think the government has failed to do enough to tackle the cost of living crisis.Once incredibly popular, Rishi Sunakaposs approval ratings are now in negative territory, demonstrating the impact of the economic situation on the government’s fortunes. Although it has yet to feed into an increased Labour lead, the Conservatives should be very worried by the poor response voters gave to the Spring Statement.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonLabour PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Conservative PartyEuropean UnionSpring StatementBritish economyThe economyPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But he said he had “always tried to be honest with people”, and said: “I can’t protect them from absolutely everything that we face.” Mr Sunak said he was “anxious” on behalf of the country and said he knew rising financial pressures were “the number one concern that people have right now”. Speaking on Beth Rigby Interviews on Sky News, he said: “Families are struggling with the rising cost of lots of things and that’s why in the spring statement I wanted to make sure that we demonstrated we were on people’s side, and we announced the tax plan that will deliver the biggest net cut taxes, net cut to personal taxes in two years, in quarter of a century taken together.” He said: “Where we can make a dference, we will, and I’m confident that the plan yesterday will do that.”  The Chancellor added: “I think what we’ve done is substantial. If you take together £ billion to help people with energy bills announced last month, the signicant tax cuts that we announced yesterday, they will all help. But of course they can’t mitigate all the dficulties that high inflation is causing. No chancellor could do that.”Earlier, Downing Street said ministers stood ready to provide further support to householdsrequired after Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to suggest more measures could be announced.Mr Johnson admitted it was “going to be tough” as households had to cope with rising prices and the cost-of-living squeeze. He said: “It will continue to be tough, continue to be choppy but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout.” Separately, he told LBC “as we go forward, we need to do more” and insisted the Government would “fix” the rising cost of living.Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Thursday that despite the measures announced by Mr Sunak, people still face an “unprecedented” fall in living standards.The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the Chancellor had failed to protect the country’s poorest households. But Mr Sunak insisted he had “protected those on the lowest incomes the most” in recent years.  Asked about figures from the Resolution Foundation think tank, which said . million Britons were set to fall below the poverty line next year, including , children, Mr Sunak told Beth Rigby Interviews: “Well, I mean, what we do know is the track record, because there’s lots of projections and speculation about the future, but the track record shows that over the last  years, since we’ve had Conservative governments in charge, the number of people living in poverty has actually declined by about . million people. “That includes , children from memory. So actually, that’s a record that I’m proud of. “Now, obviously, a lot of that happened before I was in post. But the actions I’ve taken over the past couple of years have ensured that we have protected those on the lowest incomes the most.” Told that it felt like the country was being “gaslighted” by his reassurances amid the rising costs and as inflation rose, he said: “I’m not denying for one second that inflation is dficult. Of course it’s dficult, and it’s most dficult for those on lower incomes.” The Chancellor, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the PM, also failed three times to rule out that he could launch a leadership bid in the future. He read a quote from Mr Johnson, who said in  that being prime minister “would be a great, great thing to have a crack at”,“the ball came loose from the back of the scrum”, and askedhe felt the same. Mr Sunak said: “I’m much more a cricket and football fan, so I don’t know what the appropriate analogy is.

Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi used an interview with Sky News on Sunday to underline it was “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed”.After meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland, Mr Biden made comparisons between the invasion of Ukraine and the horrors of the Second World War. “For God’s sake this man cannot remain in power,” he said of the Russian president at the close of his speech.  He also made a direct appeal to the Russian people, saying: “If you’re able to listen – you, the Russian people, are not our enemy.” Following the speech, White House officials tried to argue that the US president intended meaning was that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”.“He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” one official said, before reports in the US suggested the remarks in question had not been scripted.Interviewed on Sunday, Mr Zahawi said it is “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” but suggested they “would certainly do well” to have someone who “is democratic and understands their wishes”. “I think that’s up to the Russian people,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies.” But he declined to criticise Mr Biden, unlike Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, who said Mr Putin will now “spin this, dig in and fight harder”. AskedMr Biden was wrong to issue the call, Mr Zahawi replied: “No, what I’m saying to you is the White House has been very clear on this, the president gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that it’s up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetWorld War Tobias EllwoodJoe BidenNadhim ZahawiVladimir PutinFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Katherine Fletcher was accused of an insult on struggling families after Rishi Sunakaposs mini-Budget last week failed to offer the poorest help for the looming cost-of-living crisis despite soaring energy bills and food prices.The Chancellor refused to reinstate the £ uplt to Universal Credit and, despite inflation set to average % this year, uprated benefits by a measly %, meaning low-income families will in fact be hit hardest.The Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, calculated a staggering .m people, including , children, will be left facing absolute poverty this year as a result.But South Ribble MP Ms Fletcher sought to duck responsibility for the governmentaposs decisions when she appeared on BBC Politics North West.She attacked the Foundation, whose executive chairman is former Tory MP David Willetts, for not being fair or neutral, before outrageously suggesting people were sitting on benefits.  Weaposve got the same number of people unemployed at the moment as weaposve got same number of job vacancies, she said. The best way to help anyone out of relative or absolute poverty is to help them get a job. Told that even people in work were facing levels of poverty not seen in decades, Ms Fletcher replied no, no, and went on: You get any job, you get a better job, you get a career. She said the government was backing a plan for jobs, before adding: I went to see the job centre at Leyland the other day. Theyaposve got more vacancies than weaposve got job seekers. So thereaposs huge effort to put that in. People sitting on benefits - thataposs not helping them. Labouraposs Shadow Employment Minister Alison McGovern said Mr Sunak has failed to support the worst-hit families, adding: “For a Tory MP to suggest people are sitting around on benefits shows we’re being governed by the same old Tories. While working families are striving to make ends meet in the face of callous Conservative decisions that are making their lives harder, we have a Tory MP doing nothing more than insult them. This tired Tory Government is out of touch, out of ideas, and hopefully soon out of office. The Resolution Foundation found that a typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said.Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.The Foundation warned the Tory Chancelloraposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will also mostly benefit people in work.  Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the expertsapos analysis found. “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions, the think tank said.It came as Mr Sunak was branded “Mr Tax” by shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth, as the Labour frontbencher warned pensioners have been “cutting back on hot meals” and “forgoing hot showers” as they cannot afford the cost.The Chancellor is reported to be considering proposals for a second council tax rebate to help ease the impact of soaring fuel bills, according to the Sunday Times, as even backbench Tories are piling the pressure on Mr Sunak to act. His package of support, which was announced before the mini-Budget, includes a £ up-front rebate on energy bills from October, which will be clawed back next year, plus a £ council tax rebate for homes in bands A to D from next month.Mr Ashworth told Sophy Ridge On Sunday on Sky News: “ Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games.“He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPsthere’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.  “I don’t believe that putting . million people into poverty because you’re imposing a very severe real-terms cut to Universal Credit, you’re imposing the biggest cut to the pension in  years, is fair.” Mr Ashworth said Mr Sunak should have imposed a “windfall tax” on the profits of oil and gas companies to generate funds to help struggling families and pensioners with energy bills. He said: “He chose not to do that. “Instead, he’s imposed these very punishing tax rises, these very severe real-terms cuts to the pension and support like universal credit, and he’s expecting people to be grateful because two years down the road he’s saying there’s going to be an income tax cut even though that income tax cut nowhere near offsets the  tax rises that he has imposed on the British people, £, extra per householdyou do a rough and ready calculation. “He is a tax-rising Chancellor, he is Mr Tax and it’s the British people who are paying the price.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi hinted more help was on the way, when he said it would be irresponsible to say “job done” by Mr Sunak over the cost-of-living crisis.He told the same programme: “I think he will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’.

Several videos have been posted on the social media site of people injecting henna or black ink into their faces in an attempt to emulate the Duchess of Sussex.Several of the home jobs have left the young women in need of medical help as they triggered allergic reactions, with some facing permanent scarring on their faces. By using needles which may have not been sterilised they run the risk of catching the likes of HIV.The Mail Online reported Laura Kay, a London-based make-up artist, saying: “I wouldn’t advise that you get tattoo freckles done. “People who do tattoos at home without a licence are known as scratchers, and that’s not legal. “Tattoo artists must have a licence, and DIY tattoos pose a real risk of HIV or hepatitis.” Removal of the bodged “freckles” can end up costing people hundreds of pounds. Make-up specialist Sian Dellar, added most of those applying fake freckles were aged  to .

Gruinard Island was reduced to ashes after the fire took hold on Saturday night. People were astonished to witness the flames and smoke billowing into the atmosphere after the blaze took over the island in Wester Ross, Scotland.They took to social media to tell of the devastation which was seen from the Hebridean isles the Daily Record reports.One person saw the wrote: Gruinard Island ablaze, reports of seeing fire from Lewis. Another poster added: Very sad seeing Gruinard Island in flames but even sadder hearing the haunting screeching of the oyster catchers and geese.  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said they were not aware of the wildfire until Sunday morning. And crews did not respond because there are no inhabitants on the island. The island in Wester Ross, known to many as aposAnthrax Islandapos, was contaminated during World War  after it became a testing site for biological weapons. Sheep were exposed to deadly bombs packed with anthrax on the island, which killed the livestock within days.  When inhaled, anthrax spores can damage the lungs and is often fatal. Direct contact with anthrax can also cause raised boil-like lesions on the skin. Gruinard was a no-go zone until it was declared safe by the UK Government in  following a major clean-up operation in . The British Army tested anthrax on the Island off the Scottish coast during World War II.  It led to spores of the infectious disease still being considered deadly decades later. Anthrax symptoms include fever, chills, and extreme fatigue, but the bodyaposs own defences can trigger deadly sepsis. The test was one of several Cold War incidents where animals were cruelly exposed to potentially genocidal weapons.

For many the crisis isnapost just about paying a few extra quid on council tax or energy costs, it will be wearing an extra jumper to avoid putting the heating on, on cutting back on your weekly shop.Joanne Lao, from Newport, has even made the decision to stop buying her nine-year-oldaposs son favourite cherry bakewells after they doubled in price, WalesOnline reports.She said: The ones we usually have from Asda are like p - we went in this week and they were £. for the same box.  Weaposve had to stop buying them now - itaposs just too much money. In recent months UK residents have seen rising costs from National Insurance, council tax, fuel prices and supermarket, with gas and electricity bills expected to increase in the coming month.And despite announcing a host of measures to tackle the cost of living on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak hasnapost inspired many that he will be able to fix the problem.The people of Duffryn in Newport are ones who will be penny pinching even more now after previously admitting they would need to borrow money just to afford their heating bills.

Because Iaposm a single parent that works, Iaposm over the threshold for any help so Iaposve still got to pay for my childrenaposs school meals and things like that. But obviously Iaposm still on one wage and Iaposve got to pay my mortgage and everything. I feel Iaposm in a bit of a bad place with that. I think Iaposm kind of in the worst position. Sometimes I think Iaposd probably be better off not working at all, because Iaposd probably get help. Itaposs dficult. I am worried about it. Iaposve got nobody  to rely on for income - itaposs literally all on me. It makes me extra stressed in work, becauseanything happens to my job, thereaposs no backup. I have a good job, work full time, I went to university and got a masters. But it feels like itaposs still not enough. If Iaposm on a fair wage, over £-, a year, and Iaposm struggling to look after two children, I dread to think how people with a lower income can do that.  Iaposm not sure what can be done. Some sort of cap, maybe. It feels like itaposs spiralling out of control, everything. How supermarkets can get away with increasing everything so signicantly, is unbelievable really. Keith Bennett lives in Sandpiper Way in Duffryn with his partner. The -year-old says his costs have spiralled in recent months and are set to go up even more in April. I was paying £ a week for electric - thataposs gone up to £, he said. It was £ a year and theyaposve estimated it will be £, in April. My gas has gone up from £ to £. Then youaposve water on top of that.  My benefits wonapost cover it. Iaposve just got to try and work it out. My houses arenapost warm anyway, they lose the heat very quickly. They were built in . My thermometer is about  degrees in the winter - itaposs like a freeze box. Thereaposs the council tax rebate but youaposve got to go online and fill in [answer] questions. One of my friends stated he was on one benefit, and he couldnapost get it. Itaposs frightening - I canapost afford to eat sometimes. My children put £ onto my heating and say aposthere you go, have a bit more heatapos. Or theyaposll come around and cook me dinner and say things like aposweaposll get the meat dad, you just get the vegetablesapos. Thataposs what itaposs like. My family helps me a lot. My daughter is a nurse and sheaposs struggling. Her husband is too, and theyaposve got their own house and do as much overtime as they can. Keith said this weekaposs announcement by the chancellor would make little dference to older people and those struggling with their energy bills. He said: Itaposs not going to make no dference for the pensioners. Sure you can put the threshold up, but the income tax changes arenapost until . It might help the richer but on the lower end of the scale it wonapost help. Nan Cath Williams, , works in Asda but only does  hours per week due to health issues, meaning she has been struggling with finances recently.  I canapost work many hours because of my health. It is a struggle, she said. Itaposs been ongoing for a while. The heating is terrible - I put the heating on at  oaposclock in the morning for three or four hours. Thataposs all I can afford. Before I used to put it on in the morning for two or three hoursit was cold, and then in the evening. The electric has doubled. The heating, we had new systems one or two years ago. That made it soar. Before that, it was in with the rent. Itaposs all separate now. Shoppingaposs got to suffer. The prices in Asda have gone up, and itaposs not by  or p, you know - itaposs  or p. I buy unbranded things just to keep going. Iaposve got two boys, theyaposre grown up but they eat like horses. I havenapost got savings, I canapost save. Everything goes on the house. If you want to do DIY, youaposve got to save for a month just to get a tin of paint. Itaposs not always been like that. I am coping, but itaposs a struggle.  We need more help. We had the winter payment for the payment, but we put that in and itaposs gone already. Poll [council] tax, water, rent - itaposs all going up. I am on universal credit, butI do any overtime they just take it off me. So I either work all the hours and get none, or the other way around. Theyaposre supposed to be giving us money for council tax, but then theyaposre putting it up. The amount theyaposre giving us isnapost enough to go through the year. I am worried. Iaposve got a smart meter, and itaposs in my face all the time. I feel like hiding it. If I put on the kettle, I only put one cup of water in. I wonapost be able to retire until Iaposm . While ex-railway worker Dave Clark is also another pensioner worried about the increasing cost of living. The -year-old said: Iaposve just paid £ for three monthsapos electric, for the same amount that cost me £ before. Theyaposre saying itaposs going up again in a weekaposs time to about £ a year. Does it worry me  It does and it doesnapost -you havenapost got it you canapost pay them. When you get older, itaposs not nice to go into the debt. They could help with the VAT or something, I think. Iaposm on my own and Iaposve noticed costs going up, and thataposs not by a penny or two like it always does. A packet of frozen chips is going up by  or p. Itaposs terrible.

They say Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement, with its p cut on fuel duty and National Insurance threshold increase, does not go far enough and the reality on the ground is stark.For people living in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where the number claiming Universal Credit has almost doubled in two years, day-to-day le is a struggle, reports the MEN. A trip to the town centre found a carer regularly surviving on one jacket potato a day, a pensioner whose food shop have soared from £ to £ and a mum who feels like a failure as she struggles to pay for school trips.Brits now face the biggest fall in income on record as inflation looks set to hit as much as %. In Oldham, a town with the second worst level of child poverty in the country, Julie Nuttall sits down clutching a polystyrene box. “This is our daily food,” she says, pointing down at her jacket potato. We might have a sandwich later, but this is our main meal.”It’s a hot March morning and the smell of baked potatoes fills the air. For Julie and her nephew Shaun, this food truck is a leline. It means they can afford to eat a proper meal today.“We’ve been walking aroundOldhamtrying to get the cheapest food we can,” the -year-old says. “We’re having child portions.”Like thousands of other families across Greater Manchester, Julie is facing the greatest uphill battle as the cost of living crisis cripples the country. A full-time carer for her disabled nephew, it’s a worry that keeps her up at night.“We do a lot of camping, we use an outside BBQ,” Julie, who lives in Hollins, said . “We’re going to have to make food on the BBQ just to cut back.“We’ve been given our bill for the next  months which has trebled in size. Weaposve switched the heating off now sowe get cold, we layer up. I know we have to pay and move on. But we have to cut back on usage and cut showers down. We have a disabled shower room which is going to make it dficult.  Weaposve had to cut back and prices are going back so we have to compensate somehow. Do you eat or heat  Thataposs the scenario. This time last year we were free. We could go into the community and come round here and not have to worry about what we had to eat. You go to bed and worry about what it will be like tomorrow. Barbara Szwandt stands outside a cafe with her daughter Janet. When asked about the cost of living crisis, a concerned look falls across her face.  The -year-old receives a pension but the money goes on rent and bills. Her financial situation once became so bleak, she was forced to beg people for warm clothes. Iaposve been struggling to get a coat and clothes,” she says. “Iaposve been going round askingpeople have clothes to spare. I donapost like begging and sometimes itaposs hard to do that. I had to get a coat instead of shopping. I have to ask my daughtershe has any shoes to spare.Barbara, who lives in Oldham, says she can only afford basic food including bread, milk and potatoes. Her total food shop used to come to around £. Now, she claims it costs around £. Itaposs hard when you get £ a fortnight on pension, then you have to pay rent,” she continues. It doesnapost go nowhere. Thereaposs nowhere for anyone to speak to anyone and see what help is available. Iaposve lost contact with younger age groups I have to rely on my daughter to do things for me. I canapost do a proper shop. “What I used to get cost me about £, now itaposs costing £. Itaposs basically just bread, milk and potatoes.”  Mum-of-four Janet Szwandt gently rocks her three-year-old in his pram. The -year-old cares for four children, including her autistic son TG. Money is so tight at the moment she can’t afford to pay for school trips – something that makes her feel like a “bad mum”. Itaposs horrible you feel like an emotional train wreck,” she says. “You get up and you donapost knowyouaposre going to have enough to survive the next week. Weaposve had to cut back on every day stuff like going to play centres. You canapost do anything because everything has gone up.  “Weaposve had to cut back on the monthly shop because we canapost afford to do it and it costs us a fortune. You have to budget what you need to spend to survive. Itaposs gone from £ a month to £. My daughter wants to go on school trips and I canapost afford to pay it. We canapost get the bus, we have to walk. Itaposs so silly we have to live like this. Itaposs even affecting the kids because they canapost understand why they canapost have essential things. They canapost have them because itaposs so dear. They canapost have pocket money. It just makes you feel bad as a mum because you canapost afford to give them what they want. You canapost make them happy. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets.

Janet has also been forced to rely on food banks recently. I used food banks now and again and came off it because I was able to survive on monthly shops,” she added. “But Iaposve noticed the money I had left over, we donapost have anymore. We have nothing to fall back on anymore. Having a child with disability needs is so hard. Sometimes we put the heating on in one room and all sit in there. Even pensioners are struggling because I see how much my mum struggles as much as me. My son has never been out to a play centre and he’s autistic- I just can’t afford to do it. Terrance Ball, from Chadderton, claims Universal Credit due to being disabled. After paying his bills, he says he’s “lucky”he has £ leftover.Itaposs hard, itaposs very hard,” the -year-old says. “Iaposm having to rob Peter to pay Paul. Iaposm having to borrow money off friends. “Iaposm struggling Iaposm in financial dficulty I cannot afford and Iaposm a vulnerable adult. Iaposm having to cut back like on the essentials. Iaposm diabetic and insulin dependent. I canapost afford the food I need. I have to borrow off my friend. Itaposs really hard. Sometimes me and my we sit on the settee and we both cry.” Oldham currently has the highest proportion of the -plus population on Universal Credit in Greater Manchester, according to new figures. There are currently , people claiming the benefit in Oldham Town North, or %. Across Greater Manchester, , people were on Universal Credit in February – .% of people aged  and over across the area. The number has increased from , in February . The government donapost give a damn about us. Itaposs not fair. Iaposm not happy Iaposm content. But I would rather be happy, Terrance continued. We feel like weaposre just existing. We canapost go on a night out we canapost afford a holiday - not even for a few days. Weaposre having to look after ourselves and we have a little girl we need to look after. It feels like weaposre living in the s. I have PTSD and a lot of underlying illnesses I have to eat and I have to get my medication and itaposs hard to get them. After Iaposve paid my bills, Iaposm luckyIaposve got £ left over.  Michael Brown, also from Oldham, says he is “just about” coping with the dramatic price increases – although it is something that causes him stress. He said he’s noticed a rise in his fortnightly shop. My electric has gone up £ a month and my central heating works out at £,” he says. Iaposm just about coping with it. I call myself a stress head anyway, so I do worry about it. Itaposs going to get worse and worse. I used to spend £ on a fortnight worth of shopping in Iceland. “The last few times itaposs been £ for the exact same stuff. Itaposs p here and p there but it all adds up.  Mark Webster takes a break on a bench while the sun beats down on Oldham town centre. While he says his family is stable financially, he has found himself having to work overtime to keep it that way. “Itaposs a worry for me. A couple of weeks ago I got an email from my energy supplier. My bills are increasing by £, altogether, additional to what Iaposm paying. Itaposs incredulous,” the -year-old says. I knew it was coming, but I didnapost think it would be that large. I donapost think I can challenge it. Iaposm working overtime to pay for things. Luckily my we works as well, weaposre not as bad off as other people are. The only thing I can hope is that Labour get in next time. Weaposre frugal anyway, but I think what I am doing is working more to pay for things and having to work extra days to afford it. Iaposve got three children and one is going to university this year so we have that extra cost coming up. I worry about the cost of things over the next couple of years. I worry about how dficult itaposs going to be for them buying houses and I donapost know how theyaposre going to save up for a deposit. Thataposs why I encourage them to go to university and get a decent job.

Syndicate PALS Marion Wood, , and Michael Williams, , from Northampton, were left speechless after matching five main numbers and a bonus ball on the National Lottery earlier this month.As NHS worker Marion read out the pairs numbers, Michael was in the kitchen checking the digits and even gave out a squeak when he realised how many theyaposd matched.Marion works at Northampton General Hospital and Michael is a retired construction worker - both will take home £, each.  Speaking about the le-changing draw, which left both in stunned silence and needing a cup of tea, Marion said: “I was on annual leave, it was the Tuesday after the Saturday draw which we won on. Michael and I always check our tickets for the last draw just before the next one. He was on his computer in the kitchen, I was in the lounge. “I started to shout out the numbers on my ticket and he shouted yes, then yes, then another yes and then his voice changed - in fact he squeaked! There was another yes and the final yes was followed by a ‘Can you come here please ’”  When Marion wandered into the kitchen and looked at the numbers on Michaelaposs screen she originally thought the amount theyaposd won was £,. She added: “I looked, looked again, Michael was going through the numbers one by one, and he kept on saying it’s a million, it’s a milli - and I said ‘I don’t know what a million in numbers looks like !’ Due to it being late on a Tuesday evening the pair had to excitedly wait until the following day to ring The National Lottery and make their claim.  “I’m a big tea drinker, so we had a cup of tea and sat in stunned silence as we absorbed what had just happened, Marion said. I didn’t tell a soul at first, I just carried on as normal holding onto the lucky ticket wherever I went. I kept the ticket in my diary, which I keep in my purse, until the lady from Camelot visited to check it and confirmed that Michael and I actually were big winners. “Even now it still hasn’t completely sunk in, but seeing our names on the big cheque has definitely made it feel more real.” Asked how they will celebrate she said, “I’m still unsure about what sort of celebration we’ll have but I am getting a taste for champagne having sipped a bit since the win. “Working through Covid in the NHS has been tough. The amount of work has increased and, unfortunately, I have lost many family and friends. However, work has kept me going, I love my job and I won’t be leaving even after this amazing win.”  When quizzed on what the pair will spend their winnings on Marion admitted she wants to carry on as normal for a bit, adding: I’m from an army family and routine is important to me so I think I’ll just let my head get around it first. I might treat myself to some jewellery, it will be nice to have something special to remember how I felt when I won.” While Michael, a father of three who retired last year, revealed heaposs going to spend his money on a his first car since  and some rugby memorabilia. He added: Finally, I’ll also treat my family, they’ve been good to me and it will be lovely to do something nice for them.” Marion, originally from Caerphilly, Wales, bought the winning ticket on Saturday, March  from her local Morrisons using number of friends and family memberaposs birthdays.

Every year people around the world honour mothers and mother figures by sending cards and flowers, buying gts or simply showing appreciation for mums. In the UK the date of Mothering Sunday falls changes each year, but it always falls on a Sunday. This year it falls on Sunday, March , but this is dferent for ious countries around the world. For example, in Belarus, Bulgaria and Uzbekistan, Motheraposs Day fell earlier in the month, on March , meanwhile, Norway celebrates on on the second Sunday in February. So why does the date change every year, and why is it dferent from country to country   Why does Motheraposs Day date change every year   The reason the date of Motheraposs Day changes in the UK every year is because it has to do with Easter. Motheraposs Day falls on the fourth Sunday during Lent. The date changes because the date of Lent changes every year depending on the cycle ion the moon. That means that Easter Sunday can occur on any Sunday between March  and April , meaning Motheraposs Day changes with it. Why do we celebrate Motheraposs Day  Motheraposs Day is actually a Christian tradition stemming from the th century when Christians would visit their mother church on the fourth Sunday of Lent. Also known as Mothering Sunday, it has in recent years become more widely known as Motheraposs Day. Why is it on a dferent date in ious countries   Motheraposs Day is an international celebration and appreciation day of all mother figures. However, the date it actually falls on ies from country to country. In the US they launched a completely separate event in , devoted entirely to honouring their mothers. The holiday has no connection to religion, and is what the modern day Motheraposs Day celebration is based on. Anna Jarvis, dedicated community organiser and philanthropist, campaigned for a day in May to celebrate mums after her own died. The idea gained so much traction by  all US states observed the holiday. In  President Woodrow Wilson declared Mother’s Day a national holiday and a “public expression of love and reverence for the mothers of our country”. She later believed the day had become too focused on profit, and fought for it to become less commercialised. Anna said: “A printed card means nothing except you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world.” Many other countries have followed suit, deciding to celebrate on dferent days . For example, many celebrate on the second Sunday in May - including Finland, Greece, Iceland, India and Italy.

Linda Hardaker, , knew she was suffering with the same condition her mum, aunt and cousins had been for years when she first went to the doctor about her mood swings and painful periods, aged just . But the mum-of-fouraposs concerns were constantly dismissed as a heavy periods, even when at  she was leaving a concert with her pants literally saturated with blood.The florist, from West Derby, finally received a diagnosis for endometriosis at , after being rushed to Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital. She had collapsed and was in unbearable pain from a stabbing, twisting pain in her abdomen, the Liverpool Echo reports. Speaking about the problems around getting a diagnosis, Linda said: You start to doubt yourself. You start to think, aposIs this all in my head  Have I just got a really low pain threshold  Is this normal  Are these normal periods  Is this normal period pain  Am I just exaggerating  Am I just a wimp apos And obviously that affects your mental health. On average it takes seven years from the start of symptoms for people to be diagnosed with endometriosis. The incurable condition - which affection one in  women - sees tissue similar to the lining of the womb growing where in the body, as far away as someoneaposs lungs. It can cause debilitating pains during periods, when the lining sheds and the blood has nowhere to go like it would in the womb. Linda explained how the pains went away while she was on the contraceptive pill and during pregnancy, but came back with a vengeance.She added how she received le-changing treatment from Manou Kaur, a consultant at the Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital, which gave her her le back. Manou gave Linda a full hysterectomy, removing her womb and cervix - using a robotic assisted surgery.  I felt amazing after my surgery, Linda said. Compared to my c-sections, where I was awake and felt groggy, this was so dferent. Following my recovery, I went swimming for the first time and found that I could stretch my body and elongate my torso. Everything felt so stuck together before.

The Derby mum also diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder , which had left her anxious and unable to cope at times.

Emma Cranston was savagely attacked by former partner George Arathoon, who forbade her to wear make-up, forced her to give up her job and manipulated her into thinking she couldnapost live without him. After eventually escaping the relationship, the mum-of-two has since retrained in psychotherapy and formed a friendship with TV therapist Robert Hisee. Emma, , was attacked by her ex-partner Arathoon in February . He was later handed a five-year prison sentence for the assault.Emma told the Manchester Evening News that she met George when he moved into her street in Cheshire in .“George was  years younger than me, but we became pals and it went from there. He was very charming and funny, and I felt I could tell him anything, Emma said. In  they moved in together, but the relationship quickly became volatile and violent. “Each time he managed to convince me it was my fault, he told me I was as bad as him, she said. “I started to think it was wrong to stand up for myself and I began to think I couldn’t live without him. I didn’t see my friends. I didn’t go anywhere without George. “I wasn’t allowed to wear make-up or fake tan or dress up nicely, and in the end, I just gave up. I suppose the fight just went out of me. It was easier to do as I was told.  “I had a good job in a call centre but he made me leave because there were other men there. I was living in a constant state of fear.” In February , George launched an attack that almost killed her. Emma explained: “We had been out for the evening, and I was driving us home. I turned the music up in the car and that was enough to make George flip.” George inflicted injuries so severe that Emma was air-lted to hospital. She suffered multiple broken ribs, and a punctured lung which resulted in blood collecting in between her chest wall and her lung. Doctors also found old healing fractures from earlier attacks. They told Emma she was at risk of a heart attack and was lucky to be alive. She needed surgery to fit metal plates and pins into her back and ribs and had three ribs completely rebuilt. But, despite her ordeal, Emma admits she still had reservations about speaking to the police.  On Valentine’s Day , she finally plucked up the courage to seek justice. George Arathoon was convicted in July  of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, inflicting grievous bodily harm and intimidation. He was jailed for five years at Chester Crown Court. A restraining order was also put in place to stop him from contacting Emma or her family. Emma has since thrown herself into helping other women, setting up a support group, ‘Love Doesn’t Hurt’, which reaches across the globe, with over half a million followers. And earlier this month, she teamed up with Robert Hisee, who will offer his therapies via the support group. Robert, ‘The Hypnotist Man,’ has worked with celebrities like Lauren Goodger, Dame Kelly Holmes, Tom Zanetti, Paul Gascoigne and Gemma Collins, using his own Unconscious Mind Therapy.Emma and Robert, , say they have the support of MPs and hope to be granted charitable status soon. Emma said: “I am so excited to be working with Robert, I have huge admiration for him. I signed up for one of his courses and I have never looked back. So many women I meet have psychological and physical damage and our programme focuses on recovery.” ‘Love Doesn’t Hurt’ offers abuse and trauma recovery using aposunconscious mind therapyapos which promises to help transform thoughts, feelings, emotions , habits and beliefs to help people get over domestic and emotional abuse. Robert said: “We want to create an environment where it is safe to talk and heal – and where they can all help each other too. People need that sort of encouragement and support.

And today will be extra special for Kate as it is Motheraposs Day and no doubt her little ones have some lovely surprises for her when she arrives home. Itaposs also a day when Kate will honour her mum Carole Middleton, and the whole family will also remember Prince Williamaposs late mother Princess Diana. Even though she did not get to meet her grandchildren, William has spoken in the past of how he talks to his children about their granny.And last Motheraposs Day, the youngsters all created cards for Diana - with Princess Charlotteaposs containing a particularly poignant message. Her message was on a fuchsia coloured card with a hand-drawn multi-coloured heart. And in it, she made sure to mention how much her dad William misses his mum. Charlotte wrote: Dear Granny Diana, I am thinking of you on motheraposs day. I love you very much. Papa is missing you. Lots of love Charlotte xxxxxxxxx.

Meanwhile, older brother George used joined-up writing on bright green card to say: Dear granny Diana, Happy happy Motheraposs Day. I love you very much and think of you always, sending lots of love from George xxxxx.And Louis, who was just two at the time, also used green card for his Motheraposs Day card which featured a colourful heart surrounded by several animals - all of which had been stuck on to the card.The cards were posted on the official Twitter account for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge where four images were uploaded, with a heartfelt message. It revealed: Each year on Mother’s Day, George, Charlotte and Louis make cards remembering their Granny, Diana, for William. Whatever your circumstances, we are thinking of you this Mother’s Day. In the  documentary Diana, Our Mother: Her Le and Legacy, William spoke openly saying he is committed to making sure his children know all about their late grandmother. He said wants his kids to “know who she was and that she existed” and told how he “constantly” talks to his children “about Granny Diana” at bedtime so that they know “there are two grandmothers in their lives”. The future king said: “We’ve got more photos up around the house now of her and we talk about her a bit.” He added: “It’s hard because obviously Catherine didn’t know her so she cannot really provide that level of detail, so I regularly put George and Charlotte to bed, talk about her and just try to remind them that there are two grandmothers, there were two grandmothers in their lives. “So it’s important that they know who she was and that she existed.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mothers DayKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrincess CharlottePrincess DianaPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Plans have been drawn up which would see him read his mumaposs Speech on her behalf.It comes as the Prince of Wales takes on an increasing amount of duties from his -year-old mother, The Sun reports. The ceremony takes place on Tuesday, May , with the speech setting out the Government’s agenda for the next session. It will reference plans to grow the economy, cut the cost of living, make streets safer and clear the Covid backlogs.  A statement on the governmentaposs website says: The Queen’s Speech will provide the leadership needed in challenging times to level up opportunities and employment in all parts of the United Kingdom. The current session of Parliament will be prorogued ahead of the speech so security preparations can be made. The likely date of prorogation is yet to be confirmed.  Elizabeth II has only missed it twice in her  years on the throne, when she was pregnant with Andrew and Edward in  and . The Queen will confirm her attendance on the day, with the plan being drawn up amid issues with her general health and mobility.Last month, she caught Covid- but only experienced mild symptoms and continued some light duties at Windsor.  Before then, in her first public appearance since Andrew settled his sex abuse case, she alarmed Royal observers by telling Defence Services Secretary Major General Eldon Millar and his predecessor Rear Admiral James Macleod as you can see, I canapost move, while holding a walking stick and pointing to her leg or foot in a meeting at the castle.Earlier this month it emerged she plans to spend more time at Craigowan Lodge, on her Balmoral Estate, which has had a £, wheelchair-friendly lt fitted.But this week, her unofficial biographer Robert Hardman said she was in “very good spirits” after reports she was now largely confined to using a wheelchair.Get all the royal news and gossip you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersHe said: “Mobility is something of an issue now…I’m told by those very close to her that sheaposs in very good spirits, you know - absolutely pin-sharp as ever. “But there is a mobility issue inevitably when youaposre coming up to your th birthday and also dignity, I think itaposs terribly important.And last year she spent a night in hospital for precautionary checks after cancelling a planned trip to Northern Ireland.

Although the vast majority of schools in England already pass this threshold, around % are open for fewer than  hours per week. Ministers say they want to abolish discrepancies in school opening hours, which are currently decided by headteachers, by . The Government said the change, which starts next September, will ensure children have access to a range of subjects and catch-up support.The new .-hour week is equivalent to an .am to .pm day from Monday to Friday. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said a child who receives  minutes less teaching per day loses out on two weeks of lessons per year.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter He told Sky News: “The average school day is -and-a-half hours. Some schools, thousands of schools are  minutes lower than that – so we want schools to be, sort of, am to .pm. “I’d like them all to do it by the end of this year, but I know some will have logistical problems. Which is why we’ve said by next year.” The minister told the BBC the Government would set out its plans for schools in England in the coming week, with a focus on strong multi-academy trusts.He added The evidence is clear that a family of schools that is really tightly managed, really well supported - especially through Covid - has delivered better educational outcomes for children. So strong - and I underline strong - multi-academy trusts is the infrastructure we need to complete and deliver. However, unions claim the change to school hours will make little impact on students and could even have a negative effect. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: We are unconvinced by the benefits of introducing a minimum expectation on theof the school week of . hours.Adding time on to the school week may sound straightforward, but there are many issues which need to be considered in inidual schools, and we would encourage the government not to rush any changes. Paul Whiteman, of the headteachersapos union the NAHT, said: We hope that during the year before these proposals are implemented, there can be a review of the evidence supporting this plan. Simply adding five or  minutes to a day is unlikely to bring much,any, benefit. The government says it will be guided by evidence - they need to meet that undertaking.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Photos on the listing, which is set to go to auction on March , show that each room is incredibly run-down, with piles of rubbish strewn all over the place. One room shows a pack of Stella Artois on the bedside cabinet which,youaposre lucky, could end up coming with the auctioned property.  The house listing has been shared on social media with a lot of people commenting on its condition. However, estate agents Allsop has reassured potential buyers that the house will be cleared of all rubbish and unwanted items when the sale of the site is completed. With a large overgrown rear garden, the property is situated on the north west side of Maesdu Road, to the south west of its junction with Ffordd Las.  It comes complete with three bedrooms, one bathroom, two reception rooms and a very cluttered kitchen. Clutter inside shows stacks of paper piled up in one corner of the room, a dirty unmade bed and a mould-ridden toilet along with rubbish and bags strewn over the rear overgrown garden floor. Whoever takes on the property will need some serious elbow grease - and a strong stomach.  Allsop auctions say the property will be open for viewing every Monday and Wednesday before the auction. However, the company strongly encourages that all viewers wear a face mask and gloves when viewing the property.They also ask people not to visitthey are displaying symptoms of coronavirus.The three bed end terrace house is located overlooking the large Llandudno Rugby Field and stands only minutes away from the A.  This gives direct links to the A expressway and has an extensive range of local shops and amenities are available within the coastal town of Llandudno.

But it wasnapost the only colourful outfit the -year-old wore during the week, with her wardrobe including lots of bright, bold hues - including yellow, blue, green and orange.Following the tour, a stylist has claimed that Kateaposs colourful outfits might have been a nod to the Queenaposs own wardrobe ethos and praised her for the touching tribute.  Speaking to Femail, Hannah Eichler said: Whether itaposs orange for optimism, blue for confidence, red for love or yellow for warmth, Kate has followed the Queenaposs cue by using colour to invoke powerful feelings of energy amongst herself and her subjects - a key tool when visiting new countries and engaging with those around her. Bright colours have long been favoured by the Royal family but no one has championed the look more so than the Queen herself.As a lover of colour herself, the Duchess has paid homage to the Queen during her tour this week, and while these colourful looks will no doubt get the royal nod of approval, they also make a statement about Kateaposs emotions, too.The Queen is known for having a wardrobe boasting all the colours of the rainbow and is thought to dress to invoke powerful feelings and energy. However, there is one big dference between the way the monarch and the Duchess of Cambridge dress in bright colours. Her Majesty will often pair a matching colourful accessory with her outfits - this is most commonly a hat.  She is also known to have an umbrella to match all of her colourful coats for wet weather, should she need one.But Hannah thinks that by forgoing colourful hats, Kate seems more modern and relaxed - do you agree  Let us know in the comments below.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Snow will begin in the north on Wednesday and is expected to hit Scotland and the northern parts of England. Forecasters say around four inches is expected to lie in some areas.  The flurries will move to move into northern parts of England and could dump up to nine inches in the area, WX Charts says. In Wales, up to three inches will settle later in the week while Northern Ireland is not immune and will see some snow too. Large parts of the country will be hit by rain which will turn to sleet or snow as temperatures plummet. Tomorrow is set to be the last of the mini-heatwave, with temperatures hitting up to C at around pm. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen told The Sun: “Although the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. “On the hills in the north, there’s a chance of this falling as snow, although we’ll gain more certainty on that in the coming days. “With the influence of some unsettled weather, we’ll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north.The Mirror yesterday told of the coming cold snap, which will be shock to the system for those who had started to breakout their summer wardrobe.In some places there has been glorious temperatures of C and C highs, with seemingly endless sunshine. But a cold snap has been forecast by the BBC and WXCharts in Scotland, with snow expected for many areas. Flurries will arrive as early as Wednesday, but forecasters from The Met Office have said below average temperatures should come to an end later in April.BBC forecaster Darren Bett said: “There are some big changes in the weather pattern on the way but not just yet. Temperatures in rural areas will not be far away from freezing.  There maybe a few pockets of frost and fog to start the day across Scotland and Northern Ireland but away from Northern Isles there is set to be more sunshine for Scotland and Northern Ireland on Friday. Plenty of sunshine for England and Wales. Into next week though and this is where we see signicant changes not least because we are going to start to see a northerly wind moving down and that will really drop the temperatures, said Mr Bett. As the high recedes early next week we have got the chance of seeing some rain and then that northerly wind arrives it will be much colder by day and also by night.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeHeatwaveSnowWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Britain has enjoyed a recent string of warm and sunny days, giving us  hope that summer weather was here.In some places there has been glorious temperatures of C and C highs, with seemingly endless sunshine. But meteorologists say sunshine conditions will end this by Saturday or Sunday.People will get a taste of most of the seasons within the space of a few days, a Met Office forecaster has said, as above-average summery weather makes way for more wintry conditions.Clocks go forward overnight into Sunday, ushering in British Summer Time.  In Glasgow, the temperature is due to drop by half, from .C on Saturday to just C by Thursday. Hill snow is likely to affect some parts of Scotland on Tuesday night, and possibly across the Pennines and Welsh mountains by Wednesday, said forecaster Marco Petagna. He said: Weaposll get a taste of most of the seasons within the space of a few days. The UK was bathed in sunshine and blue skies again on Saturday, as a warm and dry spell continued. The mercury reached a high of .C in Porthmadog in Wales, and much of the country is likely to see temperatures in the mid to high teens again on Sunday.  Greater cloud cover across central and eastern England will mean temperatures are down a few degrees, Mr Petagna said. He added: But itaposs still pretty good for the time of year. The average at the end of March would usually only be C or C in the north and -C in the south. So itaposs still pretty good at the start of the week. He said there will be a more notable change from midweek, with Thursday looking likely to be a cold day for most with highs of between C and C. In the Met Officeaposs long-range forecast for the UK, which spans from March  to April , it expects showers to become more prominent, and even says some snow showers may hit northern areas. It reads: Becoming more unsettled to start the period, northern areas will see increasing amounts of cloud with a few showers. Breezy and feeling cooler than recently in the far north, with the potential for some snow showers at low levels. Temperatures near average in the south. Becoming less settled and colder thereafter, with a mixture of sunshine and showers for most, in addition to an increased likelihood of wintry hazards, particularly to the north. Nearer to the end of this period, temperatures are expected to gradually recover to average, though overnight frost remains possible during clearer spells. Showers or longer spells of rain look to become more frequent, with drier periods most likely to be short-lived.

I told him that and it went into this whole conversation about whether I had considered standing up to that or arguing that and I said no because it hadn’t really bothered me.  He said he could tell I was athletic and he could tell that I was a runner. When he first said it I thought it might have been linked to the condition he was coming to talk about. But when I said no I used to be a swimmer he said aposoh yeah I can tell.apos Itaposs not the worst but it was just uncomfortable. As the conversation came to a close he went back to the whole covid conversation and continued to press that. I made it very clear that I wasnapost interested in continuing the conversation.  Then he did this Nazi-style march. He looked down, hunched his shoulders and did a little marching movement. Rachael, who moved from the US to Manchester in  and was working at the uni part-time, claims during the meeting she was told that due to university policy all other CCTV in the area had been wiped. She added: They told me I should prepare for the likely event I wouldnapost be able to move forward with my complaint because there wasnapost sufficient evidence to identy the inidual.  The HR adviser didnapost respond to my email. Instead, in a final meeting he expressed learning about a -day CCTV policy they were unaware of. I was told the CCTV gets wiped after  days. That is very publicly available on the university website and something everyone  seemed to know about. I would expect HR to know about this. By this point it was well over the  day time limit. He expressed his sympathies and regret for not knowing about this policy but he didnapost really show any emotion. He didnapost seem bothered. He told me that the department would use my case as a learning opportunity and that an inquiry into the state of the CCTV camera in the [clinic] would take place. The -year-old was told by the universityaposs HR advisor the member of staff the complaint was levelled against wouldnapost be made aware, which she described as pretty sh***y. Nobody even asked himhe was in [the uni] that day, she said.  I donapost knowthere is an established written record of this because an accusation was never formally brought forward. If it happens again and god forbid it’s worse I have no confidence it’s going to go any other way. That was my primary concern: it’s not about getting anyone in trouble or fired. I do think Iaposve exhausted everything. My bosses are all in complete support so I feel support internally. They are angry and frustrated as well. Policies and procedures are not being followed and I’m glad the only thing that happened was an annoyance for the day. Would this have been taken more seriouslythis was a more serious offence  Why can’t I get some security  I hate the fact heaposs going to get away with it, but I also hate the fact that I donapost feel safe. A Manchester politan University spokesman said: We are sorry that Miss Hearn feels that the investigation process has not been handled correctly. We continue to speak with Miss Hearn about her concerns and we will ensure that she can feel safe and supported when at the University.

Devastated Lucy Hesford-Buckingham lost husband Simon, , on February . Simon had been diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis four years ago and was admitted to intensive care just three weeks after their special day with multiple organ failure.Lucy described Simon as the most giving and caring person Iaposve ever met, WalesOnline reports. The couple met when Lucy was  and Simon . They had remained together ever since. Simonaposs condition deteriorated after a change in medication last year and he spent time in and out of hospital in the last months of his le. The pair were due to marry in December  but postponed the wedding due to Simonaposs illness. I think we always knew it would have an impact on his le, but we didnapost know it would take his le, said Lucy.  Simonaposs liver stopped working due to his condition which in turn had an impact on the rest of his organs. Lucy said that at first it appeared as though his condition was improving. She said: In the coma they brought him off everything to try and wake him up naturally. And he did start to wake up. I was sitting there and he wasnapost able to talk because he had a pipe in his mouth but he was able to shake his head and, you know, we were having quite coherent conversations. But then it all just deteriorated within the space of two days. I have to say they were amazing. All the nurses and the consultants were absolutely amazing to him I canapost fault them. They all came to the funeral as well which was lovely.Until October Simon was coping with his condition well. He was absolutely fine, Lucy said. He was perfect. We were going to the gym all the time. He was the fit one out of the two of us. But then they tried dferent medication - added some more in to seeit would give a good influence - and it all went downhill. The pair, who lived in Crynant, Dulais Valley, married on January  in Craig-y-Nos Castle in what Lucy described as the perfect day. She said that although Simon was ill on the day, it was important for him that they married. It was so nice, it was amazing, said Lucy. Simon was ill on the day and he was kind of resting and to be fair his best man was looking after him all day. But he was there for all the most important bits, he was there for the majority of the time. He was so chuffed that we did it. And I think he would have tried to get well for the first time to have it because he was just so adamant that we were going to get married.  I think part of you will always think aposthey mustaposve known they were going to pass awayapos, so part of me thinks he knew and thataposs why he wanted to get married but you never know do you. She said: When everyone puts their relationship on social media they try to portray it as perfect, but I never felt like I needed to do that because I knew what we had was perfect. So many people came up to me and said that we were more than a couple, we were perfect for each other. Simon was the most giving person you would ever meet. He was so caring. Everyone gravitated towards him because he was so calm. He was a therapist and he had this craft where he could sit there with you, rearrange your thoughts, and get you a better view on le in minutes. It was immaculate the way he would do it.  Lucy said the pair were inseparable and had only spent the evening before the wedding apart in the last six months of his le. She said: I donapost know what Iaposm doing. Itaposs been a month and still day to day I couldnapost tell you what Iaposve done. I think I am going through trauma just as much now as I was then. The way my brain is coping with it is to zone out. Obviously because I was in hospital with him the flashbacks I am having are horric. As soon as it happens I feel like I zone out for what feels like ages.  If someone had said to me when I was put on this world, aposdo you want nine years of perfection with a soul mate or  years of a mundane relationship with someone who fits the billapos I would have picked Simon every time. Right now Iaposm trying to focus on the positive part of it but I know that is going to come crashing down. There is a degree of numbness at the moment. Lucy said they used to enjoy creating YouTube videos and content together and that it is doing nothing together that she will miss the most. We just loved being together. I could go through all the memories of all the things were did together, but the things I think of is just sitting in the house watching TV. I donapost feel like heaposs gone. I know his body is not here but I still feel him around me all the time. Lucy has now started a charity in memory of Simon who had recently completed a degree that would allow him to be a counsellor. She said that Simon was passionate about providing young people who are autistic and neuroergent with accessible therapy, something he struggled to find. Simon worked alongside the Kimel foundation and had undertaken a course with them and they were later going to take him on as a counsellor. Lucy said: Simon just wanted to help people. He said aposwhen I graduate I donapost want to work for money, I feel like Iaposve taken money for something I could do for freeapos. He just wanted to help and would give anything to help someone.Lucy and Simonaposs family would gratefully receive donations in his memory to the Kimel Foundation who will be part of the charity in memory of Simon.

In recent years weaposve seen dferent cake trends emerge, including wheels of cheese being stacked on top of one another and doughnut walls.For one woman, her dream cake combined cake and doughnuts and she thought sheaposd purchased just this after splashing over to have it made. However, what arrived on the day wasnapost exactly what sheaposd been hoping for.

Fellow TikTok users were horried by the clip, with one person replying: Grocery store doughnuts and a one-layer cake, nailed it.Someone  said: Couldnapost even spring for Krispy Kreme smh. A third wrote: A stack of tortillas surrounded by some bagels would have made me happier. I would have been livid.After the first video went viral, garnering over . million views, Sara later posted a follow-up explaining what happened at her wedding. She told viewers: You know something has to go wrong at every wedding and my wedding had three things. One my dress got botched two weeks before my wedding, two my husbandaposs ring showed up the morning of our wedding and three my cake and this is the story of my cake. Okay so there were several red flags before this but Iaposm gonna skip to the week of the wedding when I have this feeling that something is wrong, so I text her like aposHey Iaposm so excited to have the cake at the wedding on Saturdayapos and she text back saying aposgreatapos. Sara said she then checked whether there was anything  the baker needed from her and she said there wasnapost. However, when everyone arrived for the reception, the cake still hadnapost turned up. Eventually, the woman ran in with the cake - then the three-tier stand it was meant to be on broke. Luckily, the venue had a platter and my maid of honour and sister went out and set up this little cake thing which is like all we had. It was a mess, she shared. Sara recalls how she made eye contact with the baker and realised in the moment she had to aposlet it goapos to not let it ruin the day, but she was disappointed theyaposd spent so much money for what they received. Thankfully, they managed to get a full refund after the wedding, so allaposs well that ends well.Do you have a story to share  We want to hearall about it.

Having previously donated his sperm for payment as a struggling student, he decided to go down this route once again, pulling in £which helped see the couple comfortably through to the end of the week.He didnapost see this as a big deal at the time but opted not to tell his we. Until recently, heaposd forgotten about it completely, until a conversation with friends prompted him to bring it up. His we was not happy at this casual revelation and was left distressed by the thought that her husband may well have unknown biological children out in the world. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the conflicted husband reveals he met his we in his final year of college, adding that they have now been married for six years.He wrote: We have our own children and everything is okay but a couple of years ago we went through a rough patch and I donated again to earn some money. I didnapost really tell her because I didnapost see it as a big deal and it wasnapost a lot of money. I got about £to tide us over for the week and we went on about our business. I forgot about it.However, the other week, they were chatting with friends who were experiencing fertility issues, and the topic of his previous donation cropped up, much to his weaposs surprise. The poster - who goes by the username u Spare-Ninja- - continued: My we was more shocked than I expected her to be. She looked visibly shaken but moved on quickly.When we got home she brought it up again and I explained the story and how I forgot about it over time and didnapost see it as a big deal. She got quite upset, saying I might have potential children that I donapost know about. I donapost have children I donapost know about because the only children I have are those Iaposve had with her, but she is insisting this is some form of betrayal. The unnamed man now feels quite guilty about the situation and wonders whether he should have just told his we at the time, realising that to her, this was a pretty big deal. One fellow Reddit user advised: As someone who conceived my children with donor sperm I do still feel you should have disclosed it. They aren’t your children but a lot of these kids grow up with a curiosity about where they came from. In fact, in my country, they have a legal right to their donor’s contact details once they turn  and donors need to sign a form acknowledging that before they can donate. No one is expecting you to be a parent but the chances of a kid popping up to say hi over the years aren’t zero and you should have prepared her for that possibility as a courtesy. Another wrote: At best you were inconsiderate, at worst you violated her trust... what  are you doing that she considers a big deal, that you arenapost sharing  I guarantee that sheaposs been rolling that thought around her head since.Do you have a sperm donation-related story to share  We pay for stories.

However, despite measuring the handle herself, Gemma didnapost give the listing details a thorough read. When it arrived, it was massive. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Having apparently not learned her lesson, Gemma then went on order a replacement doormat, once again failing to read the small print. The product that arrived was just the bristle centre, which is said to be scarcely large enough to fit beath her -year-old partner Antaposs feet.And last week Gemma ordered what she believed to be a large white fluffy rug for her -year-old daughter. However, she was once again left chuckling away after unwrapping the flannel-sized order.Gemma said: All my friends and family think Iaposm an idiot for doing it so many times. The thing is, I measured the door handle exactly before going online so I thought I was buying the perfect replacement. When it arrived it was massive but I was determined to use it. My partner put it on for me and put it on wonky so the cupboard was super irritating. Next we ordered a doormat, not realising that the part we ordered was just the central bit, not it as a whole. It was very problematic for my partner as he has massive feet and I made him wipe them on the tiny matt whenever he came in. She continued: Then it all happened once again when my daughter wanted to buy a rug with her Christmas money and sent me over the Amazon link.Turns out neither of us read the listing properly and thought the one we were buying was what was photographed. We were a bit worried when a very small parcel arrived, and when we opened it, it was like a flannel. However, despite all her purchases arriving in all the wrong sizes, Gemma decided to make use of them anyway, and she says they still managed to do the trick. Gemma said: Iaposve kept them all eventhey are all on the small side. Iaposve learned to love them all as they have character. I’ve paid for it so Iaposm using it, evenI suffer.She has since shared pics of three order clangers to Facebook, in a humorous post that has clocked up  likes and counting.In the caption, Gemma wrote: I have a terrible habit of ordering things online without checking their size. Well, my offspring just ordered herself a rug and looks like she has the same affliction. Gemmaaposs followers have been left in stitches at her all-too-relatable mix-ups, with one person admitting, I do stuff like this all the time. I canapost measure to save my le.

The girlfriend was taken by the pretty cat she spotted in a number of the photos and asked what the family had called it. But she didnapost much like the answer. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the conflicted cat lover wrote: She remarked what a pretty cat it was and asked what her name was. I said it was funny because her name was also Clementine.She immediately got p***ed and asked me what the f**k was wrong with me. I was surprised by this and she started going in on me about how I tricked her into naming our daughter after a dead cat. We argued until she told me to take her home. The whole ride home we didn’t speak. When we got home she went into our room with the baby and hasn’t come out since.The poster - who goes by the username u ihgfgvf - went on to clary that heaposd named his daughter Clementine because he likes the name, not because he deliberately wanted to name her after a long-dead cat.Despite this clarication, many Reddit users feel he should have really given his girlfriend a heads up about the signicance of the name before they decided on Clementine. One person wrote: A lot of people donapost like naming their kids after a dead pet and given how long you had the cat I wouldnapost buy that you simply forgot the connection. You should have told her that you had a cat with the name and then let her decide how she felt about it with all the information. Another said: Instead of being honest about the name and the feelings behind it from the beginning, you purposely hid the fact youaposd had a cat of that name. You wouldnapost have felt it necessary to hide unless you had known it would be an issue, so I would argue itaposs very manipulative to omit that information until after your daughter had already been born and named.Do you have a baby name-related story to share  We pay for stories.

The woman, whose name is Faith, managed to slide out the drawer after realising it had a little piece to push down, and was able to get a proper look at it. Noticing the compartment was looking rather grimy, Faith set about cleaning it using a simple yet effective combo of warm washing up liquid water, a toothbrush, and a cloth. After a lot of scrubbing, Faith was able to get her washing machine drawer sparkling once more, and many have been impressed by the satisfying results. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to the Facebook group Cleaning tips and tricks with before and after pictures of her drawer, an incredulous Faith wrote: How on earth did I not know this drawer came out !I’m not officially an adult and love cleaning haha! Thank you everyone for your cleaning tips and tricks.  Many other members were similarly amazed by the apparently little-known hack, having also had no idea whatsoever that the drawer could be removed and scrubbed separately in this way. One astounded woman wrote: They say you learn something every day. Well, today I learned this thank you. Another gasped: I not know of this trickery either! Offering help to those who werenapost sure how to get their own drawers to budge, ious members whoaposve tried this hack before advised to press down in the middle of the drawer, right where the fabric softener is poured, before giving it a gentle pull.

Veering off script and away from US foreign policy, the President finished a -minute address in Poland yesterday with “For God’s sake, this man [ Vladimir Putin ] cannot remain in power.Within minutes aides were trying to insist he was merely saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over regional neighbours, rather than advocating for regime change. The latter would be at complete odds with the US and NATOaposs stated policy throughout the month-long conflict and risk making an already paranoid President Putin even more dangerous.After the speech, which came at the end of three days of meetings in Europe, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: Thataposs not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere That view was echoed by UK Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi who said the overthrow of Putin for his actions in Ukraine is up to the Russian people. Interviewed on Sunday, Mr Zahawi said it is for the Russian people to decide how they are governed but suggested they would certainly do well to have someone who is democratic and understands their wishes. He told Skyaposs Sophy Ridge: The Russian people, I think, are pretty fed up with what is happening in Ukraine, this illegal invasion, the destruction of their own livelihoods, their economy is collapsing around them and I think the Russian people will decide the fate of Putin and his cronies.  But he declined to criticise Mr Biden, unlike Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, who said Mr Putin will now spin this, dig in and fight harder. AskedMr Biden was wrong to issue the call, Mr Zahawi replied: No, what Iaposm saying to you is the White House has been very clear on this, the President gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the United States and the United Kingdom agree that itaposs up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.  Biden has previously called Putin a “butcher”, “pure thug”, “murderous dictator and, most signicantly, a war criminal. The last comment was at the time dismissed by aides as speaking from the heart but within days US policy changed and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also used the term. That incident led some observers to speculate that Bidenaposs Putin must go comments pre-empt a policy switch. But the rapid back-pedalling and global distancing suggest it was instead the latest example of the -year-old departing from his carefully crafted speeches and misspeaking as a result. President Bidenaposs words came as multiple rockets struck the city of Lviv near the Polish border in the west of Ukraine. He had earlier said: If youaposre able to listen - you, the Russian people, are not our enemy. His comments were condemned by diplomats and foreign policy experts. Richard Haas, a veteran diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Washington Post: “There ought to be two priorities right now: ending the war on terms Ukraine can accept, and discouraging any escalation by Putin. And this comment was inconsistent with both of those goals.“It discourages Putin from any compromise essentially —you’ve got everything to lose, it frees him up. Why should he show any restraint  And it confirms his worst fears, which is that this is what the United States seeks. His ouster and systemic change.” He added that the comments were frustrating as Putin would jump on them and the USapos response to the conflict has so far been incredibly disciplined. David Rothkopf, a foreign-policy analyst and CEO of the Rothkopf Group, said the comments would act as a lightning rod but defended the President saying he wasnapost wrong. Biden, a self-confessed gaffe machine, has previously been criticised for calling Barack Obama “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy at the launch of his  campaign. He was then caught on camera whispering an expletive in Obamaaposs ear at a bill signing. He later drew the then-Presidentaposs ire when he broke rank announced his support for same-sex marriage before it became official policy.And during his own campaign he called Theresa May Margaret Thatcher.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Joe BidenVladimir PutinUkraineRussiaRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and could communicate with aliensBaba VangaByGraeme Murray:,  Mar |commentsA blind mystic who foresaw the Russian war in Ukraine predicted Putin would become aposLord of the Worldapos Baba Vanga apossawapos may natural disasters and warned about conflicts before they happened. She died in the mid s aged , but the Eastern European hinted at what we could expect in the future and became known as aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos.It has now been suggested she predicted Vladimir Putin and Russia will dominate the world. In a meeting with writer Valentin Sidorov, Vanga in , BirminghamLive reported she said: “All will thaw, asice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia.Too much it is brought in a victim. Nobody can stop Russia. All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world. ” Before her death, Vanga predicted glorious future for Russia once more, the Daily Post reported.According to the clairvoyant, Russia will be the world’s only superpower. She also made a chilling prophecy about the use of nuclear weapons and World War . Blinded after being picked up by a freak tornado as a child, Baba Vanga - born Vangelia Gushterova - believed she had the ability to foresee the future. She reportedly made hundreds of predictions in her -year career. She shot to prominence after accurately predicting the sinking of the Kursk in . Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and being able to communicate with aliens.  Her numerous predictions about world events and the state of humanity have become infamous, including claims she predicted the rise of ISIS and the fall of the Twin Towers.The Irish Mirror also told of her chilling predictions today and how some of them have come true.Specialists have since calculated that  per cent of her prophecies had happened - slightly less than the  per cent claimed by her followers. These are some of her other previous predictions: The Kursk nuclear submarine disaster In  the blind prophetess predicted that in August of , “Kursk will be covered with water and the whole world will weep over it.” Kursk was a Russian sub that Sank in the Barents Sea on August , , killing all aboard.  In  Baba Vanga said: “Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.” On September , , planes hijacked by Islamic extremists hit the World Trade Center in New York, killing thousands of people. Europe will cease to exist According to Baba Vanga, the continent will cease to exist by , and all that would remain will be empty spaces and wasteland, nearly devoid of any form of le. Clearly not exactly right, but the UK did vote to leave the EU on June , , creating a lot of turmoil. She is reported to have said that chemical weapons would be used by extremists against Europe . Barack Obama will be the last president of the US Baba Vanga had predicted that the th US president would be an African American, but she had also added that he would be the last one. She claimed he would leave office at a time when the country would be in economic ruins, and there would be a huge ide between the northern and southern states – as was the case during the American Civil War.Baba also appeared to predict that the th president of the United States - who we now know to be Donald Trump - would be faced with a crisis which would “bring the country down”.Her chilling prediction states: “Everyone will put their hopes in him to end it, but the opposite will happen he will bring the country down and conflicts between north and south states will escalate.” Some speculate the references to “north and south” could mean North and South Korea. World War III Baba’s predictions have been revisited after another mystic, who apparently foretold Donald Trump’s presidency, claims to know the exact date World War  will start. Self-proclaimed ‘messenger of God’ Horacio Villegas believes nuclear war will break out on the th anniversary of the visitation of Our Lady of Fatima. The clairvoyant claims to have envisioned Trump would win the US election as far back as . He reportedly predicted the billionaire businessman would become the “illuminati king” who will “bring the world into WW ”. The  Boxing Day Tsunami “Cold regions will become warm ... and volcanoes will awaken. “A huge wave will cover a big coast covered with people and towns, and everything will disappear beneath the water. Everything will melt, just like ice.” China rises According to the prophetess, China will become a world power in . She’s probably out a few years here as China is already an economic and military powerhouse. We’ve also apparently got a change in the Earth’s orbit to look forward to some time before . A golden age A new energy source will be created and global hunger will start to be eradicated between  and . A manned spacecraft to Venus will be launched. From  to  the polar ice caps will melt, causing ocean levels to rise. Cloning of organs Baba Vanga’s predicted that body organs will be cloned by , and that would be the easiest method of treatment. Red and green Between  and  a classless, Communist society will thrive hand in hand with newly-restored nature. Mars attacks! A LOT happens from  to , including a Mars colony becoming a nuclear power and demanding independence from the earth, the establishment of an underwater city and the discovery of something “terrible” during the search for alien le. Some time between  and  we’ll crack time travel. Meanwhile, French guerrillas fight the Muslim authorities in France. The “secrets of the moon” will be unveiled. The end of the world By , everything on Earth will cease to exist. However, humans will be advanced enough to move to a new star system.

And the the Tesla Bot - first unveiled by Musk’s company in August  - could be in production as soon as next year he claims.Optimus, described by Musk as as the “most important development”, will start out in le as a worker droid but its possibilities mean one day brain s may be able to be downloaded into it, once the technology is available.Musk, , told BusinessInsider : “Optimus is a general purpose, sort of worker-droid. The initial role must be in work that is repetitive, boring, or dangerous. Basically, work that people donapost want to do. Would you download your personality onto a robot  Have your say in the comment section “Optimus will be helpful with respect to dropping growth rates. Butthese things continue, then what happens  Humanity dies out. Is that what we want  “We could download the things that we believe make ourselves so unique. Now, of course,youaposre not in that body anymore, that is definitely going to be a dference, but as far as preserving our memories, our personality, I think we could do that. “Weaposve already amplied our human brains massively with computers. It could be an interesting ratio to roughly calculate the amount of compute that is digital, ided by the amount of compute that is biological.”  He added he was excited by the technology, but that there was some “trepidation” with the robots. Musk added: “With respect to AI and robotics, of course, I see things with some trepidation. “Because I certainly donapost want to have anything that could potentially be harmful to humanity. But humanoid robots are happening. Look at Boston Dynamics. They do better demonstrations every year. “The rate of advancement of AI is very rapid.”  Standing at about ft in tall and weighing  pounds, the Tesla Bot will be able to pick up essentials from shops as well as help fix cars with a spanner. Speaking last year at its unveiling, Musk said the robot could have a big impact across the world. The tycoon said: “Tesla is arguably the world’s biggest robotics company, our cars are basically semi-sentient robots on wheels. It kind of makes sense to put that technology on a humanoid form. We think weaposll probably have a prototype sometime early next year. Itaposs intended to be friendly, of course, navigate through a world built for humans, and eliminate boring, repetitive, dangerous tasks.

The US President blasted Putin as a dictator in a stirring speech at theRoyal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.It comes after years of claims that Putin is desperate to re-establish Russian control over former Soviet Union countries.Biden denounced the despot after speaking to Ukrainian refugees in the Polish capital today.When asked what he thought of Putin after the meeting, the President said: Heaposs a butcher.In his speech outside theRoyal Castle, Biden added: In this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today - never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid. A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a peopleaposs love for liberty.Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refused to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.We will have a dferent future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities. For Godaposs sake, this man cannot remain in power.  The White House later claried that Biden was not discussing regime change in Moscow. Instead he was emphasising that Russia should not be allowed to control its neighbours, a US official said. Biden also addressed the Russian people in his speech today, saying aposyou are not our enemyapos while warning that the Kremlinaposs actions in Ukraine was aposnotof a great nationapos Biden added: Of all people, you the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the s and s, the situation of World War Two, still fresh in the mind of many grandparents in the region.  After sharing accounts of the horrors of World War Two, he added: These are not memories of the past - not any more, itaposs exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now. The US president said Moscowaposs troops have met their match with brave and stf Ukrainian resistance and have strengthened the resolve and unity of both the defending forces and the West. Russia wanted less of a Nato presence on his border but now he has a stronger presence, a larger presence, he said.  Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Mr Biden said , Russians had left their country in a single month in a remarkable brain drain as Mr Putin, who he earlier called a butcher, had strangled democracy.Addressing the thousand-strong audience that included refugees who have fled the war, he told Ukrainians we stand with you - period as he defended the nationaposs president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Putin has the gall to say heaposs denazying Ukraine. Itaposs a lie, itaposs just cynical - he knows that, Mr Biden said. And itaposs also obscene. President Zelensky was democratically elected, heaposs Jewish, his fatheraposs family was wiped out in the Nazi holocaust and Putin has the audacity - like all autocrats before him - to believe that might will make right.

It comes two weeks after a previous Russian attack on Kharkivaposs Institute of Physics and Technology, which is home to a nuclear reactor core. A Ukrainian politician warned that the latest shelling risked a aposmajor environmental disasterapos.The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said: The continuation of its bombardment can lead to severe radiation consequences with contamination of nearby territories. Emine Dzheppar, Ukraineaposs first deputy minister of foreign affairs, added: The Russian aggressor fired rocket aposGradapos systems on the territory of the Kharkiv Institute, where the nuclear installation aposSource of Neutronsapos is located, in the active zone of which  fuel nuclear cells were loaded.The destruction of a nuclear facility and nuclear material storage facilities could lead to a major environmental disaster. Ukraine continues to gather evidence ofwar crimes to The Hague. The regulator previously accused Russia of committing an act of nuclear terrorism by bombing the research facility. In a statement the nuclear watchdog said: Prior to the Russian aggression, the Source of Neutrons was at the stage of physical start-up, during which the core was loaded with fresh nuclear fuel.  On February , , the unit was transferred to a deep subcritical state by the operational personnel of the Source of Neutrons. In a report on the state of the reactor, which is used in scientic research at the institute, the Inspectorate said critical buildings at the site had sustained damage during the attack but the reactor was in a deep subcritical state and completely de-energized. Video from the scene is understood to show huge flames at the centre, where the first development of a nuclear bomb was carried out in the USSR.  Ukraineaposs Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security posted on Twitter: In Kharkiv, eyewitnesses report a fire in the building of Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology. The building contains equipment which,damaged, can lead to radioactive pollution of the environment. After it was first targeted, authorities said the institute is home to a nuclear research facility with  nuclear fuel cells.  Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Before Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, while Vladimir Putin ’s troops gathered on the border, Kharkiv was seen as one of the cities most at threat and it has withstood horric bombings and slaughter. The resistance of the city has typied the response from Ukrainians since Russia’s invasion on February  and residents have refused to surrender. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said hundreds of buildings, many residential, had been destroyed. It is impossible to say that the worst days are behind us, we are constantly being bombed, he said. A witness in the city said she saw people on the roofs of apartment buildings dropping grenades or similar ordnance onto the streets as the resistance continues.

Karis Wilson was told her knee- black dress with lace trim over a long-sleeve white turtleneck reminded a female teacher of “lingerie” and made a male student teacher feel awkward, when she wore it to school.The -year-old was sent home and the encounter was so damaging she did notto school until her graduation at the end of the year.Her father Christopher Wilson initially complained about the incident on aFacebooklive video that went viral, with more than , views. He told the Daily Star : She wasnapost wearing it in a sexual manner. She wasnapost wearing it for attention. She normally wears track pants and a hoody. She had a snowboarding accident a month or two ago and couldnapost be active for a while. She had started going to the gym and feeling better about herself. Then one day she decided to wear a dress and feel good about herself, this is how they reacted. “She had lost more than a week of school and then she said ‘dad, I don’t know what to wear to school’. “She elaborated a little bit and said, ‘DadI wear just my track pants and hoodie,I wear something comfortable, am I conforming  “aposIf I wear something I feel pretty in, am I trying to rub it in their face ’”  Karis, a student at NorKam Secondary School in British Columbia, Canada, has now put the incident behind her and started her university education. Her dad told CBC News at the time:was told that it could possibly make the male student teacher feel awkward and it could makefeel awkward since it reminded her of a lingerie outfit. Itaposs actually a very modest outfit when you actually look at it... I think the initial comments were based on the fact that it had lace.” It was said in  that dad Christopher was told the teacher was a little bit old school after complaining to the principal.He said a teacher pulled Karis out of her class and escorted her to the principalaposs office on Tuesday. He claimed the principal later told him that she agreed the outfit was not inappropriate. Karisapos classmates staged a walkout the following day to show their support for her. At the time he added: There was a female who was singled out because what sheaposs wearing could make someone in a position of power over her feel uncomfortable. And the more you think of it, the more you say it, the more you understand that this is absurd.He initially complained about the incident in a live Facebook video that went viral, with more than , views.And now, speaking to the Daily Star in , Christopher said his daughter was confident thatshe could go back in time and change anything, she would do the same thing again.

They then happened to bump into each other on a night out and realised how much they clicked. The pair soon fell in love and married in February . They now have plans to start a family together in the future. Savanna’s family have been supportive, with her mum, who is just seven years older than Mark, even calling him her son. Love who you love and don’t be swayed by others, Savanna said. I am so grateful for the friends I lost to this relationship. At the end of the dayyour friends donapost support you no matter what, they aren’t friends worth having. “Both of our parents were completely fine [with our relationship].My mom calls him son and she’s only seven years older than Mark . He’s really close with my family and vice versa.” From the minute they met, Savanna says she felt dferent about Mark compared to other boyfriends and their relationship quickly grew. She said: “I actually wasn’t physically attracted to my previous boyfriends and wasn’t intimate with any of them. Donapost get me wrong, they are lovely, wonderful guys and I am still great friends with them but physically there was no attraction – despite other girls my age always liking them.“I guess with Mark what’s really incredible is having a physical attraction to him as well as the depth of conversation we can have. It feels like we are teammates as well as lovers, just constant support on both ends to be who we are and true to ourselves.” Although neither Mark nor Savanna had been in a relationship with an age gap before, they never felt it was an issue. She said: “Our relationship just moved from stage to stage naturally with no verbal confirmations. “Neither of us brought it up with the other. We didn’t really voice any concerns. I guess I had in the back of my mind that he may not think I am in the right stage of my le to be serious but we both gave it a shot and we found us both to be in the same stage and in agreement with where and how we were.” After they got together, Savanna introduced Mark to her family and luckily it went really well.But other relationships have suffered because she chose to be with him, including close friendships. She said: “His friends were fine and wonderful and a lot of them are actually some of my best friends now. “My friends in the main were great but I lost two of my best friends because they couldn’t understand that you can get along and be from dferent generations and I guess they had conservative small-minded views of relationships. “I have always deemed myself lucky to have lost them as I donapost believe friends are real friendsthey don’t support you regardless of their own view – we have dferent lives and should support each other regardless of our own opinions.” In late , they decided to get married. Savanna said: Neither one of us is overly romantic and he had been asking stating we should get married for about a month in late  and I just laughed it off every time. One day we were on our way to play lawn bowls with our friends and we were at our favourite cafe called the Tennyson Bistro in Napier, New Zealand, eating smoked salmon bagels and he just said aposPick a date and letaposs get marriedapos.  I laughed and said a random date and he agreed and four months later we were married. The pair had a small wedding with just their closest friends and family on  February , on the balcony of their home. Now, the couple have plans to expand their family at some point in the future. Savanna said: “We are both into the idea of having children but are in no rush. As always we have to plan and discuss everything we do so we have pencilled it in for four years. “For now, we want lots of adventures, travel and success. We have already moved across the country and then moved countries twice now and we would like to keep doing that – exploring and finding opportunities to grow together. Le should be an adventure and settling down doesn’t have to mean staying in one place.” The pair also post about their relationship on TikTok, where they have over , followers. While most of the comments they get are positive, the pair say they do get a few negative responses – but they don’t let it bother them. Savanna said: Itaposs wonderful because we [get] hundreds of messages from people who are in the same boat but donapost have our confidence, and say our TikTok makes them feel better about their relationship. We are helping people ignore the judgement.There are sort of generic comments which makes me think people don’t really think too deeply and repeat what they’ve seen on Facebook. Itaposs just things like “this is so wrong” and “He could be your dad!”I just sit there trying to mature and not comment back aposcould be your dad next time Sharonapos.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement.

time almost all year longa planning bid from a Berwickshire caravan park owner is rubber-stamped.Planning approval was granted by Scottish Borders Council to applicant Chris Gregg for the Coldstream Holiday Park at Kelso Road in December  and the facility opened in the spring of last year.The go-ahead for the caravan and camping park incorporated the change of use of agricultural land and for vehicle access roads, parking and car charging points.But one of the conditions of approval was that occupation of the caravans was “restricted to genuine holidaymakers only staying a maximum of six months in total within any consecutive period of  days commencing on January .”The council’s view was that a permanent residential site at the location “would conflict with established planning policy for this rural area”.That has put the caravan site at a disadvantage compared to other holiday parks in the Borders which are allowed to operate for longer periods, according to Mr Gregg.The new application requests that the maximum period is extended to  months of the year.The reasoning behind requesting the iation is to allow Mr Gregg’s holiday park to operate on a ‘level playing field’ with other similar facilities in the Scottish Borders area, and also to encourage as many holidaymakers as possible to visit Coldstream and the surrounding areas throughout the year.A report submitted with the application, from Melrose-based MFA architects, says: “In reality, the overwhelming majority of holidaymakers will choose to holiday for much less than  months of the year.“However, the fundamental point is that,a holiday maker is buying a caravan, they will naturally wish as much choice as possible on holiday periods and time-scales throughout the year, rather than have holiday periods and time- scales imposed upon them by a planning permission condition.“Chris Gregg is rightly concerned that anyone considering purchasing a holiday caravan in the Scottish Borders will actively consider a holiday site that has no holiday time periods or restrictions over a holiday site that does..remove“Mr Gregg is aware of very recent planning permissions at Lilliardsedge caravan

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model – all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback, we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Suggestions have recently been made that the issue should be make-or-break for candidates in May#s council elections.Islay community councillor Calum Murray, a former teacher, said: #My feeling is to nip this in the bud, that with the elections coming up very soon in May, we should ensure that not one councillor is re-elected that would support this measure.#"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils u13s in football action","story":"Campbeltown Pupils stravelled to Clydebank to play BSC Glasgowon Sunday March , looking to follow-up on their draw with Busby the previous week.After a promising start, the Pupils found themselves - down at half-time, through a combination of poor defending, and also some good play from the BSC attackers.The young Campbeltown team rallied in the second half, and with a much better all-round performance, capped off with goals from Ryan Johnston and Ben Cunningham.Finnart #s The young Pupils# second away game in a row saw them travel on Sunday to play league leaders Finnart.The first  minutes saw the Pupils put in one of their best performances of the season, competing in every position, and they were rewarded midway through the half with a brilliant -yard strike from Ryan Johnston that found the top corner.The pace and strength of the league leaders# attackers started to cause problems, however, and two quick-fire goals gave Finnart the lead.The crucial goal came with the last kick of the half, with slack defending from the Pupils allowing Finnart to go into the break - ahead.The second half was a very even affair.

I had slowly started to think that it was a once-in-a-letime opportunity until fortune smiled upon me one more time.About two weeks ago, I had a busy day at work. To recharge my batteries, I decided to go on a quick walk with the camera.Short-eared owl. Image: Zan BlaszczykAs soon as I left the house, the weather changed its course and the sky was shortly covered by nimbus clouds. Normally I wouldhome and grab my raincoat, but I did not want to waste time.When I arrived at the local reserve, the first rain droplets fell on the ground and the place became deserted. I took a wander and soon spotted a familiar flight pattern above the marshes. Upon checking through my camera, I confirmed it was a short-eared owl.The bird was flying low and patrolling the ground for voles. It even managed to catch one but it was tricky to get a good-quality photo due to the distance between us. The bird flew past me on a couple of occasions but the weather was getting worse with every minute so I headed back home. The word about the owl must have spread, as when I ed two days later, I met other fellow photographers looking for the stunning bird.I ed to the same spot as previously and sat on a rock and waited patiently. Shortly afterwards, a graceful owl with a wingspan of around cm appeared on the horizon. Without changing my position, I started following the bird with the camera. Imagine my surprise when the owl flew over me and looked straight at the camera! I silently shouted to myself: “Wow!”As soon as the owl flew behind me, I slowly turned back and spotted the second bird. Both owls were flying towards each other and, as they met halfway, they started their ‘sky dance’.The male began to rise in the sky whilst performing a combination of dynamic wing beats and gliding down, then rising again. He also made several squeaky calls accompanied by dynamic wing claps at high speeds! After repeating the whole sequence a few times, he started falling from the sky. The female joined in and they started going at each other: the birds were e-bombing one another and attacking with their talons. That aerial display lasted for about  minutes until the birds separated. What a scene it was!Courtship behaviour is spectacular for this species: often, two birds will lock their talons and, whilst holding onto each other, they will start tumbling nearly to the ground before letting go.I encourage everyone who has a chance to observe this behaviour, as this is a ‘must’ in the birding world. It is worth remembering, though, that this species is sensitive to disturbance and their numbers are considered declining during the past two decades. It is crucial not to approach the owls or their nesting site. For your observation, I would recommend choosing one spot and remaining there. This way, you have a chance to show them that you are no threat to them and hopefully the owls will get used to your presence. I prefer this technique rather than hiding as, considering owls’ excellent eyesight, it is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. By waiting at the same position, we can also eliminate another factor, which is chasing off their prey: as we walk, the ground shakes under our feet and small mammals, such as mice or voles which the owls feed on, will disappear. Short-eared owls like marshy and boggy places, so it is important not to walk over the rich habitat but use paths.www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lensIf you have owls living in your backyard or would like me to photograph and feature wildle from your area, please get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-musselburgh-children-star-bugsy-malone","story":"Youth acting group Drama Mill auditioned  children for the show, and now has a cast of  children from North Berwick, Aberlady, Gullane, Cockenzie and Haddington, aged from eight to .Linda Kearsley Ross, Drama Mill director, said that the performance – the group’s first foray into musical theatre – was “ambitious” but that the children had loved taking on the roles of s New York gangsters.County children to star in Bugsy MaloneShe added: “Bugsy Malone was our first choice of play.“Drama facilitators Claudia Overton and Stephanie Wynne and I have all taken part in productions when we were at school and have fond memories of performing this play.“It’s ambitious to do it with such a young castbut our fabulous talented group have risen to the task.“This is the first time we have performed at The Brunton and we are so excited to give our youngsters the opportunity to perform on a professional stage.”The cast will perform the famous musical numbers accompanied by a live nine-piece band, whose members are all volunteering their time and talent.Drama faclitator Stephanie Wynne coaches the young Bugsy Malone castAnd the production will emulate the original  film, starring Jodie Foster, by using splurge guns and foam pies.Linda said: “There is something really fun about playing gangsters and molls, and using splurge to take people down rather than bullets.“Some people criticised that the ending is really abrupt, i.e. that they all become friends and sing a song, but I don’t think children question the ending – they believe bad people can become good people and that, as the words say, ‘ you give a little love then it all comes back to you’.”Tickets can be bought via    or thebrunton en-GB shows bugsy%malone events -

Ruins, writes Green in this gripping travelogue cum history of Britain’s disappeared places, “are at once of their time, yet derailments of it, too, bringing the singularity – and fragility – of the present into stark focus”.Nowhere exemplies the illusion of permanence and the hopelessness of fighting back against the relentless march of timebetter than Dunwich, the Suffolk city that fell off a clf.Dunwich, which was once Suffolk’s main port with a fleet of its own on the North Sea, became a ruin “incrementally” from the Middle Ages to the th century, with the last of its  churches crashing into the sea “amid a waterfall of dead men’s bones” in . Knowing this, we read with the headshaking smugness of those afforded hindsight by long remove of bequests made to shore up another church that teetered on the clf edge  years earlier or to erect a statue in a place of worship that “would barely exist at all” by the time of the bequeather’s death.The American-born author Henry James was one of a “flock of writers, artists and poets” who travelled to Dunwich to wallow in its “power of sadness”. “It was a dreamy, gentle place to live or visit, its violent destruction kept at a safe remove,” writes Green. “They did not have to contend with entire neighbourhoods crashing into the sea, along with parish churches.”This need for distance helps explain why the two shadowlands in Green’s book that are located in Scotland – Skara Brae and St Kilda – evoke quite dferent emotions. The oldest of the abandoned places that Green explores, Skara Brae is at a comfortable remove of millennia from us. We can view its turfed remains, which conceal “the swaddling cloth of muck” that its Neolithic inhabitants smeared around their homes and the warren of passageways that connected them, with disinterested inquiry, just as we might potter around the ruins of Pompei largely untroubled by weeping for the fate of the long-gone settlement’s residents.St Kilda is a dferent matter. The evacuation of this Atlantic isle  miles west of North Uist on  August  is only just outside living memory, the last St Kildan having died in . There are photographs of the St Kildans, or Hirtans, as the Gaelic-speaking islanders might better be called, gathered in the bay in their finery. Their lives, though unlike ours, are sufficiently recognisable for it to be almost impossible to read Green’s account of their departure from a vertiginous lump of rock that had been inhabited for  years – before which they drowned their beloved dogs in the sea – without empathy.“HMS Harebell loomed on the horizon like a ghost rig. The corpses of some of the islanders’ dogs were bobbing in the water, pecked at and nibbled by the gulls. The islanders were stolid, reconciled to an uncertain future, standing in the freezing air, waiting.”Closer still in time is the drowning in  of the village of Capel Celyn in Wales to create a reservoir for the city of Liverpool. Village resident Eurgain Prysor Jones was nine when this bastion of Welsh language, culture and tradition was “turned into a frightening alien domain with lorries and machines incessantly digging up the earth and throwing up enormous clouds of dust” as the groundwork for the annihilating reservoir was laid. Who can read of the filling of that hated articial lake, when the roar of millions of gallons of water drowned out “the rousing tones of ‘Land of My Fathers’ in a monstrous, obliterative gush”, without a stirring of the soul Capel Celyn is not the only settlement in Shadowlands to have been erased by politicians rather than the forces of nature. The cluster of villages in the Stanford Training Area in Norfolk disappeared into a fenced-off military zone in , and the evictees were never allowed toto their homes. The deserted mediaeval village of Wharram Percy lost much of its population during the Black Death when “many thought they were soaking up the last glimmers of the universe’s existence”, but that was not what finished the village off. In , the landowner began to evict the remaining residents to make way for sheep, creating in Wharram Percy “a perfect microcosm of what happening nationwide”, as a kind of English Clearances took hold.Green is an historian, and Shadowlands is both meticulously researched and vividly imagined. The author has a novelist’s gt for bringing the past alive. When the king visits Wincha, the Sussex port that was moved at the end of the th century as the sea encroached, the reader is there among the “tumblers, jugglers and minstrels”, eyeballing the “apple-sized meatballs imprisoned in great mounds of jelly”.Just occasionally, Shadowlands slips into sounding a bit like a geography textbook, but overall, it is a thought-provoking and satisfying exploration of vanished places and the enduring forces that put them to the sword: war, pestilence and climate change. As the Russian army lays waste to Ukraine, making the fragility of the present horribly manest, it feels strangely prescient.“At St Kilda, I saw a vision of the sort of brutally self-sufficient society to which humanity might regress in the wake of environmental collapse, a third world war or some other, unforeseen catastrophe,” writes Green at the end of his splendid book. With small towns being erased in Ukraine even as I write, that apocalyptic vision begins to feel less like poetic conjecture and more like a real possibility."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-hairspray-back-burst-cabaret-pantomime-musical-hall-comedy","story":"But Hairspray is right up there with them as one of the most provocative pieces of political theatre ever to be unleashed.Yes, I know what you’re thinking this Sixties pastiche is a pop fest of cabaret, pantomime and musical hall comedy. And all of that is true. But the poignant storyline is so wonderfully weaved throughout we are almost unaware that what we’re watching is the birth of a social revolution.While young people twist and shake the tectonic plates are shting in America for good.Set in Baltimore, dance-loving teen Tracy Turnblad auditions for a spot on The Corny Collins Show – and wins. She becomes an overnight, but overweight celebrity, a trendsetter in dance, fun and fashion. But Tracy realises there is something seriously wrong young black people are denied representation on the show. What can she do about it Just to make Tracy’s voice all the harder to hear, she is a plus-size young woman who doesn’t have the glamour that would have guaranteed her attention.And she’s also up against her plus-size mom, who is far from radical. Indeed, Edna Turnblad’s dream is that her daughter follows her into the laundromat business. “Dancing is not your future,” she says to Tracy. “One day, youre going to own Ednas Occidental Laundry.”“I dont want to be a laundress. I want to be famous.“ If you want to be famous, learn how to take blood out of car upholstery. Thats a skill you can take right to the bank.”But Tracy persists. She determines to bring racial integration to the show. And to America. And along the way we’re treated to a range of characters that threaten to look like panto villains but never quite make it because there’s a reality to them, we can’t ignore.Yes, there’s a sentimentality to the book that threatens to soak our eyes, but it doesn’t, because we can understand the intent in showing that young people really are capable of changing the world.Right now, there are young people in Ukraine and Russia doing exactly that, desperate to fight off the forces of evil and create a new order.And although Hairspray will guarantee a fun night, one of the best in a theatre, what it always does is provoke and make us realise what we take for granted.Theatre also reminds that change can come. Sometimes not as quickly as we’d like. And the Putins of this planet believe themselves to be entrenched.As right-wing TV host Corny Collins boasts, sarcastically “Gee, Velma, how do you fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collins Show ”But Velma has the perfect reply and deadpans “They do it all the time on Lassie.”Hairspray, The King’s Theatre, Glasgow, March -April .Theatre for Ukraine at the TronTHEATRE isn’t simply about staging and performance, it’s about connecting. Supporting.There is little doubt that most of us get to see only what goes on when the curtain is lted. We don’t appreciate, for example, that the West End show The Book of Mormon had to use  cover actors on stage recently because of the blight of Covid.Or indeed, few appreciate the irony the Tron Theatre had to endure, coming back from Covid with fabulous theatre football success story in Moorcroft, only to see it kicked off the park by the virus.What we don’t appreciate either is the Tron Theatre’s efforts to get  actors on stage on March  for a staged reading of a Ukrainian play The Grain Store – all the actors will be paid or they will donate their fees to Ukraine – and all box office income going to the main Ukraine appeal.Artistic Director Andy Arnold says: “It’s a brilliant play and very appropriate for the occasion is essential that we have a full house – not only to raise as much money as we can for the Ukraine but writer Natal’ia Vorozhbit, has sent me a letter to read out on the evening of our reading.“She and her -year-old daughter have had to flee their home. The last paragraph of her letter reads ‘Russian troops have almost encircled my wonderfully green and beloved Kyiv in order to turn it into ruins. My friends are still there and my relatives, my beautul apartment, my daughter’s school. Her father, a writer, is also there, defending the city with a weapon in his hands.’Theatre can make a dference.Tickets can be bought on the Tron Theatre What’s On webpage.Also, this week.

Are we living in the same dimension Bearing in mind the recent opinion polls that suggest the Tory vote is going backwards either Mr Ross cannot understand statistics and therefore shouldn’t be in politics, orhe can understand statistics that’s even more reason he shouldn’t be in politics. Perhaps he should concentrate on running up and down on the sidelines in as a minor official in football matches taking instructions from his boss in the middle of the big game mind you that’s what he does at Holyrood. Perhaps he is suffering from stress and needs a break from the rigours of being king of a very wee castle, poor soul.David J Crawford, Glasgow.rUK SHOULD BUILD ITS OWN NUCLEAR BASEDR Jonathan Eyal uses a misquote to attack Nicola Sturgeon on no-fly zones . She statedthat a no-fly zone should not be taken off the table, not that one should be instituted a dference in emphasis perhaps too subtle for Dr Eyal to follow.Defence Minister James Heappey has suggested a chemical attack would cross a “red line” but the West has allowed Russia to use these weaponswith impunity before, and any Nato reaction would also risk a nuclear confrontation. The real virtue signalling was the signing of the Budapest Memorandum where the UK and the USguaranteed Ukraine its sovereignty, but then reneged in .Dr Eyal also thinks an independent Scotland should host nuclear weapons on behalf of the former UK. Could I remind him that the submarines, missiles and warheads are entirely built, maintained and refitted outside Scotland  If an exceptional treaty obligation similar to the Budapest Memorandum was again signed by the former UK, then Scotland could find itself in the firing line, even though it had no dog in the fight. I suggest to Dr Eyal thatLondon wishes to maintain its status as a nuclear power, then it should be building a submarine base, warhead storage facility and loading jetty somewhere within its own territory.GR Weir, Ochiltree.BREXIT IN OPERATIONNOBODY should be surprised at the behaviour of the parent company of PO Ferries towards its UK employees .

You would have been better saying just \"anti-Israeli\" . You ignore the fact that Israel has already killed  Palestinians this year, two juveniles, and \"detained\" hundreds.Meanwhile, having made two contributions to Ukrainian appealsand favouring further sanctions and arms for Ukraine, I note that Ukraine has consistently backed Israel against the Palestinians. Perhaps Ukraine will have some idea now what its been like to be in Gaza too often.Bob Philip, Falkirk.NO NEED TO PAD NEWS BULLETINSSINCE March  ITV News has been a one-hour weekday bulletin from .pm. Many welcomed this development as ITV, with nothing like the resources of BBC or Sky News, has a well-deserved reputation for exclusives and insightful reporting. It was the TV broadcaster which exposed the mock Downing Street press conference during the Christmas season and, later, the Partygate one last April on the eve of Prince Philips funeral.This is the biggest ITV News expansion in  years. It is pouring millions into the project with  new journalists, producers, camera operators and video operators. It is having new correspondents for Scotland and Wales, is producing more content outwith London, and has the base of a . million audience, the most popular commercial TV news service. It is impartial and independent and not so easily leaned on by the UK Conservative Government.The problem, so far, has been the fact that the one-hour bulletin has had very blatant padding. One obvious case is the weather which has now been dumbed down to a song and dance segment. The public wants a detailed analysis of UK weather. Gone is academically-qualied meteorologist Lucy Verasamy, replaced by rather Marmite presenter Alex Beresford, who chunters on, unnecessarily, about lambing, the Northern Lights or even the weather abroad.There is no need for padding. In Israel it could examine the Family Reunication Law, one of the most racist and discriminatory laws in the world affecting , Palestinians. Or it could highlight the draconian laws by Israel to steal Palestinian land, illegal under the Oslo Agreement .It could cover North Korea, which has stepped up launching parts of an ICBM, prohibited by the UN. It will soon have one which can reach the US.Then there is Iran, which regularly fires ballistic missiles as a warning to Israel, but only the one landing by the US Consulate in Iraqs Erbil got much coverage.Closer to home it could focus on the lorry tailbacks at Dover, now visible to space satellites, or the new EU entry exit system with biometric tests at the border soon. How about the UK desire to change the Northern Ireland Protocol or the devastating impact Brexit has had on Scotlands GDP An ITV News bulletin certainly does not need the current padding.John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.WAR MAKES NET ZERO IMPOSSIBLENET zero  The Ukraine war changes everything. The EU is to classy gas and nuclear as clean energy. UK oil and gas drilling will be allowed on national security grounds. The Oil and Gas Authority is considering extending the use of two fracking sites in Lanarkshire.Germany is to restart its mothballed coal power stations. Europe is importing more coal.

London North Eastern Railway topped the list with .% of its pre-pandemic numbers, followed be East Midlands Railwayand TfL Rail .Over the period eleven franchised operators ran less than % of the train distances it was covering pre-pandemic. One was ScotRail, which managed .%, while TfL Rail, which was the best performer, managed nearly two-and-a-half times its original distance.And of  UK regions, Scotland saw the steepest train passenger journey decline in  , with just .% of that seen before the pandemic hit. The south west of England topped the list with .%.Once a famous city-centre landmark with its striking arched windows and domed roof, it was shut down in October  although the former station building remained unused for many years afterwards.The station was part of proposals for re-opening as part of Crossrail Glasgow plans published back in .When the Argyle Line opened in , the station was never reopened and was replaced by the new Argyle Street station.That would require the resurrection of the mothballed Crossrail Glasgow scheme – the long-proposed £m development that would link rail networks to the north and south of the city and connect Glasgow’s Central and Queen Street stations.That appears to have been superceded by for a new metro system, which aims to better connect the . million people living in the Glasgow region, and hasabeen included in the Scottish Government’s Strategic Transport Projects Review , which sets out transport investment priorities for the next two decades.Last month when transport minister Jenny Gilruth was questioned about the lack of information regarding costs and a timeline, she confirmed that the new metro could cost as much as £ billion and take  years to complete.The blueprint involves a new public transport system running from Paisley Gilmour Street train station, through Glasgow Airport and on to Renfrew, Braehead and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospitalbefore reaching the city centre.There is no timescale yet and no date for the first phase connecting Glasgow Airport to Paisley Gilmour Street.Jane Ann Liston, secretary of Railfuture Scotland said: \"These stations are considered necessary to provide an attractive and environmentally-friendly alternative to road vehicles. Each of the locations has some specic feature as to why it needs a station, such as an attraction which brings in many people, a major employer or simply a large number of residents who need to travel. These stations would open up more of the country to non-road travel\".The updated list comes years after its first blueprint. Since then seven recommended by the think tank have been or are being re-opened: Leven, Inverness Airport, Cameron Bridge, Robroyston, Kintore, East Linton and Reston.\"\"The original justications for the stations on the list still stand but to them must now be added the imperativeness of attracting people back to trains in the wake of the pandemic, as the message that public transport is not safe still lingers in the public consciousness with the result that passenger numbers are still well below what they were prior to March .\"Second on the priority list is a new Grangemouth station, with the pressure group estimating it would be used by , people a year.Next comes a station for West Lothian’s Winchburgh, needed because of plans for  new homes.A station at Edinburgh’s Abbeyhill would serve the Scottish Parliament and tourist destinations including Holyrood Palace.And it believes there is a case for stations at Culloden and Bannockburn, which would serve the historic battlefield sites plus residential areas of ,.New stations to the list include on the Alloa-Dunfermline line: Cairneyhill, Clackmannan, Kincardine, Valleyfield and  Culross.On the Edinburgh South Sub the Railfuture have added Morningside, Gorgie, Cameron Toll, Newington and The Jewel.Other new proposed new stations include:Belmont , Inveralmond, Abernethy , Kirkliston , Newburghand  Abington ."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-281-march-27-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter N and ends with the letter H.It has no vowels.It is a mythological creature, usually a young woman.What is today’s Wordle answer, Sunday, March  If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use.

Branches will remain vital in meeting customers’ needs but we must continually review our network to make sure we have branches in locations where customers need and use them the most.#As a result, we#ve made the dficult decision to close this branch because customers are using it less often. In addition the majority of customers are also using alternative ways to bank.#Explaining what the closure will mean for Bank of Scotland customers signed up to the Stromness branch, the bank adds: #You can use any of our branches and our nearest alternative is the Kirkwall branch.#You can also use a Post Office for your everyday banking.#We’re still here to support you, and there’s a number of ways you can bank with us. Read on to find out more, and for a summary of our review.#A second review of the branch is also due to take place, based on community feedback to the closure announcement.The bank states: #Following engagement with the local community, an overview of the feedback we receive will be given in our Closing Branch Review Part .#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A total of , people were interviewed between November  and December , using quotas to ensure those completing the survey were representative of the population. A Belfast City Councilbriefing paper for members of the authority’s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee reads: “On the whole, the results for  are positive. “In , satisfaction with council and le in Belfast dipped, a trend replicated across the rest of the UK.“This year, our results have improved on  and are now generally on a par, and in some places better than the  results. “For most of the council indicators we have reversed the downward trend in satisfaction and approval ratings, whereas this has continued in English council areas.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s

with Belfast and local area remains lower than in  , though still higher when compared to other local authorities.“Some data has fallen, such as views on whether all people can lead healthy lives or live le to the full, whether they feel listened to and whether they feel safe in the city centre at night. “This data will be used to inform improvement activities of council and the Belfast Agenda.”Looking at the results of the survey, % of respondents were satisfied with Belfast as a place to live, while % felt the city was a good place to visit, and % said Belfast residents are friendly, caring and compassionate.Some % of those surveyed said Belfast has good infrastructure, while % felt the city centre was vibrant, attractive and with lots going on.In terms of the more negative responses, % said they would not agree that Belfast is an environmentally-friendly city, and % disagreed with the statement that everyone in Belfast experiences good health and wellbeing.Worryingly, just over half of those surveyedsaid they felt safe in the city centre after dark.Back in October last year, Sinn Fein councillor Christina Black requested the council to begin work on a new strategy of city centre safety for women.“We all know the city centre has changed during, and emerging out of, lockdown, and with that perceptions of safety. “The experience of safety for women has to some degree altered, but it is very dficult to get an accurate benchmark,” she said during a meeting of BCC’s People and Communities Committee.”And she added: “Some incidents are not being picked up because of non-reporting, and that can be due to a lack of clarity about who to report an incident to, or whether it will be deemed serious enough, orit will actually be listened to.“But issues of street public harassment are happening, so what can we be doing to change attitudes and enhance city safety  “This request is not about criminalising or demonising, it is about exploring additional avenues for women to report issues that have concerned them.”Related topicsBelfast City CouncilSinn FéinMore On Belfast City Council PremiumJon TongeOpinionBurnham and Rotheram

Faulkner and other Cabinet ministers address a mass rally of Vanguard supporters from the balcony of StormontMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAt .pm, on March , , Northern Ireland’s House of Commons adjourned. It was never to meet again. Two days later the NI Temporary Provisions Act became law, introducing direct rule, ending  years of unionist government, bringing devolution to a stop and shutting down NI’s Parliament. It was the biggest crisis for unionism since the  Home Rule Bill.At lunchtime on March , Brian Faulkner, destined to be NI’s last Prime Minister, led his Cabinet onto the balcony to address the enormous crowdwhich had gathered in the grounds. He had only a loudspeaker.“People of Ulster, I am speaking to you still as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. I want to say, not just on my own behalf, but on behalf of every one of my colleagues in the Government and the Parliamentary Party here at Stormont, that we understand absolutely the feelings which have persuaded you to come out to Parliament Buildings today… we share the resentment that you feel. We have tremendous power.“Our power is the power of our numbers our power is the justice of our cause our power is the responsibility of our conduct. Let us never play the game of the murderers of the IRA. Let us show the world that, so far as we are concerned, violence and intimidation are out. British we are and British we remain!”The previous day Faulkner had addressed an emergency meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council, informing it that his government had lost confidence in Edward Heath’s administration.By his own admission it was an angry meeting seething at what was regarded as a betrayal and surrender to unionism’s enemies. But he also warned them to shun violent responses and rely, instead, on the ‘Unionist veto’ which lay in the strength of their numbers.Exactly  years later, on Monday March , the present Assembly will be dissolved in preparation for an election on May . There are many within the unionist community who believe that, like its predecessor on March , , this institution will not meet again.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Political unionism is again seething with anger, believing that another Conservative government has betrayed it and rolled over to the demands of those who want Northern Ireland removed from the United Kingdom. Indeed, they would argue that the process of removal has been advanced by a protocol which traps Northern Ireland in some sort of constitutional halfway house between Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union.When Brian Faulkner spoke of unionism relying on the strength of its numbers it was at a time when the combined pro-Union vote hovered around two-thirds of the overall vote.At the election for the first post-NI Parliament Assembly, in June , the pro-Union votewas %. In the  Assembly election that votehad reduced to .%.That election also saw unionism reduced to a minority within an NI Parliament and Assembly: and there is now a possibility, come May , that unionism won’t even have the numbers to qualy for the position of First Minister.And yet unionism remains as ided now as it was back in . The narrowing of the demographic gap between unionism and nationalism, along with an ongoing reluctance by successive British governments to be seen to be what might be described as pro-active on behalf of unionism, hasn’t pushed it in the direction of prioritising a coherent, collective, long-term strategy for survival.Even the thundering hammer-blows rained down on the DUP by Boris Johnson continue to be greeted with fairly mild responses from the party leadership.Speaking on Monday evening Jeffrey Donaldson acknowledged the problem: “It’s not a question of throwing the DUP under the bus. The Prime Minister threw Northern Ireland under the bus and the harm that this protocol has done to Northern Ireland is, I think, something the Prime Minister now recognises. But we need him to do something about it.”The problem, of course, is that Donaldson has been saying this since September last yearand Johnson has done nothing. He’ll continue to do nothing until May : and, in all likelihood, will do nothing after that, either.In March  Brian Faulkner and the UUP decided to risk the collapse of the NI Parliament rather than allow control of security to pass from the NI government to Westminster.A few days before Stormont was prorogued Faulkner had written to Edward Heath: ‘We wish to point out with a sense of the heavy responsibility involved that the imposition of this proposal, involving as it will the resignation of the Government of Northern Ireland as a whole, may have the gravest consequences, the full extent of which cannot now be foreseen.’We now know the primary consequence of the resignation and subsequent prorogation: the end of majority rule, the introduction of mandatory power-sharingand the sapping of unionist confidence that their future position within the United Kingdom was, to all intents and purposes, secure.What Faulkner did — although I fully understand why he had to do it — was hand over the political negotiating process to a British government which was determined to build an entirely dferent relationship with its Irish counterpart.In his biography, Memoirs of a Statesman , Faulkner hinted at regrets: “... when unionists of vision tried to stimulate new thinking and broaden the appeal of unionism in the s s I did not come out and support them. I did not think they were achieving anything useful...but we should have spent more time watering the roots of tolerance.“We did not take the initiative in reforming our society until events forced change on us. By  we were reacting to events rather than controlling them and one was always conscious of running very fast merely to make up lost ground.’Since then, a number of other unionist loyalist leaders have voiced fairly similar regrets. Sometimes about their own personal lack of foresight and sometimes about opportunities which unionism may have missed over the decades.Yet as Faulkner noted, there was always a sense that unionism was a few steps behind the thinking of others when it came to mapping out Northern Ireland’s post- future. Or, as former UUP leader Reg Empey put it, “every time unionism walks from the table it inevitably and iniably s to another table with a weaker hand”.In the early s a Minister of State based in the NIO told me: “The problem with unionism — and it’s a particular problem for those outside Northern Ireland who try to understand it — is that there are far too many ieties. They spend as much time complaining about their unionist rivals as they do complaining about their more specic political and constitutional opponents.”From until the collapse of Stormont in  the isions could mostly be controlled by the mantra — ‘United we stand. Divided we fall.’ But once the fall came there was nothing to hold unionism together and it splintered and continues to splinter.Faulkner and power-sharing were destroyed by the United Ulster Unionist Council in . Shortly afterwards the ious members of the UUUC — who couldn’t come up with an agreed alternative to the Sunningdale deal — turned on themselves.The UUP descended into civil war between -. The loyalist paramilitary groups, essential to the ‘selling’ of the Good Friday Agreement, have now withdrawn support for it. The DUP has had a horrible  months and is still beset with internal dficulties.A growing element of younger loyalism is pushing its anti-protocol campaigning towards prioritising the final collapse of the GFA institutions. And Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allisterhave laid down pre-election preconditions on both the protocol and the eventuality of a Sinn Fein First Minister.Change a few names and organisations and we could be talking about that period from March  to May  — when unionism and loyalism were struggling to find a route map from the crisis forced on them by widespread political societal instability and British governments which were determined to impose change upon them.But here’s the reality:the strategies and policies adopted by unionists didn’t work back then, why does anyone think terribly similar strategies and policies would work today: particularly when the constitutional crisis is worse now than then and the shadow of a border poll is hanging over every aspect of the coming election.A British state paper released in  had this assessment of the  Assembly election: ‘Mr Faulkner’s position is undoubtedly dficult. He will have less than half of the Protestant vote behind him, as Dr Paisley and others will no doubt vocerously remind him,and when he makes an effort to work the new system.“It was always to be anticipated that the Protestant vote would be fragmented… but the outcome has left the potential accepters weaker and the ‘wreckers’ stronger than expected.’Something very similar happened to David Trimble in , allowing his internal and external opponents to destroy him. Might the same thing be about to happen to Jeffrey Donaldson  Between  and  the DUP vote represented a majority of unionist votes cast — but even then, the party had to temper a lot of decisions and steer away from potential compromises and concessions. If the DUP doesn’t represent the majority of unionist votes cast and seats won in the Assembly on May  it will make it very dficult for Donaldson to reboot the executive.We seem to be on ‘the more things change, the more they stay the same’ territory for unionism. Again. But there is one dference. I was in that crowd in the grounds of Stormont on March , , a few months short of my th birthday.I recognised the scale of the shock: but I also recognised something , a new opportunity for unionism to do things dferently. My big fear today — and I’m very pessimistic, by the way, about a rebooted Assembly— is that unionism may have left it too late to do things dferently.Related topicsIRAAlliance PartyBoris JohnsonSir Jeffrey DonaldsonNorthern Ireland AssemblyUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinMore On IRA PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionQuashing of Soldier F decision is a rare good day for Bloody Sunday families and also signicant for historic prosecutionsUkrainian soldiers study IRA #Green Book# in preparation for guerrilla warfare against Russian forces PremiumNew IRA on its last legs, but dying wasp can still have a sting PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDowngrading of danger welcome news, but violence remains a real possibility PremiumAidan McAnespie: Trial of former soldier could be last Troubles criminal caseMost ReadDodgy east Belfast botox beautician must pay back £kFormer Northern Ireland Tory on upskirting and indecent child images chargesMark Sykes’ ‘no-brainer’ decision to play for Republic of Ireland as dad hits back at ‘bigot’ accusations with Belfast star in line to bridge  year gapWoman in Co Down hospitalised with serious injuries after horse fell on her and died‘Suits him’: Van Morrison applauded for weight loss winTop VideosPlayWalkthrough of Kincora boys# home in east Belfast PlaySpotlight: IRA Priest says Thatcher was right about himPlayKincora abuse victim tells of his torment at the home Latest PoliticsGail WalkerOpinionIf Stormont worked, the NI Protocol would be settled and we’d have the ‘best of both worlds’… this election will make no dference to real livesLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’Jon TongeOpinionBurnham and Rotheram united Manchester and Liverpool, so anything’s possible for BelfastViewpointOpinionNothing will be gained by scare tacticsMallon labels DUP ‘a party of irrational mood swings’LatestJust half of Belfast residents feel city is safe after dark, council survey findsLoyalist paramilitaries to target Irish government buildings as  weapons could be used in campaign against NI protocolAnti-protocol rallies raising tension and harnessing anger, says UUP leaderPO Ferries’ rivals set to meet with officials after mass sacking of staffDancing On Ice winner crowned,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close. Local health and social care trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.– Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR.– Routine asymptomatic testing will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings, including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings.– Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.– Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.– Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.– Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June.– Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable.“After these changes are introduced from April , I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them – for examplethey are eligible for new treatments.“In the coming weeks, the department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.“The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from Covid- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic.“Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new Covid- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe.“I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance, including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”Robin SwannNorthern IrelandPCR  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyJamie Bryson rejects idea of cutting funding to UVF-linked groups after Simon Coveney security alertUDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureNorthern Ireland weather forecast: Hope you made the most of the weekend sun - snow could be on the wayMost PopularBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, Conran best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and Birmingham                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyJamie Bryson rejects idea of cutting funding to UVF-linked groups after Simon Coveney security alertUDA probe: PSNI welcome sentences handed down to father and son after drugs seizureNorthern Ireland weather forecast: Hope you made the most of the weekend sun - snow could be on the wayMost PopularBest walking shoes for women UK : ladies’ hiking shoes from Merrell, Keen, Scarpa and OnBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, Conran best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and Birmingham                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This was an incredibly dficult decision that we wrestled with but once we knew it was the only way to save the business, we had to act.“All other routes led to the loss of , jobs and the closure of PO Ferries.“In making this hard choice we have guaranteed the future viability of PO Ferries and secured Britain’s trading capacity.“We are committed to ensuring the continued and ongoing support for all those former and current employees affected.” vw,vw,px, px\"Peter Hebblethwaite, chief executive of PO Ferries The company said the settlement with its workers is believed to be the largest compensation package in the British Marine Sector.A total of  employees are receiving more than £, and in some cases are over £,, said PO.The total value of the financial settlement is over £ million.Protests were held in Liverpool, Hull and Dover on Saturday and more are planned in the coming days.The Rail, Maritime and Transport and Nautilus International unions are urging the company to reverse the sackings and for the Government to take action against PO.A ship operated by the ferry firm was detained for being “unfit to sail” on Friday.The European Causeway vessel was held at the port of Larne in Northern Ireland due to “failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”, the Maritime and Coastguard Agencysaid.Mr Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that the firm broke the law by not consulting over the sackings.Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “The campaign to get the workers back on the ships, operating these crucial ferry links safely goes on and the company need to face up to the hard facts and take responsibility for their grotesque actions.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PO Ferries u rivals set to meet with officials after mass sacking of staff article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

In respect of the latter, I am committed to climate action, and promoting recycling is an important aspect in that regard. “This development could result in an increased market for waste disposal and to maintain a facility such as this, in addition to the other approved waste facilities, could discourage recycling. “I am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility.

Announcing the bounce back support scheme, Mr Poots said: “Many businesses and sectors were adversely affected by the Covid- pandemic, and our agricultural shows were not immune to these effects, with all shows cancelled in  and only a few being able to take place in . This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdaadedee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afcceeaec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?163516905100","title":"hargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband ","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work. The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdabcdafbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfcfcedbab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
