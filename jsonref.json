Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Kim Foxx woke Chicago DA tried help Jussie","story":"Share this articleRead State\u0027s Attorney Kim Foxx\u0027s texts and emails regarding the Jussie Smollett case - Chicago TribuneState’s Attorney Kim Foxx asked Chicago’s top cop to turn Jussie Smollett probe over to FBI, texts and emails show - Chicago Tribune"},{"url":null,"title":"Biden pledges voting rights legislation priority","story":"Share this article The legislation being voted on Thursday in the House tries to claw back some of what its supporters consider executive overreach that has been building in the U.S. for years and intensified during Trump\u0027s term. It includes provisions to strengthen enforcement of congressional subpoenas, protect whistleblowers and provide for congressional oversight of presidential emergency declarations, among other provisions, many of them previously backed by Republicans.Rep.

Simple, unsubtle, but effective. The price to pay.Generally the video system picks up every no-ball these days, so there is already an impost with the extra delivery and extra run. But it can sometimes - as we saw with Jasprit Bumrah during the English summer - be in a bowler’s interests to get a few extra deliveries at a player. So it’s not perfect. But few things are. “It’s been amazing the way the boys have gone about their business. Great to bowl first on the first morning and relentless yesterday. Dave Warner partnership with Marnus was incredible. Travis Head coming back from not playing for a while, what an innings that was.”And you’d scarcely credit it, but the skies are largely blue, the radar is clear, and the forecast is mostly sunny at a top of 31 degrees by the sensible scale of measurement. The score is Australia 343 for 7 in the second innings, after England’s 147 in the first.  But there is a way back into this match for England. The deficit is 196. The weather is set fair for the next two days. The way is: get these last three wickets quickly, then bat like a dream. Make about 400, get a couple of hundred ahead, and be in the game on the final day.  It may not seem likely at this stage, but I would guess this pitch will be its best to bat on today and tomorrow, with more time in the sun. Given Australia’s push towards 400, England could make one too. But of course, that depends on getting those three wickets. And we’ve seen the last few partnerships put on plenty before. One of the players resuming will be Travis Head on 112 not out from 95 balls, having made one of the fastest ever Test centuries by an Australian. He trusted his hands and eye last night, played a shot at each ball, and it worked for him. If he can push on today, he can shut the gate on even that narrow English avenue back into the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe5673b045389ce384153879d1ec6f47acd7888/0_207_5311_3187/master/5311.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ed201a9cd38a66ea262acd03393687da","title":"joe biden house summit democracy kamala harris us politics live","story":"The Empire star, who is Black and gay, sparked new controversy at the intersection of culture, racism, politics and celebrity when he said he was attacked. From our full report:  The DC Circuit Court of Appeals did pause its ruling for two weeks so that Trump could file an appeal with the Supreme Court. In a press conference on James’ decision to run for reelection and drop out of the democratic gubernatorial election, Hochul made the remark, seemingly confirming that James will be looking to hold the former president accountable.  A report from Reuters, which was first reported by the Washington Post, said that James, along with Manhattan’s district attorney, Cyrus Vance, are jointly investigating the Trump Organization’s business practices. “All I can say is I respect her tremendously... and I look forward to having her on the ticket as we head into the November election together,” said Hochul of the call between the two.  Releasing her statement on Twitter, Hochul said the following:  James announced earlier that she will be ending her gubernatorial campaign and instead seek reelection. Psaki also said that the president supports Ukraine’s “aspiration” to become a member of NATO, the intergovernmental military alliance. Psaki also cited different requirements that would face the country if they tried to join the alliance.  Psaki also said that aggression is on the side of Russia, referring to ongoing escalations between the two countries. Today, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is holding talks with Biden, according to an advisor from Zelenskiy’s office, Reuters reported earlier.The two men spoke as Russia continued a barrage of hostile rhetoric towards Ukraine and compared the crisis there to the most dangerous moment of the Cold War. Details of the talk are still emerging.But the attorney general has also played a pivotal role in going after opioid manufacturers and distributors in the battle to win some sliver of justice for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who’ve died of opioid overdoses in the last 25 years. Most prominently, she sued leading members of the billionaire Sackler family behind Purdue Pharma and its prescription painkiller OxyContin, in 2019, joining a growing list of state, county and city governments then alleging the drugmaker Purdue and its owners sparked the nation’s opioids crisis by putting profits over patient safety. A New York bankruptcy judge in September approved a settlement by Purdue Pharma, including about $4.5bn from the company’s billionaire Sackler family owners, even though the decision is still being challenged in court and provoked outrage from many critics and campaigners. But James has done her bit against this and other opioid players. As she tweets: After a quick surge in demand, children’s vaccinations in the US have tapered off sooner than expected. Five million children between the ages of five and 11 have received at least their first dose, but this is out of the 28 million children in this age group, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  After a short period of high demand, kids’ vaccinations began declining around Thanksgiving and continued downward. “This happened faster than expected - about 2 weeks in.” Jen Kates, coauthor of a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, said on Twitter. Parents are more likely to get their children vaccinated if their schools encourage them to, both because of the comfortable environment of school clinics and the trust families have in principals and other school leaders, Kates said. Some parents and caregivers have expressed reluctance over vaccinating their kids, with only one-third saying in September that they would do so as soon as the vaccine was authorized for the younger age group, five to 11. Some families may also face access barriers, an issue that is hard to determine at this point because of the limited data on race or ethnicity and other factors among vaccinated children.  “All this points to a long, tougher road ahead to getting Covid-19 vaccine rates up among kids, a concerning finding in advance of the holiday season, and as Omicron transmission increases,” Kates said.The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.“She has tremendous responsibilities as the sitting AG \u0026amp I understand her desire to devote her energies to seeing through \u0026amp continuing the important matters before her,” Suozzi, who currently represents a Long Island district in the House, said on Twitter. James’ decision to seek reelection as attorney general will likely solidify Governor Kathy Hochul’s frontrunner status in the race for the Democratic nomination. Hochul took over the governorship in August, after Andrew Cuomo resigned over sexual harassment allegations.James’ office conducted an investigation into the allegations and concluded the governor had engaged in a “pattern” of inappropriate behavior toward state government employees. “I’ve spent my career guided by a simple principle: stand up to the powerful on behalf of the vulnerable, to be a force for change,” James said as she announced her gubernatorial bid. “We can do this if we stand up and speak out together.”  James’ withdrawal from the gubernatorial race will likely come as a relief to sitting Governor Kathy Hochul, who took over the job following Cuomo’s resignation.“I have come to the conclusion that I must continue my work as attorney general,” James said on Twitter. “There are a number of important investigations and cases that are underway, and I intend to finish the job,” the Democratic official added. “I am running for re-election to complete the work New Yorkers elected me to do.” The news comes just hours after the Washington Post reported that James’ office is seeking a deposition of Donald Trump as part of its investigation into potential fraud at the former president’s company.Patel served as chief of staff to acting defense secretary Christopher Miller, after Donald Trump abruptly fired Miller’s predecessor, Mark Esper. The select committee subpoenaed Patel in late September, saying the official was heavily involved in discussions between the Pentagon and the White House as the insurrection unfolded on January 6.  “According to documents provided by the Defense Department and published accounts, Mr. Patel was involved with discussions among senior Pentagon officials prior to and on January 6th, 2021, regarding security at the Capitol, and told a reporter that he was talking to Mr. Meadows ‘nonstop that day,’” the committee said in its September statement announcing the subpoena. James has asked the former US president to come to her New York office to give testimony on 7 January 2022, the Washington Post reported moments ago, with the Reuters news agency noting the article. The DC publication points out that James’s request is: Reuters adds that: James, along with Manhattan’s district attorney, Cyrus Vance, are jointly investigating the Trump Organization’s business practices. The Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, were indicted earlier this year. Trump has not personally been accused of any crimes in relation to this investigation.Speaking in the Capitol Rotunda, Biden said, “Bob Dole loved this Capitol. It’s where he served this nation, shaped by the figures that surround us.” The president said it was fitting for Dole to lie in state in the Capitol, which he described as a “temple of liberty”. “In a sentence, Bob belongs here,” Biden said. “He, too, was a giant of our history.” The president closed by quoting Dole’s own words, repeating the longtime lawmaker’s message about the importance of prioritizing country over party. “I’ve always served my country best when I did it first and foremost as an American,” Dole once said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish people have strong appetite for scaled up climate action survey shows","story":" Irish people are in almost total agreement that climate change is happening, according to a new poll. File photograph: RSPBPA WireIrish people are in almost total agreement that climate change is happening, while 85 per cent are worried about it, according to a poll commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).In the most comprehensive survey of Irish attitudes to the emerging climate crisis ever conducted, the findings indicate the issue features prominently in public consciousness and suggests there is a strong appetite for scaled-up action by the Government in response to it. It is the first part of the Climate Change in the Irish Mind project undertaken by EPA with the Yale University Programme on Climate Change Communication in the US. It aims to develop better understanding of the Irish population by conducting a baseline study of public beliefs risk perceptions policy preferences and behaviours on the issue of the climate crisis – with a view to informing the upcoming National Dialogue on Climate Action.The poll, which was conducted by Behaviours \u0026amp Attitudes last summer, had a sample size of 4,000 adults. – Nearly all Irish people (96 per cent) think climate change is happening and is caused, at least in part, by human activities– More than 90 per cent of people say climate change is important to them personally 79 per cent say it should be either a “very high” or “high” priority for the Government – Irish people strongly support a range of policies to address climate change while 78 per cent also think climate action will increase jobs, economic growth and quality of life – Most people support spending carbon tax revenues on programmes to reduce carbon emissions and to prepare for climate impacts, and– Scientists (94 per cent) and the EPA (89 per cent) are the most trusted sources of information on climate change. EPA director general Laura Burke said the findings were definitive. “This is an important first step in a very valuable project that will help to understand how Irish people perceive the environmental challenge, and that can fundamentally change how we all communicate on the topic,” she added.The findings, she believed, “clearly demonstrate Irish people overwhelmingly recognise the threat, feel personally affected and want to see real change”. The results will be used to support climate change awareness and engagement campaigns, the design of national policy and climate action, she confirmed. Minister for the Climate Eamon Ryan said the cornerstone of the national dialogue was to engage and empower everyone in society to transition towards a climate-neutral economy “in a way that is fair, just, and accessible”. Dr Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale programme, said: “Irish people overwhelmingly accept the findings of climate science and strongly support a whole-of-society response.”"},{"url":null,"title":"north waterford district has highest rate of covid 19 in state","story":"The Portlaw-Kilmacthomas local authority area, which borders Co Tipperary, had a 14-day incidence rate of 2,400.7 cases per 100,000 up to last Monday.A district in north Waterford has the highest rate of Covid-19 in the country, according to the latest figures.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t.

File photograph: Tom HonanIrish citizens in Northern Ireland should have the right to vote in European elections, a new report recommends. The Seanad’s Special Committee on Brexit argues there is currently a “democratic deficit” where Northern Ireland is subject to the Single Market but has no representation at European Parliament level. “The committee is of the view that the Irish Government must make every effort to ensure the voice of citizens in Northern Ireland is properly represented at EU level,” it said in its final report on Brexit. It also recommends there be a dedicated body to act between the Northern Ireland Assembly and the European Parliament to discuss the impact of Brexit. Voting rights for Irish citizens is among 62 recommendations in the report relating to the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland. The committee suggests that the Irish Government and the EU begin preparations immediately for the vote in relation to the protocol, which is due to take place in the Northern Ireland Assembly at the end of 2024. It noted that the protocol has had a positive impact on many Northern Ireland businesses citing one printer stating that his increased by 16 per cent in the past couple of months as a result. The report believes the protocol has brought economic benefits to Northern Ireland and those should be articulated. But it also heard from DUP MLA Diane Dodds who said it had “isolated and marginalised unionism and many people from the unionist community”. The committee was told there is “not one unionist member of the assembly supports the protocol. We have not arrived out of the blue from another planet we are reflective of the society that we represent.” The report was completed before it became clear that the British government is considering legislation that would mean non-Irish EUEEA citizens will be required to apply for a US-style visa waiver known as an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) before entering the UK, including when crossing the land Border into Northern Ireland.The committee identified the rights of non-Irish citizens as potentially problematic, and said clarity should be provided around the implication of freedom of movement on the island particularly in relation to the free movement of non-Irish or non-British citizens, including asylum seekers who are resident in IrelandNorthern Ireland on a cross-border basis. “Furthermore, the committee recommends greater public engagement to raise awareness of the potential issues that may arise should the UK Government introduce an electronic travel authorisation system for the border.”Committee chair Senator Lisa Chambers said opposition to the protocol in some quarters is “genuine and must be addressed”.She added: “Having acknowledged these concerns, the committee believes ultimately that they can only be addressed through trust and cooperation between both sides and a willingness to agree solutions. “The committee hopes that current negotiations deliver a resolution in recognition of the importance of maintaining a good relationship between Ireland and the UK and the UK and the EU.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm barra i m at a loss to understand why schools in dublin were closed","story":"Marino College in Fairview, one of the schools closed in Dublin, due to Storm Barra. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Department of Education decided to close schools in several counties over the last two days due to the threat posed by Storm Barra.We asked readers for their views on whether the decision was justified and how it affected them.This is an edited selection of your responses.‘Another example of the contempt that this Government treats parents with’Claire Walsh DublinThe late-night decision by the Department of Education to close schools in Dublin today is just another example of the contempt that this Government treats parents with. Much like the last-minute mask decision fiasco the Government takes no consideration of parents ability to choose what might be best for their children or give parents time to deal with the fallout from the decisions. I would hope that in future they could consider parents in their late-night decision making.‘Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all?’Kieran O’Hare DublinA ham-fisted, behind-covering, one-size-fits-all decision that has greatly inconvenienced parents and deprived children of yet another day’s valuable learning. It was nothing more than a very windy day in south central Dublin on Tuesday. It was even less inclement on Wednesday. Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all? Why not delegate the decision to school principals. They are on the ground and best placed to make a call on local conditions. What will prompt the next enforced closure? The wrong type of wind?‘This is just not acceptable’Shirley Dunne GalwayIn Galway city, Tuesday was a bit breezy Wednesday was calm and the sun was shining. There is absolutely no reason why schools in Galway city should have closed. We will have a long winter, and negative implications on our children’s education, if schools close every time there is an orange weather alert. We are both trying to work from home whilst our children are home from school, and the school did not roll out any online learning or send home any materials for the children to work on. This is just not acceptable, or sustainable long-term.I am a third-year student in NUI Galway doing exams. They were planned to be on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday but due to the college closure the Tuesday and Wednesday exams were postponed to Saturday and Sunday. This creates a very stressful period as they have been placed in the middle of other exams. I now have four exams in a row from Friday to Monday, also with exams on the following Wednesday and Thursday. Six exams in seven days is not ideal. Both Tuesday and Wednesday did not display any strong winds that would prevent such exams taking place. This is not the type of pressure my course colleagues and I want in the run up to Christmas.‘I’ve no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports’S Riordan CorkI’m a separated mother of two small children working a four-day week. Working from home (WFH) has its benefits and generally I work a hybrid model mostly. However, when the preschools \u0026amp schools are closed and I’ve no back-up, I’m actually parenting from work at my kitchen table rather than working from home. And I have no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports – mainly my elderly parents – and the housing crisis, resulting in ever increasing rents, keeps pushing me further and further away from the city where my friends and family live. I do not live long enough in one place to make lasting friendships with neighbours that I could approach for help. My childminder is wonderful, but I pay her €70full day when I earn €95 net. I borrow to work the school summer holidays, I cannot afford any unplanned or unexpected curveballs like these last two days of red weather alerts and school closures. And with end-of-year deadlines, calling in sick is not an option. My workload would only be waiting for my return. Furthermore, I worry about the lasting developmental damage this frequent ‘WFH’ is forcing upon my young children. Both have been sick a lot lately and I cannot send them to school with even a snivel anymore. When they are sick I can no longer take time off to mind them because I am now able to ‘WFH’. So the frequency of this scenario of me at the kitchen table on the laptop ignoring them has increased.When there are two parents, they can help one another, give each other a break. I on the other hand, cannot even go to the shop for milk without packing us all out the door! Lets not forget that we’ve had long runs of school closures in the very recent past in this pandemic. And, in isolation these two days of red weather alerts and school closures would be manageable. However, within the context of this pandemic, a housing crisis and only the beginning of a long winter, it feels like the last straw.‘At 11pm we got the email the creche would close’Mrunal Kotkunde Dublin 16I was okay and scheduled all meetings to next day as I have toddler at home and it was difficult to work with him around. On Tuesday, weather was not bad in Dublin 16 and I thought the decision to close schools and crèches were uncalled for. They should have access the severity and took the decision only on affected areas and not generalised the decision. We got an email from the creche that on Wednesday it would be be open but at 11pm at night got the email that it was closed due to Government decision. Weather was not bad at all, as I have seen much worse weather than these two days. Has the crèche refunded us two days’ fees?We have already had enough stress due to Covid-19.‘Probably the right decision at the time’Kevin Connolly CorkIn our area of east Cork, the storm, thankfully, didn’t hit us as hard as other parts of the county or other counties. The decision to close the schools for the second day proved to be unnecessary in our part of the county, but it was probably the right decision at the time, and was no doubt influenced by poorer conditions in the west of the county. The decision was made in good time, 5.30pm and it was flagged for a few hours before the official decision was made.There was strong wind here for a couple of days. Nothing to worry about, yet two children home from school. Complete nonsense. Children packed into Mcdonald’s yesterday, and packed into indoor play centre today. It was NOT dangerous to go out. Stupid decision.I’m astounded at why the schools were closed when they have had ample opportunity over the past two years to operate online. It reinforces that those accountable for education in our country are not of a proactive or progressive mindset and take the easy option. Very disappointing.‘Conditions were not dangerous’Dermot Maguire DublinI am at a loss to understand why the schools in Dublin were closed. Conditions were not dangerous, it was indeed cold, wet and miserable, but it was also the same in December when I went to school 35 years ago. However, we just went to school and got on with it. Children have missed more school over the past two years due to the pandemic, on top of already the ridiculous amount of holidays for teachers, course days, etc. Of course, the decision to close schools was the one decision over the past number of years that the teacher unions accepted without question. I fear for the education of our children and their mental health.I had not been advised by the preschool so on Tuesday I turned up to it and realised it was closed. I had hectic days trying to do basic things as I live alone with a toddler. The school closures have disrupted my days but finally it’s over.‘These decisions should not be taken lightly’John Lalor DublinThe weather didn’t seem severe enough to justify the closure, in Dublin at least. Children have missed some much school time with Covid closures that these decisions should not be taken lightly. Additionally, most working parents had to take two days’ annual leave or lose two days’ pay to mind their kids at short notice. Obviously this isn’t the case in the Department of Education but decision-makers should be mindful of the impact on private sector workers.‘I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather’Anne Cassidy DublinI would not have sent my kids on Wednesday even if the Government had not closed schools. The weather warning finished at 7am. We leave the house at that time so I had already decided to do the safest thing for my children and work from home. I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather or the Government and I’m happy to blame the Government for a lot. I’m not sure sure I’d want to be a principal having to deal with that last night, but as a parent kids’ safety overrides my inconvenience. Even if in your particular area it seemed fine we all travel to work think how much more dangerous it would have been with school traffic and fallen branches.‘Is this to be the new norm?’Paul Richardson BrayIreland is an island. Consequently, the weather is regularly wet and windy. In Bray today it is merely breezy and a status yellow warning has been applied. But somehow the local environs are deemed unsafe for school commutes. If navigating your way past fallen leaves and the occasional puddle is challenging, then the decision to close schools for a second day was indeed a wise one. If on the other hand, you consider the inclement weather to be a regular feature of life in this country, then the school closures are perplexing to say the least. Is this to be the new norm – school closures on the basis of oft-cited, but rarely challenged, health and safety concerns?‘We don’t have a family to help in Ireland’Jonas Rall DublinIn Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, the storm was mild, with only leaves and bins being affected. My son, that is two years old, goes to a creche that closed Tuesday and Wednesday, with such short notice that I couldn’t make any arrangements. We don’t have a family to help in Ireland. This put massive stress over my partner and me to take the day off on Tuesday, move meetings and customers to the following days, only to be warned at 11pm on Tuesday that Wednesday would also have the creche closed. I found it unfair as I can see that the storm is not affecting my region, and I pay a hefty amount to the creche to help me take care of him so we can work. Moreover, it was clear in the note that the orange warning was only up to 7 am, with the first employees arriving close to 8.30am, they could definitely work on Wednesday.

Photograph: Jonathan PorterPress EyePA WireStormont officials are scenario-planning further Covid-19 restrictions that may be needed when, as expected, the Omicron variant becomes dominant in Northern Ireland early next year.First Minister Paul Givan said it was prudent for the Executive to prepare for the impact of the new coronavirus strain as he expressed concern at the rapid rate at which it is spreading in parts of Britain, where case numbers are doubling every two to three days.Executive Ministers were meeting on Thursday to discuss potential options, although Mr Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill expressed hope that no further restrictions would be required before Christmas.The deaths of a further four patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 were confirmed in Northern Ireland on Thursday. Another 1,819 cases of the virus were also notified.On Thursday morning, there were 338 Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom 38 were in intensive care.Stormont’s leaders were commenting as they visited Lagan Valley Hospital, where Mr Givan received his Covid-19 booster jab at Lisburn Primary and Community Care Centre.Northern Ireland’s booster programme has now opened up to people aged 40-49 who had their second dose of a vaccine less than six months ago.Mr Givan, who is in that new cohort, stressed the importance of ramping up booster rates to bolster the population’s immunity ahead of the inevitable spread of Omicron in the region.The DUP Minister said Northern Ireland was “behind the curve” when compared with the case numbers being recorded in England and Scotland and should be able to “get through the next number of weeks” before the new variant becomes dominant.“We don’t need to be panicking but we do need to recognise that what we are being advised is that this new variant is going to become a challenge for us in Northern Ireland early in the new year and we need to be ready for that,” he said.“So preparation is taking place. That’s what some of the discussion will be at the Executive today, so that we have all of this thought through in terms of what may be necessary.“That’s why I’ve said ‘don’t panic’ but we, as leaders of the Executive, need to make sure that proper preparedness is in place and we look at a range of scenarios, and obviously we hope that we don’t need to be doing anything whenever it comes to further restrictions that are being in place but it is prudent for us to be considering these things.”The Sinn Féin vice-president said it was likely Omicron would interrupt lives.“We want to avoid introducing restrictions, we want to keep people open and safe,” she said.“We want to take the pressure off the health service but, ultimately, I think it’s inevitable that at some point the Omicron variant is going to cause difficulties for our health service, but also economically because I think it is going to interrupt lives if it spreads in the way in which it potentially can, and the evidence shows from elsewhere that it will spread rapidly.“So that will have an impact in terms of services, I would imagine.“But we’re working to try to avoid introducing restrictions. We don’t want to be in that space. But we do think that by early in the new year this strain will be the dominant strain.”The leaders of the powersharing administration also stressed the need to address poor enforcement of Covid-19 rules in Northern Ireland.Public concerns have been expressed at the lack of action being taken to ensure compliance with rules such as mask-wearing. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics fresh restrictions breed frustration","story":"We assess the political fallout from the decisions taken over the past few weeks to introduce new Covid-19 restrictions covering international travel, masking children in primary school and the hospitality sector.

Photograph:  AP PhotoDenis FarrellCovid cases in South Africa have surged by 255 per cent in the past seven days but there is mounting anecdotal evidence that infections with the Omicron variant are provoking milder symptoms than in previous waves.According to a South African private healthcare provider, the recent rise in infections – which includes the Omicron and Delta variants – has been accompanied by a much smaller increase in admissions to intensive care beds, echoing an earlier report from the country’s National Institute for Communicable Disease.On Thursday, Marco Cavaleri, the head of biological threats to health and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency, said the situation in Europe remained “extremely worrying”, primarily due to the spread of the Delta variant, while preliminary data on Omicron suggested it may be more transmissible than Delta but cases appeared to be mostly mild.“However we need to gather more evidence to determine whether the spectrum of disease severity caused by Omicron is different to that of all the variants that have been circulating so far,” Mr Cavaleri said. “Only time will tell.” Precise pictureHe said it appeared that the currently approved Covid vaccines were considerably less effective in neutralising Omicron, but “we need to gather a more precise picture around the level of immunity that can be retained”.The World Health Organization said Africa currently accounted for 46 per cent of reported Omicron cases globally.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said that despite the global concern over Omicron, it was still unclear whether it was more transmissible or caused more severe disease, and he criticised western countries for imposing a travel ban on the country.South Africa’s biggest private healthcare provider, Netcare, said data from its facilities indicated less severe Covid symptoms in the current fourth wave than in previous waves.“Having personally seen many of our patients across our Gauteng hospitals, their symptoms are far milder than anything we experienced during the first three waves,” Netcare’s Richard Friedland told the Daily Maverick on Wednesday.“Approximately 90 per cent of Covid-19 patients currently in our hospitals require no form of oxygen therapy and are considered incidental cases. If this trend continues it would appear that, with a few exceptions of those requiring tertiary care, the fourth wave can be adequately treated at a primary care level.”Previous wavesMr Friedland said that in previous waves 26 per cent of Netcare’s Covid patients were treated in high care and intensive care units.Mr Friedland’s comments echo earlier analysis from Dr Fareed Abdullah, of the South African Medical Research Council, who said many of the patients diagnosed with Covid in hospitals in badly hit Gauteng province and elsewhere were often “incidental” identifications in patients presenting with other conditions.“The main observation that we have made over the last two weeks is that the majority of patients in the Covid wards have not been oxygen dependent. Sars-CoV-2 has been an incidental finding in patients that were admitted to the hospital for another medical, surgical or obstetric reason,” Dr Abdullah said.“A snapshot of 42 patients in the ward on December 2nd reveals that 29 (70 per cent) are not oxygen dependent. These patients are saturating well on room air and do not present with any respiratory symptoms. A significant early finding in this analysis is the much shorter average length of stay of 2.8 days for patients admitted to the Covid wards over the last two weeks, compared to an average length of stay of 8.5 days for the past 18 months.” Younger populationSouth African and other experts have said it is still too early in the Omicron outbreak to determine the longer-term course of the illness, and the younger population profile of South Africa means other countries may not necessarily see the same public health outcomes.South Africa has struggled at times with initially distinguishing between Covid variants, with some testing equipment unable to quickly spot Omicron without sequencing. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives are panicking but they are unlikely to abandon chaotic captain","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has apologised after ITV uncovered a video showing his staff laughing and joking about a gathering in Downing Street during a Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.

They never had much in the first place, which is why his chances of leading the party were seen as laughably low until the Brexit crisis. He was chosen as a wild card, the only man who could turn Theresa May’s mess into a majority. That hasn’t changed. So it doesn’t matter how frustrated they get with him: he is still, by some margin, the best election-winner they have. Until that changes, he stays.But a glorious revolution now seems to be underway. The king remains but his powers are being curtailed by parliament – or, in this case, his Cabinet. Sajid Javid yesterday ruled out compulsory vaccination, abruptly ending the “national conversation” that the Prime Minister called for the night before. No 10 can, of course, still press ahead – but having described mandatory jabs as “unethical” Javid would have to resign (again). In his way, the Health Secretary has drawn a red line around No 10.A few weeks ago, Rishi Sunak drew his own red line. Any extra revenue, he said, will be used to cut taxes rather than swell the state: that was his personal pledge delivered to a private meeting of backbench Tory MPs. No 10 might demand more spending but having made such a promise, Sunak would have to resign rather than break a personal pledge. So two holders of the four great offices of state have put the Prime Minister on notice. It’s quite an unusual situation.Both Sunak and Javid have already bent quite a bit, swallowing decisions that they would once have choked on. In the Chancellor’s case it’s the hugely-expensive Dilnot proposals for care homes. With Javid, it’s vaccine passports. Not long ago, the Health Secretary was assuring Tory backbenchers that this was an example of Hancock-era illiberal madness and that he’d bury the idea. He took great pride in telling Andrew Marr (and the public) that he was scrapping them. Now he is enforcing them, without any evidence, under orders from a panicked No 10.Politics is about compromise every leader disappoints. But what’s changing now is that the Cabinet is limiting Johnson’s power because, if left alone, there’s no telling what damage he’d do. Sunak was promoted because he accepted what Javid (his predecessor) would not: that No 10 would spend what it wanted to and the Treasury simply raised the money. Javid hated being called “Chino” (Chancellor In Name Only) and thought for a while that Sunak would be seen as a “babychino”. But since then, Johnson’s authority has rapidly and visibly drained.The rule-by-terror under Dominic Cummings has turned into a Boris Johnson court of chaos which is, if anything, worse. The Prime Minister’s bizarre decision to hold an inquiry into whether his own staff held a party under his own roof underlines the sense of no one being in charge. His ministers are told to rule out Plan B restrictions one day then, quite literally, implement them the next. It gives the impression of staggering decisions, affecting the lives of millions, being taken on a whim. As one minister puts it: “It’s a complete horror show.” It’s not just Twitter conspiracy theorists who suspect the new lockdown measures were intended to distract media attention from the growing scandal of rulebreaking Downing Street parties. There are members of the Cabinet who think that too. They can’t work out why else the vaccine passports arrived from nowhere, or why Johnson suddenly decided to emulate the European panic that he had been defining himself against. When he addressed the Cabinet this week, the Prime Minister admitted to this flaw in the logic – that, in effect, he had no evidence for his decision so no obvious exit strategy. But if this was a ersionary tactic, it has ended up a misjudgement of Owen Paterson-style proportions – turning backbench anger into cold fury. Small scandals that would once have been ignored are now seen to be far more relevant.So it matters, now, if there were several parties in No 10 rather than just one. It matters if such parties were (as one attendee tells me) “widespread” not just in Downing Street but across Whitehall. Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary, is now meant to be investigating – and in current political circumstances, this will not be a whitewash. This raises the question of what will happen to those who attended.And it matters, now, if the Prime Minister misled his ethics adviser by saying he had no idea how his wife’s new wallpaper was being paid for when, in fact, he had personally asked the man who held the purse strings for more. It indicates a shambles which has gone beyond embarrassing and is plunging the country into unpredictable lockdown regimes that seem more closely linked to the news agenda than hospitalisation rates.Johnson himself decided on strategic resignation. Thinking that Theresa May’s Brexit deal was heading for disaster, he thought he’d jump ship. As did Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Suella Braverman – all of whom ended up in good positions in a new regime. Ministers who think the Johnson project is doomed might be tempted to leave now, positioning themselves for what follows. The sheer turnover of staff in No 10 might be an earlier indicator of resignations to come.Ministers who do quit should be prepared to be on the back benches for quite some time. My hunch is that the Prime Minister will stay, but with more red lines drawn around him. Almost none of his Cabinet would tolerate compulsory vaccination, for example, but this time we should expect more to defy him by saying so in public. They are not (yet) ready to lose Johnson but will be actively asking who might do a better job.More from NewsBest actress award replaced with best \u0026#39female identifying role\u0026#39Boris Johnson’s standards adviser on brink of quitting over Downing Street flatA mild case of overreacting?

The Royal Navy’s frigates and vessels from the US and Netherlands navies departed in recent days.On Wednesday, the helicopters and F-35 jets of 820 Naval Air Squadron and 617 Squadron departed the aircraft carrier for the final time, returning to their respective units of RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall, and RAF Marham, Norfolk.The service personnel from nine ships, a submarine, five air squadrons and a company of Royal Marines will arrive home in time for Christmas.Families and friends gathered in Portsmouth to meet their loved ones.For 25 crew members it was the first time they had met their babies, who were born while they were away.Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said: “Today we pay tribute to the 3,700 personnel in the Carrier Strike Group that have been our global ambassadors on this historic and ground-breaking deployment.“The personnel and their families have made considerable sacrifices to make this deployment the success it has been. We thank them for all their efforts in strengthening our relationships with our allies and partners around the world.”Over the course of the deployment, the embarked aircraft of F-35 jets and helicopters clocked up 4,723 flying hours.The Air Wing consisted of British F-35 jets from 617 (The Dambusters) Squadron based at RAF Marham, Wildcat helicopters from RNAS Yeovilton and Merlin helicopters from RNAS Culdrose. There were also 10 US Marine Corps F-35 jets embarked on the carrier.Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Chief of the Defence Staff, said: “Throughout the past seven months, HMS Queen Elizabeth and her Strike Group have been furthering the UK’s interests and strengthening our partnerships around the globe.“With involvement from across the Armed Forces, and our allies integrated throughout, this deployment has been a truly joint, truly international endeavour, which represents the very best of Global Britain.”The Carrier Strike Group sailed across three oceans and five seas, cumulatively covering around 500,000 nautical miles.In June, a diplomatic row flared up between London and Moscow when HMS Defender transited within 12 miles of the Crimean shoreline.Russia, riled by the presence of Nato navies in the Black Sea, said it had been a “provocation” for the British warship to sail in what it sees as its territorial waters.Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 in a move that has not been recognised internationally.In September, China accused Britain of “evil intentions” after HMS Richmond sailed through the Taiwan Strait in what the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said was a “freedom of navigation” operation.The 110-mile wide strategic passageway between China and Taiwan is considered internationally to be high seas and is not subject to sovereign claims or jurisdiction.However, Beijing, which claims the island of 24 million as its own territory, regularly condemns United States warships for making “provocative” transits.Speaking at the time, Adm Radakin said the Taiwan Strait was clearly “part of the free and open Indo-Pacific,” adding that “it is a waterway that can be used by different nations”.One F-35 jet was lost in the Mediterranean Sea after a catastrophic fault developed on takeoff from HMS Queen Elizabeth. The pilot safely ejected.The wreckage was recovered this week, broken in “significant large parts,” the MoD said, after a multinational operation involving the US and Italian navies and commercial salvage vessels.More from NewsBest actress award replaced with best \u0026#39female identifying role\u0026#39Boris Johnson’s standards adviser on brink of quitting over Downing Street flatA mild case of overreacting?

The evidence is clear that the best place for children is in a classroom.But the UK\u0027s largest teacher union revealed that schools have already started to send whole year groups home to receive remote tuition because of a rise in teachers who are isolating.Some schools have closed down for a few days as a circuit breaker, while others have sent hundreds of children home until the start of the new term in January.On Wednesday evening, Boris Johnson said children should not be taken out of school before the end of term and nativity plays should go ahead.He told a Downing Street press conference: We don\u0027t want children to be taken out of school before the end of term, not that there is very long to go now.

Headteachers have been told to revisit outbreak plans and ensure contingency plans are up to date so they are prepared for any future changes.Ofsted inspections will not go ahead in the final week of term to ensure schools and colleges in England can plan for omicron contingency measures, the DfE said.Meanwhile, Oxford University told students there had been a significant rise in the omicron variant and has asked them to get a PCR test at a walk-in mobile testing unit in the city and take daily lateral flow tests while they await their result.Any students who plan to leave the city should take two lateral flow tests three days apart and report their results to the university.More from NewsBest actress award replaced with best \u0026#39female identifying role\u0026#39Boris Johnson’s standards adviser on brink of quitting over Downing Street flatA mild case of overreacting?

It has led to some key questions over what we can and cant doPeople will be hoping they can spend Christmas parties with friends and loved ones Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | comments People have been venting their anger over the latest scandal to rock Downing Street - a Christmas party alleged to have taken place in number  when the UK was in lockdown last December. A boozy party is alleged to have been at the governmentaposs HQ on December , . Around  people are reported to have attended.It caused fury from members of the public and uproar in the House of Commons, as some people who abided by restrictions were not able to visit dying relatives in hospital. Amid the storm, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has introduced new restrictions to try and slow the spread of the latest strain of Covid-, the Omicron iant. The restrictions are known as aposPlan Bapos and people are also being encouraged to get their booster jab. The scandal, along with the timing of the new announcement, has led to further worries about restrictions over Christmas andtraditional festive celebrations can go ahead So what can we do under Plan B Can I have a Christmas party   Currently, under Plan B rules, people are now being advised to work from home from Monday, December . Despite this, it appears work Christmas parties can go ahead. But keep in mind that Covid passes, known commonly as aposvaccine passportsapos will be required in nightclubs from December , as well as a host of other venues. These are not required for any events taking place at home, so for now it does appear you can have a Christmas party with your loved ones.  In response toChristmas parties should be cancelled, the PM said: No, in my view they should not. They should follow the guidance, of course, but we are not saying we want kids to be taken out of school before the end of term – not that there is very long to go now – and we don’t want nativity plays to be cancelled. We think that it is okay currently, on what we can see, to keep going with Christmas parties. What you can and canapost do under Covid Plan BMandatory mask-wearing was extended to a range of other outlets, a full list of which can be seen here, but includes public transport, nail salons, post offices and places of worship.Working from home is the other big development, while vaccine passports are required under the following conditions:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions.

Christmas party rules in the UK following plan B announcementIf you want to go to a nightclub, you will need to get yourself an NHS Covid Pass. These are valid from  days on your NHS app and refresh every time you log in and you need to be fully vaccinated.If you are not fully vaccinated for medical reasons, you can still apply for a pass. The government explained: You can apply for proof of evidence that you have a medical reason why you should not be vaccinated or tested.  If you are eligible for proof of medical exemption, or a carer obtains this on your behalf, you will be able to use the domestic NHS Covid Pass wherever you need to prove your Covid status. You can also get printed passesyou do not have an online presence. At present, pubs and other hospitality places do not require people to wear masks, though this may change in the future, and may be a good place for a small get together.

Experts warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.People are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in more settings from Friday, produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday, and may get daily contact testing instead of isolation.It’s what the PM hoped not to do. He hoped he would not have to review restrictions until next week in time for their expiry on December .Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,.  England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty added: “We know that it looked asit was going to evade vaccination. And now, clinically, we know that it can.” Yet Mr Javid was booed in the Commons as he introduced the work-from-home order - which has left Tory MPs furious. Tory MP William Wragg said vaccine passports “will create a segregated society” - and accused the PM of a dead cat to distract from the No party. “Very few will be convinced by this ersionary tactic”, he swiped. So what can and can’t you do  Here’s the full rundown of new rules. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues Under Plan B, certain venues will be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass. Under previous plans only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test.But today Boris Johnson announced he is putting this plan into action from am on Wednesday  December - with a key change.Contrary to previous plans, he said “a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient” to get you into a nightclub evenyou aren’t double-jabbed.  People who haven’t had the boosterwill still be eligible for now - but Mr Johnson said “we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out.” It’s thought venues affected will be all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia. Working from home Under plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”, according to the September document. Today Boris Johnson announced that policy. He said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “From Monday you should work from homeyou can. Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” The winter plan admitted: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions.” But SAGE had warned it would be a key way of getting cases down. Mandatory face masks  Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since am on November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Tonight Boris Johnson announced they will be extended to “most public indoor venues including theatres and cinemas” too from .am this Friday. There will be exemptions for eating, drinking, exercising, and singing. For that reason, hospitality venues - including pubs and restaurants - will be completely exempt. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. Daily contact testing New rules say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days. But that could cause a pingdemiccases surge to a million in total by the end of the month, as Sajid Javid warned they could. Therefore Boris Johnson said the government will introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation. He did not say when. Face masks in schools At the end of November, secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement. New foreign travel rules Since November , all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world have had to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Since yesterdaythey have also had to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight back to the UK. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Eleven countries were also added to England’s red list, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. They include South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Boris Johnson did not announce any extension to this tonight. ‘Clear communications’ This is where Plan B gets vaguer. The Winter Plan said the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” Boris Johnson today gave some of that messaging as ministers warned of the rapid doubling time of the virus. When will Plan B end  The measures announced today will be reviewed on January  and the government will update Parliament. Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant. Don’t forget the original lockdown was only for three weeks. We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place. Key questions the government would ask include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions.The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital.Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme.The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further  Yes. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out lockdown measures at Christmas - or, as some scientists fear is more likely, in January when Omicron surges. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document in September said: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSPlan BBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsPublic transportShopping centresSecondary schoolThe economyPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is clearly an alien concept to Boris Johnson who every day he is in power brings more disgrace on this highest of offices. His sense of entitlement is such he spent a reported £, on refurbishing the No flat and expected someone  to foot the bill. This extravagant expenditure came on top of the taxpayer-funded £, grant he gets each year towards its upkeep. It would never have crossed his mind how insulting it would look to spend £ on a single roll of wallpaper while cutting £ in welfare support from the poorest households.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  The Prime Minister is also accused of misleading his own ethics adviser about who paid.

The Prime Minister has tried to fend off a storm of criticism over an apparent secret festive bash on December  last year. The Met Police has ruled out an official investigation into alleged breaches of Covid rules, but the PM has asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to establish the facts. Leaked footage of staff, including the PMaposs former spokeswoman Allegra Stratton, joking about cheese and wine at the bash and definitely no social distancing, however, sparked fresh public anger about the get-together. Ms Stratton resigned on Wednesday after the video emerged.

Everyone should continue to behave cautiously and we recommend people take lateral flow tests before meeting others socially in high-risk settings, but it is up to inidual businesses and people to decide what works for them. No is focused on tackling the rise of the new omicron iant and the ongoing pandemic, and there are therefore no plans for a party while this intensive work is ongoing.At a press conference held on Wednesday Boris Johnson confirmed that the nation would move into Plan B in a bid to curb the spread of Covid. People are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in more settings from Friday, produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday, and may get daily contact testing instead of isolation.Meanwhile, more than  cases of Omicron have now been confirmed across the UK, with  new cases reported in a  hour rise. Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister said the doubling time of the new strain could be between two and three days - meaning its spread will be rapid. “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home, he said. “Employers should use the rest of the week to discuss working arrangements with their employees but from Monday you should work from homeyou can. “Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.

In the following year, all three received an indefinite leave to remain, and a year after this, they received their British Citizenship. With this, I also automatically gained citizenship through my parents - and of course, I was born here - so for all intents and purposes, I was and am British. Growing up in North London, I went to school in Barnet and then went on to secondary school nearby as well. Ultimately, I graduated from University of London while working multiple jobs throughout my university years. I then started my career as a journalist and hoped to make a change because the industry lacked British south Asians, and coverage around the community has been predominantly negative. There are around six million people like me, with similar stories of being born and brought up here, working in the UK and classing themselves as British Pakistani - which, despite having Pakistani at the end of it, does not make the aposBritishapos part of it any less credible - surely  Although at times it feels as though we are unwanted, this country is where we entered the world and is what we know. Evenwe decide to visit our home countries to gain more of a connection with our cultures, at the end of the day we are British citizens, right  But as much as we try to cling on to being British Pakistani or British Bangladeshi, British anything, the second part of the title has become a tool to ensure we know that we are in fact second-class citizens. This is because even though I was born here, I can be deprived of my citizenshipI am able to become a national of another country - for me, I could be deported to Pakistan on the governmentaposs whim. Despite being born and brought up here, clause , proposed by Priti Patel in July and updated last month, would allow for the Home Office to deprive me of my citizenship without delivering physical notication.This means,I went abroad and the government was unable to contact me, before boarding a plane back I could be told my passport is no longer valid without any warning.Mohammed Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer known for representing Shamima Begum, explained how the new clause impacts Brits like me. He said: The existing law is thatthe Home Secretary deems you not conducive to the public good, and wish to strip you of citizenship, they have to sent you a notice of their decision with a reason for why they are stripping you of citizenship. However, now with the new clause, they donapost have to tell you, youaposll only be told when you try board a plane and your passport is no longer al. The government has said those who are deprived of their citizenship without notice have the right to appeal, but Mr Akunjee says there are issues with this.  He said: You need a physical notice in order to appeal a decision -you donapost have that then the courts will demand that you prove that you have actually have been stripped. You have to acquire that proof and be able to submit that to the court before you can even appeal. Additionally, although some might think that being born here would put you less at risk of being deprived of your status, Mr Akunjee says from a legal perspective, it does not. He said: Both peoplecan be stripped of their citizenship, being born or not born here doesnapost make a dference in respect of this bill. According to , the Home Office has said: “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm. The Nationality and Borders Bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice, for example,there is no way of communicating with the person.” So this means that as long as I am a good immigrant, I can stay in the UK  ButI was white, as I would be less likely to be able to get another nationality I would be more likely to keep my British citizenship regardless of what threat I pose to the public. *A version of this piece originally appeared on MyLondon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelHome OfficePoliticsShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The further damaging details emerged as Labour urged police to open an investigation into allegations No  staff broke coronavirus rules with a Christmas party in Downing Street last year, saying it was “implausible” for Scotland Yard to suggest there is insufficient evidence.Itaposs understood the event was held by Mr Baileyaposs campaign team, who were working in the basement at the time. A Tory spokesman said: “Senior CCHQstaff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of Matthew Parker Street organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of December . “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign”. As the Prime Minister announced Plan B restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron, he confirmed a Whitehall probe would be held into a party held on December , and any evidence of rule-breaking would be available to any police investigation. The Whitehall probe will focus on the bash at which officials had drinks, nibbles and party games, including a Secret Santa, late into the night. The PM on Wednesday finally apologised unreservedly over a No Christmas party - but denied all responsibility, continued to claim he was told rules were followed, and threw his own staff under the bus. Mr Johnson said he was sickened and furious at a clip of his own staff laughing about a Christmas bash four days after it happened last December, when lockdown rules banned social gatherings. Mr Johnson faced calls to extend the investigation to include a leaving do on November , . It is claimed Mr Johnson gave a speech and his former senior aide Lord Lister was thereAnd he was also asked about claims, which he denied, from Dominic Cummings that there was a smaller gathering in the Downing Street flat Mr Johnson shares with we Carrie.Sources told the Mirror that senior No  aides “were all drinking their socks off” at the alleged gathering on November  last year. Downing Street staff reported hearing “loud music pumping out of the flat” late into the night after Mr Cummings, the PM’s former top aide, had walked out of No . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson dismissed the claims as “total nonsense”. The Department for Education’s top official announced that Gavin Williamson’s staff party in the run-up to last Christmas will also be investigated by the Cabinet Secretary. No also faces questions over a report by the BBC into a Christmas quiz that took place in person at the Cabinet Office with No staff joining in.Mr Johnson said he had asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to look at allegations relating to December , rather than at any other dates. Any aides found guilty of breaking the rules would face disciplinary action. One of the PM’s most senior aides Allegra Stratton tearfully quit after leaked footage showed her laughing and joking about a Christmas party and Covid rules while the rest of the country faced restrictions. Mr Johnson claimed he was “furious” about the leaked footage of Ms Stratton. The politan Police acknowledged it had received “a signicant amount of correspondence” relating to the alleged breaches in No  in the run up to Christmas last year but said they do not “provide evidence of a breach” of Covid rules. “Based on the absence of evidence and in line with our policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of such regulations, the Met will not commence an investigation at this time,” it added. But the force did leave open the possibility of further inquiries by saying it would consider “any evidence” that emerges in the Case inquiry. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said the Met should be “knocking on doors, taking statements and investigating people in No  in the way they would my constituents or anyone  in the country”. “It seems implausible for the politan Police to argue there is no evidence that parties took place,” he told reporters. “They’ve got to pursue this investigation without fear or favour and treat the Prime Minister and his staff as they would treat anyone .

Public Health Scotland issued new Covid advice today asking people to postpone their festive bash this year and do their bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones. At Wednesdayaposs Covid- briefing, Mr Johnson said Christmas parties could go ahead but that people should exercise caution. He said: Itaposs OK to keep going with Christmas parties but obviously everybody should exercise due caution, have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go - give everybody  confidence they are going to be meeting somebody who is not contagious.” Downing Street will not be hosting any Christmas parties themselves this year, despite the PMaposs OK to go ahead. No officials will be focusing on the intensive work needed to tackle Omicron. There are also fears growing over the rapid spread of the much more transmissible Omicron iant.  It comes as the UK recorded a , new infections and the latest UK Health and Security Agency confirms  cases of Omicron north of the border. Dr Nick Phin, Director of Public Health Science and Medical Director, said a signicant number of Covid outbreaks in Scotland have been linked to parties. He said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new Covid iant is much more transmissible. The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties. “We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of Covid-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time. “I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Throughout the pandemic, a tightening of restrictions in Scotland has frequently been followed by similar measures in England. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is under increasing pressure after it was revealed Downing Street had a secret Christmas party last December, at the height of the second wave. He was forced to apologise after footage emerged of senior staff laughing and joking about cheese and wine and definitely no social distancing at the get-together. No has confirmed they will not be hosting a party this year. A Downing Street spokesperson said: As the Prime Minister said Christmas parties can continue to go ahead under Plan B. Everyone should continue to behave cautiously and we recommend people take lateral flow tests before meeting others socially in high-risk settings, but it is up to inidual businesses and people to decide what works for them. No is focused on tackling the rise of the new omicron iant and the ongoing pandemic, and there are therefore no plans for a party while this intensive work is ongoing. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had asked Scots to comply strictly with current protections, adding in tweets on Wednesday: And evenyou feel angry with a politician just now, please remember just how important compliance is for the health and safety of you, your loved ones and the country. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons this week that there was now community transmission of Omicron in all regions of England.On Wednesday, the Prime Minister announced the country would move to the governmentaposs Plan B plan for Covid curbs, with home-working advised from next week. It also includes more mandated face masks in places such as theatres and cinemas and a Covid pass system for large public events. Tory MPs will vote on the plans next week, with backbenchers set to rebel.

Under Plan B, which was enacted by the Prime Minister on Wednesday, face coverings will become compulsory in most public indoor venues from Friday, including cinemas, theatres and places of worship, but not gyms, bars or restaurants. Masks are already required on public transport and in shops. Boris Johnson on Wednesday that there was an exemption for singing.However, anti-maskers who wish to get around the rules by singing their way round the aisles could still face fines or prosecution - despite the apparent loophole. That is because the singing exemption will be classed under “reasonable excuses”. Thereforepeople are singing without a reasonable excuse - such as in Tesco as a protest - they could be seen to be pushing the boundaries of the law. This was mainly seen as being applicable to places of worship where a mask should be worn during the service but could be removed to sing carols or hymns. But officials confirmed on Thursday this would also be applicable to other indoor settings. Asked whether a shopper could therefore remove their mask in Tescothey were singing, it was confirmed that would be within the rules as would removing the mask to sing in a theatre. But the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “I would urge, as the public has been throughout, to be responsible and sensible, and that is what we have seen.”  He said: “It’s about striking the right balance. We recognise that whenever you’re deciding which measures or restrictions to introduce, you do need to draw appropriate balance.” He added that it was “practical and sensible” to put the measures in place. The exemption is another example of how the new measures appear to have some idiosyncrasies. Masks do not need to be worn in hospitality settings, eventhe person is not eating or drinking. And under Plan B people are being told to work from homethey can from next week, but Mr Johnson said it was still possible for Christmas parties to go ahead. And the guidance would not stop colleagues gathering at a pub to do their jobs. Officials confirmed there was nothing within the rules to stop colleagues meeting at a pub to work, with the focus being on reducing the transmission risk from the commute and within the workplace. It would be up to employers and employees to decide how to interpret the new guidance. But the advice is thata worker does not need to go into the office, they should work from home, in order to slow the spread of the Omicron iant. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Obviously, we have, sadly, been in this position before and employers and employee, by and large, have demonstrated that they’re able to work together and come up with an agreement recognising both business need and also the needs of iniduals and personal le circumstances.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoPlan BBoris JohnsonPublic transportPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Paul Oxborrow, , from Norwich runs Thorpe Plant Centre with son Elliott, . In , he came up with the novel idea of pushing human beings into netting used for festive firs - and itaposs since become a tradition. As word spread of his funny idea, Paul set up a special grotto, complete with fairy lights, that customers can visit in order to be aposnettedapos - using biodegradable mesh, of course. Anyone who wants to become a human Christmas tree simply has to make a donation to Paulaposs chosen charity - and it attracts all sorts of people. Paul said: We had a gentleman go through the netting machine who was probably in his mid-s. He didnapost stop laughing from start to finish. Weaposve had kids as young as  months. Some kids go home like Christmas trees, they hop to their parentsapos car.  Weaposve had parents come back saying, aposWhen you netted our son last weekend, he stayed like that all Saturday afternoon in the living room.apos So far this year, Paul has raised £ by netting human beings - with the proceeds going towards food parcels for Thorpe Helping Hands, a local community group. Paul said: This year weaposre asking people to make their donations, then we use the money to put together boxes of non-perishable food. Helping Hands have agreed to take these parcels off our hands and distribute them just before Christmas to families and iniduals who need support. So, hopefully, itaposs spreading a little goodwill and joy to vulnerable people. Itaposs not a massive thing, but weaposre in a world whereeveryone did a little bit it would be much better.The salesman reckons heaposs had people travel  miles for the experience of becoming a human Christmas tree as word of his tradition has spread.Three years ago, when we first started doing this, but it wasnapost that well-publicised, one family of four turned up in Christmas jumpers and they all went through the netting machine, said Paul.Then the lady proceeded to take out Christmas tree ornaments, baubles and tinsel and decorate everyone, before taking some photos.He first got the idea to turn humans into Christmas trees when his son and daughter, Kayleigh, played games of jumping into the netting as kids. However, although heaposs won a lot of fans with his human netting machine, Paulaposs not tempted to try it out himself.Iaposm sure my family would find it hilarious, he said. But Iaposm a bit on the large size - or at least thataposs my excuse!I could probably squeeze through, but Iaposve never particularly felt the urge to do it.Paul and Kayleigh are first-aid trained in case anything ever goes wrong with the human netting process - although theyaposve not had any disasters so far. When someone goes through the machine, they have to line up with the cylinder before working their way inside. Then Paul grabs their wrists and pulls them through. He said: For that moment they really are a human Christmas tree!

Dickie Borthwick, , played his first match as a young boy and has continued for over seven decades. But in recent years he has been sidelined by the pandemic, back pain and a chest infection. The Sunday league footballer is now planning his own testimonial. The grandfather-of-seven said: “I’ve just had my th birthday. With the time away from playing, then the chest infection I think it is time to pack it in. “I’ve had a good run. “I’ve still got the urge to get out there and kick the ball around butyou can’t do it, then you can’t do it. “I’d love to play one final match when the weather gets warmer.“I’ll be getting two teams, all over s, together to play at Portland United’s football ground - that’s where I played most of my veteran’s matches.” Dickie, who beat prostate cancer nearly  years ago, has played over , matches and scored around  goals. The retired engineer last turned out for local veterans team AFC Wyke Smugglers in December  at the age of .  But a combination of sciatica and the Covid- lockdowns put him out for over a year. Dickie, of Weymouth, Dorset, says more recent health problems forced him to consider his future in the game. He explained: “I’ve had a really nasty chest infection but I managed to pull through. “Before that I had sciatica and before that I couldn’t play because of the pandemic. “Because I’ve had such a long break away from the game, I think it would probably be too much of a struggle to play again, especially in cold weather.”  Dickie was born in  and began playing football aged seven. He has seen  England managers come and go and says he has no interest in playing gentler forms of the game. He said: “I wouldn’t play walking football. “I’m used to playing the whole  minutes at full pelt. “I still want to play the game properly.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Back painProstate cancerSunday League football\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But Calderdale Council, the authority responsible for lighting the festive fir, has defended the tree’s decorations, or lack of, by explaining that the natural tree had grown “signicantly larger”. It therefore was no longer safe to reach its highest sections, the council reasoned.But Conservative councillor George Robinson described it as a aposshamblesapos and locals fumed that after close to two years of Covid regulations, theyaposd hoped for some festive joy.Mr Robinson said: Weaposve had a torrid year with Covid and lockdowns, we just want a Christmas tree to enjoy.  Itaposs a shambles, the worst Christmas tree in the North.According to Yorkshire Live reports, ex-Halax rugby league ace Jamie Bloem fumed: After the two years everyone has gone through, a Christmas tree to bring a bit of cheer is a necessity.It would be a bit of colour in an otherwise dull time. And now with tighter restrictions, I think a bit of cheer would be great right now. Margaret Bates said: Iaposve just driven past this. I thought there must be a fault in the lights. Please tell me itaposs not meant to be like this - it looks ridiculous. Dave Cocker quipped: Who was decorating it, Warwick Davis and Mini Me  One wag online quipped: Bailf Bridgeaposs pledge to reduce their carbon footprint has been put in to force.  While another said it was the aposmost depressing Christmas tree decorations in the UKapos. However, Matt Bell was quick to defend the council, saying: People be laughing at health and safety restrictions are the same ones suing the council over sh*t that happens to them. The Labour-controlled council said it provided trees and decorations to bring some festive cheer to towns and villages. The tree remains in place all year round and was decorated as in previous years, it said. But council added the tree had grown signicantly larger and due to safety and accessibility the decorations were spread amongst the lower branches. Cllr Jenny Lynn, cabinet member for public services and communities, said: “We provide Christmas trees and decorations across Calderdale to bring some festive cheer to our towns and villages, and we wish all our residents a very happy Christmas. “The tree in Bailf Bridge is a naturally growing one, which remains in place all year round and is now several years old. We have decorated the tree this year, like we have in previous years. As the tree has grown signicantly larger over time, and due to its location, it is no longer safe or accessible to decorate the highest sections of the tree, as they can’t be reached by any maintenance vehicles. Therefore, this year we are only able to decorate the lower branches. “Next year we will ask local community groups to nominate another, more easily accessible tree, for a much fuller decoration.”  The tree isn’t the first to be criticised this festive season the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree has been branded a aposflea-bitten embarrassmentapos, with criticism prompting Norway officials, who gted the tree, to consider providing a replacement.The treeaposs official account, run by Westminster City Council, said: “I would like everyone to know that half of my branches are not missing...

Jen passed away a few days later following a battle with cancer. Early last year, Jen, , celebrated five years of being cancer-free after undergoing treatment for breast cancer.

Jen had two children with her ex-husband and after meeting Ben and then went on to have three more children.  Ben said: The community has also very kindly donated to a Just Giving page for the wedding costs and they have kept things open for a fund to help me and the kids stay afloat. I had no idea how I would get five kids through Christmas and three birthdays when my salary will barely cover the bills on my own, the donations will help me make sure that their first birthday Christmas without mum is as happy as can be. My one daughter even insisted on wearing her wedding dress to school for children in need of a non-unorm day.  Her last moments were with me holding her hand. I told her that I loved her and the kids loved her. The movie that had been playing in the background had just finished and I sad to the nurse aposI canapost believe the last film sheaposll ever watch is Big Mommaaposs Houseapos, a stupid joke to break the tension and the nurse and I laughed. Then I noticed that her chest wasnapost moving and asked the nurse to check and sheaposd gone.  So either the last thing she heard was aposThe kids love youapos or another stupid comment from me. I think Jen would have been happy with either. I stayed with her for a while, holding her hand and talking to her while my friend came to pick me up. Then I gave her one last kiss and said aposGood night Beachapos , and I went home to the kids. Ben shared a photo of the couple after their nuptials on Twitter just two days before Jen died, writing: I finally married the love of my le on Wednesday. Not the day we had planned but amazing.Iaposm heartbroken that this marriage will be counted in days not years. Donapost put things off, tell the people you love that you love them now. The post has now collected over , likes, , retweets and , likes from users who shared their congratulations.

The former director of the Runnymede Trust has warned that children are the biggest unprotected group and should be better shielded ahead of Christmas. The introduction of so-called Plan B is staggered, with face mask rules kicking in tomorrow, a working from home order on Monday and vaccine passport requirements from Wednesday. Dr Haque said rules around face masks made little sense and should be required in more indoor spaces. Indi Sage have been asking the Government this for several weeks now, she told Sky News of the Plan B rules.  Weaposve reached over ,a couple of times since the start of school term. It is not too soon, itaposs a good time to introduce it, but it doesnapost go far enough. Dr Haque continued: What we need to understand is we are facing an extremely transmissible iant. The Omicron iant is doubling every two and a half days. The biggest unprotected group right now are children, and yet theyaposre not vaccinated, there are no mitigations in school, the Government have not come up with a single measure to protect children in school. We would be asking for face masks in classrooms, the Government to improve ventilation over Christmas, the reintroduction of bubbles, and fewer parties in schools. The Government is talking about face masks, in some places like theatres but not in restaurants. It doesnapost work. The virus doesnapost know when to stop and when to carry on. We need comprehensive, good information about face masks from the Government and comprehensive coverage.  Dr Haque praised the Government for re-introducing the work for home mandate as of Monday, but said it sent a mixed message. At the same time they have said go ahead and carry on partying, she continued. That is an extremely confusing and dangerous message to send to the public. The scientist went on to criticise Downing Street for not requiring people to self-isolatethey test positive. She urged Brits to keep themselves as safe as possible by wearing high-quality face masks, limiting socialising and having smaller gatherings.Dr Haque is not the only expert to find fault with the Governmentaposs latest coronavirus plan. Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of Noaposs own Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, has warned that we aposneed much more severe restrictions to turn it aroundapos. He told Sky News the virus is moving very fast so itaposs important that we react to that fast. He added: Itaposs a bit likeyou think of a monthaposs worth of rain falling in a few days, that leads to flooding and itaposs a similar type of scenario... we can reduce that by reducing social mixing and allow time to slow the virus down and get vaccine into more peopleaposs arms. Professor Paul Hunter, an epidemiologist based at the University of East Anglia, said Plan B was not enough to control Omicron.I am quite pessimistic that we could control the spread of omicron at present, he told Mail Online.  But I am hopeful that because we have both high vaccine coverage and high prior infection and because we are rolling out the booster dose better than virtually anywhere  we can at least manage the impact of the increase in omicron. I think plan B would be enough to push R below . for most delta, though uncertain it would stop AY.. — Delta plus. The new regulations will be put to a debate and vote in the Commons next week and with Labouraposs support they are certain to be approved, despite the prospect of a large Conservative revolt. Plan B is also facing criticism from those who believe it is too restrictive. Tory MP Marcus Fysh described plans to bring in Covid health certicates as really draconian and an utter disgrace.He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that vaccine passports are a massive imposition on our liberties.He added: Itaposs a disgrace that theyaposre pursuing that, utter disgrace. He accused Government scientic advisers and Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty of having a history of over-egging the data and picking data points out that suit their narrative. However, the Yeovil MP also suggested Omicron was proven to produce milder cases than Delta - a claim not backed by scientists.

Christopher Guest More was convicted of the murder of Brian Waters at Chester Crown Court on Monday, more than  years after the killing. On June   Mr Waters was tortured and killed on a farm in Tabley, close to junction  of the M. The court heard he was hung upside down by his ankles and brutally tortured inf front of his children, while his we Julie was abducted from the family home and driven to the farm. Mr Waters and farm worker Suleman Razak, who survived the four-hour ordeal, were tied up and suspended from rafters, beaten, and dropped in barrels of liquid.They were also burned with melting plastic, had staple guns used on their bodies and were assaulted with a metal bar. Mr Waters succumbed to more than  separate injuries, Chester Crown Court heard. When police arrived at the scene, following a call made from a phone box by Wilsonaposs driver David Moran, they found a bag containing cigarette ends, drinks bottles and even a bag of faeces which all had traces of Moreaposs DNA. The -year-old was arrested in  in Malta, where he had been living under the name Andrew Lamb, after being on the list of Europeaposs most wanted people. In early , he was extradited back to the UK and pleaded not guilty to murder as well as conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Razak. A jury in a previous trial, held at the same court earlier this year, then failed to reach a verdict. On Thursday, after  hours and  minutes of deliberations, the jury found More guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Razak, who worked on the cannabis farm. More, wearing a grey suit and white shirt, shook his head as the verdicts were ed. In May, a jury was discharged after it failed to agree on verdicts and a retrial began in November. More claimed he had befriended drug dealer John Wilson, one of three men already convicted of the murder, because he thought he could sell a story on him being a police informant to the media. He thought he might lead him to a cannabis farm which he could film for a Dispatches documentary.  Mr Waters, a cannabis dealer, who was growing the drug at the farm, owed Wilson a drugs debt of £,, the court heard. James Raven, who did television work with More, and Otis Matthews have also been convicted of murder at earlier trials. Giving evidence, More, who had been working as a yacht captain and businessman in Malta, claimed he had gone to the farm that morning to steal cannabis equipment. He said he left when he had an argument with Raven and realised Wilson, who was not at the scene, had discovered he was working undercover.  More then left the country for Spain two days later and, after travelling to South Africa, Mozambique and Turkey, settled in Malta. A Home Office post-mortem investigation of Mr Waters recorded a cause of death of multiple injuries.These included fractured ribs, a broken nose and breastbone, a bleed on the brain and bruising to the heart. Evidence of strangulation was also found, while he had suffered burns to his back from a caustic substance. He had also been attacked using the staple gun across his head and body.  Detective Inspector Kate Tomlinson, the senior investigating officer, said Mr Watersapos family continued to be affected by the crime. She said: They have remained very insular and havenapost been able to move on with their lives. They have remained very scared to this day because somebodyaposs been outstanding for the murder of their husband and father. A statement read by Mr Waters family, issued after the verdict, read: We are delighted with the guilty verdict and pleased that Christopher Guest More Jr is finally facing justice for his part in the horric murder of a loving husband and father. We would like to thank detectives from Cheshire Constabulary, the prosecution team and everyone  involved in the case for all of their hard work and tireless and extensive investigations, which now span more than  years.  We would also like to extend our thanks to the Family Liaison Officers for their help, advice and support over the years. What happened at Burnt House Farm on  June  has had a signicant and long-lasting effect on our family. We will never be able to forget events of that day and, even now, more than  years down the line, we feel the pain on a daily basis with constant flashbacks. We have remained a close-knit family and have provided much-needed support to each other – but this has been an isolating experience for us and not only have we lived in fear of reprisals we have also struggled to trust others as we normally would. It’s similar to the feelings people have experienced in the current COVID crisis – not being able to leave their home and having to stay inside to feel safe. We have been living like that for more than  years. But we never gave up hope and the verdict today marks the end of an incredibly painful journey in our lives. We would now ask that our privacy is respected and we are left alone as a family as we try and move forward with the next chapter of our lives. Judge Sir Peter Openshaw said More would be sentenced on Friday.

But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Once an initial course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy came to an end by the summer, the family were hopeful that things were looking up. Aged four and with her health much im­­­proved, Bella started school. But in April  things took another dev­­astating turn when she had a stroke. Beccy, who lives in Devon, says: “They found another tumour, this time on her brain. It was horrendous. She had gone from going to bed as usual to suddenly not being able to speak or walk. “She was paralysed down one side. They removed the tumour but there were still cancer cells left. Within a couple of weeks it was really hard to communicate with her and poor Bella would get frustrated.”  Weeks after the surgery, Beccy and Craig took their daughter home. Beccy says: “She was getting distressed in hospital so we brought her back to Plymouth. “She did a lot better and within a couple of weeks she was crawling round. As time went on, she was walking and talking more and more and most things really started to come back.” Although Bella was doing well, the family accepted that her condition could never be cured. But they hoped chemotherapy could slow the disease’s progress. Beccy recalls: “We continued that for a while. But it was no quality of le. “We decided to stop in July . “It was incredibly dficult but we knew the tumours would just grow. “We filled so much into that summer.” Beccy and Craig dreamed of sharing one last Christmas together as a family. Beccy, who runs a dog-walking business, adds: “The people at Make-A-Wish UK were amazing. They were able to move really quickly for us because we realised we didn’t have long. “Lots of our extended family got together at a big house in Challaborough, Devon, and we had our very own Christmas – in September. They had organised an amazing lunch cooked by two chefs at a local pub. There were presents for everyone, a tree, a huge snow globe and games for all. “Santa turned up and gave Bella her key with bells on and she loved listening to the sound as she shook it.” Looking back on those final days, Beccy says:“There’s no way we could have organised what they did. They did an incredible job in such a short time and treated us with such kindness. It’s something we’ll never forget.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Make A Wish Foundation United KingdomMake A Wish FoundationCancerMirror Christmas appealXmas Appeal Father Christmas\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Department for Work and Pensions approved Emad Al Swealmeen’s application even though it was previously ruled he could not stay in the UK.The decision could have made it easier for him to build the lestyle to plot and fund the ball bearing-filled device, which almost killed expectant mums and their babies, LiverpoolECHO reports. Al Swealmeen was handed a National Insurance number by the DWP in November , it was reported. At the time, he was living in specialist asylum accommodation in Liverpool and it was the same home where counter-terror detectives found “suspicious items” in the aftermath of the Remembrance Sunday explosion.  It is alleged Government agencies knew where Al Swealmeen was living and were in communication with him despite having rejected his bid to remain four years earlier. It is understood that Al Swealmeen’s successful National Insurance application may have come after he was granted the right to work. This permission could have been grantedthose vetting him didnapost find his failed asylum application from . However, it is thought that Al Swealmeen made at least one further bid for asylum, which was knocked back in . The Government explains on its website: “The Home Office may grant permission to work to asylum seekers whose claim has been outstanding for more than  months through no fault of their own.”  The then Immigration Minister Caroline Noakes confirmed this process in April , seven months before Al Swealmeen was told his National Insurance application had been successful. If his later application had been hit with administrative delays he could have taken advantage to be able to work get permission to work while he waited for a decision. If had done this he would have only had the right to work in jobs that feature on the Shortage Occupation List.  Details of what Al Swealmeen did in Liverpool are scarce, but it is known to have worked in a takeaway in Sefton in  and enrolled on a cake decorating course at the City of Liverpool College in . While a National Insurance number is not proof of the right to stay in the UK, it is likely to boost his credibility when applying for roles, it was reported. Home Office statistics showed , claims had been waiting for more than six months at the end of September . The Refugee Council branded the system as “ineffective and riddled with backlogs”.  Questions over the circumstances of Al Swealmean’s immigration status and whether problems with assessing his latest asylum application gave him the opportunity to work and receive a National Insurance number are likely to be asked. There are more questions over how he was able to fund his bomb-making plot. Al Swealmeen is known to have begun renting a flat in April  and counter-terror police believe that is when he had started plotting his bomb attack.  This was the property in which he is believed to have turned into a bomb-producing lair and where he was picked up from in a taxi that he later blew up in the hospital car park, killing himself and injuring driver David Perry. Detectives have said the explosion could have been far more serious, with Counter Terror Police North West revealing: It was made using homemade explosive and had ball bearings attached to it which would have acted as shrapnel. Had it detonated in dferent circumstances we believe it would have caused signicant injury or death.” It is not known when or how he was radicalised.  It is understood he arrived in the UK in  and lodged an asylum claim, in which an applicant must be able to show they have left their country and are unable to go back “because you fear persecution”. It was unsuccessful and an appeal was refused. A judge threw out the challenge after concluding there were no grounds to overturn the decision in . This meant that Al Swealmeen, who was born in Iraq, did not have the right to stay in the UK. In the same year, he was baptised but also appeared before Liverpool Magistrates’ Court and admitted a charge of possession of a blade in a public place.  Reports suggest he was handed a conditional discharge, but it is believed he was also sectioned shortly afterwards.Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, which provides most of the specialist mental health care in the city, has confirmed he had accessed its services but was not a service user at the time of his death.It was around this time Al Swealmeen was taken in by Malcolm and Elizabeth Hitchcott, a devout Christian couple for around eight months. They said he converted from Islam to Christianity and he was confirmed in , but lost touch with the church in . The Hitchcotts said Al Swealmeen would sometimes go by the alias Enzo Almeni due to his love of Italian car racing legend Enzo Ferrari and to appear “more Western” in his asylum bid. However, his application for a National Insurance number was made under his birth name, and not his ‘Westernised’ alias, the ECHO understands, and was submitted after he had moved into Sutclfe Street accommodation provided to him. The ECHO approached the Home Office with details of Al Swealmeen’s National Insurance number claim but the organisation declined to comment.

Ian Bennett, , kned Kerry Woolley, also , to death at her flat in Olton, Solihull, West Midlands, on July  last year after ly accusing her of sleeping with another woman. A post mortem revealed that Ms Woolley had suffered more than  kne wounds, most inflicted on her neck. Bennett then roped his mother Lynda Bennett, , into a cowardly plot to help him conceal the crime. She drove him to a canal bridge to dispose of the murder weapons.  But the plan backfired when dash cam footage from her own car helped convict the pair in court. Other evidence found on Bennettaposs phone found that he had researched: The best way to get revenge on a woman. Bennett, of Solihull, was found guilty of murder at Birmingham Crown Court and was jailed for le and ordered to serve a minimum of  years. His mother Lynda was convicted of assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice was sentenced to three years in prison. The court was told how Bennett had called  on the afternoon of the murder, telling officers he had found mum-of-two Kerry with catastrophic wounds to her neck.  He claimed he had left the flat in the early hours of July  and had then been unable to get back in contact with Kerry. Police bodycam footage captured Bennettaposs crocodile tears as he tells cops: Iaposve been trying to call and ring her all day, no answers. So I thought Iaposd knock on. The door wasnapost open so I had to pull the handle and then I walked into that...found her dead. He then points at the door and sobs: Itaposs horric. Although initially no weapon could be located Bennett was arrested on suspicion of murder. His mum was also captured on camera calmly arriving at the scene to ask police why her son was being arrested despite knowing full well what had happened. At one point she even laughs when an officer tells her Bennett is being taken to a station in Coventry and she scoffs: I donapost know how to get to Coventry. Officers analysed text messages between the couple, who only met a few weeks before, which suggested there had been a falling out a couple of days earlier. Bennett appeared to be angry, accusing Kerry of cheating on him, although this was groundless, and that she was also messaging a former partner.  Mobile phone data also revealed that both Bennettaposs and Kerryaposs phones went apossilentapos around .pm on July , despite being in regular contact previously. Bennettaposs phone did become active again at .am, when he made attempts to contact her, knowing that she was in fact already dead. A dashcam in Lyndaaposs car revealed it had left the address Bennett shared with his parents and took a  minute journey round Solihull. Cell site data retrieved from her phone was consistent with Lynda being the driver of the car. The vehicle firstly stopped on Damson Lane, where CCTV footage clearly showed Bennett throwing a bundle into the canal. A large kne with a bent blade was later recovered during a search of the water.  The car then stopped near shops at Prospect Lane, and again CCTV picked up Bennett, carrying a plastic bag into parkland before ing to the car without the bag. Another search of the park land resulted in a bag being recovered and inside were blood-stained womenaposs jogging bottoms and a pair of oven gloves. Forensic examinations later matched Sarahaposs DNA to both the kne from the canal and the blood-stained items found in the park. Two knives had been used, one with a serrated blade, the second with a smooth blade.

A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said they would ask people to park “considerately” and respect all road users. “If people park illegally they can be fined,” they said. “We would also ask people to consider other forms of transport, such as bus and trains, or walking and cycling where possible.You may find the BCC parking website a useful resource:Parking | Birmingham City CouncilRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingBabiesBad Parking\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m always forgetting where I left my phoneor wedding ring . And I’ve even lost my teenage daughter several times but, sadly, she found me again. Now that I’m , I often worry whether my forgetfulness is a sign of early dementia. I asked my -year-old mumthere was any Alzheimer’s in our family and she looked confused and said she didn’t remember, which could be a worrying sign. But now a new early test, invented by UK firm Cognetivity Neurosciences, can predict the likelihood of getting dementia and multiple sclerosis later in le. Cognetivity’s Integrated Cognitive Assessmenttakes five minutes and gives an accurate measure of brain .  I was a bit worried when I was asked to the take it. Did I really want to know what my chances of getting dementia were  In the UK there are more than , people with dementia, and the Alzheimer’s Society projects this will rise to . million by .CognICA could soon be available at your GP surgery along with the other tests for over-s, and will be as simple as getting your blood pressure checked.Dr Tom Sawyer, boss of Cognetivity Neurosciences, explains: “One of the biggest factors in getting dementia is age, so it makes sense to have a test once you get past a certain age, like . Our test can spot early signs of deterioration.” The test has already been rolled out in a few NHS Trusts, so the laborious, expensive traditional diagnosis screening could soon be replaced by a quick, cheap tool.Currently, memory clinics screen people who are already cognitively impaired, or who have been referred by their families for becoming forgetful. Dr Sawyer adds: “Then there are the patients who’ve just forgotten where they’ve parked their car. They panic and demand to be referred and a specialist has to spend hours with them, at a cost of thousands of pounds, to find there’s nothing wrong with them.” Using the CognICA test on an iPad, the company claims doctors will be able to measure brain health and spot signs of dementia long before symptoms appear.  Dr Sawyer says: “Early detection means better treatment, the cost of which over a letime will be dramatically cheaper.” I’ve never taken a serious health scan before, except for blood pressure, so I was nervous to do the test. Holding the iPad, my palms began sweating and I fluffed step one – entering my name and age – and had to start again. The test measures your reactions to a fast-changing picture on screen for speed and accuracy. You tap right for a picture with an animal and left for anything . Instructions flashed up quickly, sending my thumbs flailing. After a couple of trials, the test began and a series of images started appearing so fast that at first I kept making mistakes. Luckily the system allows for errors and I have been schooled in gaming by my daughter Jesse, so although you can’t cheat the test,you’ve got quick thumbs you’re already one step ahead. The speed at which your brain recognises pictures is a measure of its health but the test tricks you with unrecognisable images. Halfway through I started to relax and enjoy the test, and at the end I was shocked to find I scored %. I felt like celebrating with a gin and tonic but it turns out that’s the last thing my brain needs. Dr Sawyer explains: “Anything below % is cause for concern. But, like a blood pressure test, a raised result doesn’t mean you’re going to die from it. If you get an early indication, you can address it by changing your lestyle.” Although there’s no magic bullet, things like more exercise and not smoking and drinking so much all slow brain deterioration. And Dr Sawyer says Aduhelm – a disease-modying drug for Alzheimer’s approved in the US – could be a “game-changer for people with early stage dementia”. Later I told my daughter what my CognICA score was. She said: “Cool, that means in gaming you’re POG.

It has been reported that father and son have barely spoken over the last eight months and that relations between them are at an all-time low. It is alleged the pair have had only a few fraught conversations on the phone since Harry and we Meghan Markle quit their roles as senior royals and moved to Calornia in .Earlier this week, Harry said he severed ties with Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz a year before he was presented the CBE by Charles.  The Duke of Sussex reportedly had concerns over the businessman’s motives as he donated large sums to Charlesaposs charity. The prince then gave Mr Mahfouz - who denies any wrongdoing - a CBE in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in . And Harryaposs comments have been seen by some as one-upmanship over his father as the royal rt between the prince and his family continues.

According to royal expert Camilla Tominey, those who know Charles say he wonapost be angry with the comments - just sad.Writing in the , she says one former aide told her: The prince absolutely adores Harry. He will feel absolutely devastated by this distraught.He’ll be beside himselfthis means he also becomes more ostracised from his grandchildren. It’s such a sad state of affairs.  Next year, Harry is set to release a tell-all memoir, which he promises will be a wholly-truthful and accurate account of his le so far. And author Andrew Morton, who famously wrote a biography on Princess Diana, says that Charles could be in the firing line again when Harryaposs book is published.He told the Royally Us podcast: If I was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a pile of coats to hide under. Because I think that the book that’s going to come out next year is written by someone who spends a lot of time investigating father-son relationships because he ghost-wrote a book on Andre Agassi, who had a dficult relationship with his father. So I think we’re going to see Charles once more in the firing line. SoI was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a hard hat and a flak jacket.But according to The Sun, Charles, , is keeping a dignied silence about his relationship with his son.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

According to reports, she is planning to host her family at her Norfolk estate and may even appear in public for the first time in months. The royals normally walk to a Christmas Day church service, though in recent years the Queen has arrived by car.  The monarch has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back. She is also preparing to film her Christmas Day message to the nation.Now the Mail Online reports that she has been given the go-ahead by doctors to throw her annual private pre-festive season party for extended family members.The outlet says it will take place at Windsor Castle instead of Buckingham Palace, where it has traditionally been held.

She will also reportedly move her court to her Sandringham Estate in Norfolk for Christmas, where her closest will gather in time for Christmas Eve. The Queen is set to fly to East Anglia by helicopter, rather than take the train, due to her age and health, it is reported. It is also claimed that palace aides are looking at options for the monarch to appear in public over the next two weeks. A source claimed: It won’t be a normal Christmas, but like many families around the country, it will be as normal as it can get.  It comes after several of her royal engagements were cancelled and the Queen, who has recently used a walking stick for the first time on royal visits, also spent a night in hospital. She was forced to pull out of the Remembrance Sunday service at the cenotaph in London after spraining her back. Buckingham Palace issued a statement on her behalf at the time expressing her disappointment for not being able to attend the event to commemorate all the men and women who served in the First World War.

Astronomers described the spectacular fireworks show as troubling - warning a similar event could hit Earth. It would fry satellites in orbit and crash power grids serving entire cities - causing widespread blackouts and knocking out phone networks. The star is named EK Draconis - Latin for dragon. And it is breathing fire. It lies in the constellation of Draco in the far northern sky. Known as a CME , the sun shoots out such eruptions on a regular basis. They are made up of clouds of extremely-hot particles, or plasma, that hurtle through space at millions of miles an hour.And they are potentially bad news. Every  years or so, they are released in our direction. Co-author Dr Yuta Notsu, of the University of Colorado Boulder, said: Coronal mass ejections can have a serious impact on Earth and human society. The international team observed the astonishing burst of energy pouring out of EK Draconis. It was much more powerful than any seen before. Experts fear a catastrophic solar storm will hit us - by the end of the century. Study leader Kosuke Namekata, a PhD student at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, said it could be just as strong. The researchers used ground and space-based telescopes to peer at EK Draconis - which resembles a young version of the sun. It emitted a mass of scorching plasma in the quadrillions of kilograms - over ten times bigger than the previous record from a sun-like star. Dr Notsu said: It may serve as a warning of just how dangerous the weather in space can be.This kind of big mass ejection could, theoretically, also occur on our Sun. This observation may also help us to better understand how similar events may have affected Earth and even Mars over billions of years. He explained CMEs often occur right after a star lets loose a flare or sudden and bright burst of radiation that can extend far out into space. An earlier study by the same group found young sun-like stars around the galaxy experience frequent apossuperflaresapos. They are like our own solar flares - but tens or even hundreds of times more potent. Such a superflare could, theoretically, also happen on Earthaposs sun - and lead to an equally enormous CME. Dr Notsu said: Superflares are much bigger than the flares we see from the sun. So we suspect they would also produce much bigger mass ejections. But until recently, that was just conjecture.  He described EK Draconis as a curious star. It is about the same size as the sun - but just  million years old. Dr Notsu said: It is what our sun looked like . billion years ago. The researchers watched the star for  nights in winter and spring last year.They scanned it with NASA aposs TESSand Japanaposs SEIMEI telescopes.On April , they got lucky as EK Draconis erupted into a superflare - a really big one. Half an hour later, a CME flew from the staraposs surface. The researchers were only able to catch the first step in its le - the aposfilament eruptionapos phase. But even so, it was a monster - moving at a top speed of roughly one million miles per hour. It does not bode well for le on Earth. The findings in Nature Astronomy hint the sun is also capable of such violent extremes. But, looking on the bright side, super CMEs are probably rarer in older stars. They may have been much more common in the early years of the solar system. Gigantic coronal mass ejections, in other words, could have helped to shape planets like Earth and Mars into what they look like today.  Dr Notsu said: The atmosphere of present-day Mars is very thin compared to Earthaposs. In the past, we think Mars had a much thicker atmosphere. Coronal mass ejections may help us understand what happened to the planet over billions of years. Two years ago researchers at the US Geological Survey predicted a solar storm could hit us at any moment - with no guarantee weaposll spot it coming. They examined an event now known as the New York Railroad Storm, which plunged large parts of the northeastern United States into darkness in May . According to the report, several gigantic CMEs bombarded Earth at once - juicing up Earthaposs magnetic field and causing widespread destruction. If it happened in the modern world, the cost would run into trillions of dollars. In , a huge CME which could have decimated electronics missed the Earth by just nine days. The event was comparable to the  Carrington Event, in which telegraph operators suffered electric shocks and sparks exploded from pylons.

In the two weeks to Sunday  December, there were  confirmed cases of the new iant in West Northamptonshire and eight confirmed cases in Croydon, Hackney, Lambeth, Newham and Lewisham. Seven confirmed Omicron cases were detected in Brent, Buckinghamshire, Greenwich, plus six in Wandsworth.  In addition, genomic testing had discovered cases where there had been a “S gene drop-out”in the virus that is not seen in the Delta iant and is likely to be a proxy for Omicron. The “majority” of the  suspected Omicron cases were located in London and the South East, the report said. In the week to Sunday, there were  such cases in West Northamptonshire,  in Lewisham,  in Buckinghamshire,  in Newham, nine in Greenwich, eight in Lambeth, seven in Brent, six in Hackney and Wandsworth and two in Croydon.  The UKHSA has estimated that the true number of infections will be approximately  times higher than the number of confirmed cases.Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the real number of Omicron caseswas “probably closer to ,”.Delta cases had doubled in around seven days, he continued, but for Omicron “based on the latest data from here and around the world, our latest analysis is that it’s been around, it’s between two-and-a-half and three days”.  At the current observed doubling rate of two-and-a-half to three days, he estimated that cases could exceed one million by the end of the month. Meanwhile, new figures show London, eastern England and the South East are seeing their highest case rates since January. In the South East, a total of . new cases per , people were recorded in the week to  December - the highest since  January.  Eastern England is at . cases per ,, its highest rate since the week to  January.

Masks were already mandatory in some places, such as shops, supermarkets and on public transport, before Mr Johnson announced his aposPlan Bapos on Wednesday.Under the new measures, face coverings must now be worn in England in cinemas, hairdressers, theatres, places of worship, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo studios and some other settings. The NHS Covid Pass will be required for entry to nightclubs and venues with large crowds inside. People in England are also being advised to work from homethey can as part of a bid to drive down coronavirus cases. However, the good news is that families will still be able to come together for Christmas dinner and friends can gather at the pub for a festive drink. What are the new rules From December , face coverings must be worn in most public indoor settings in England, including cinemas, hairdressers, theatres and places of worship. It will also become the law to wear them in nail salons, massage centres, tattoo studios, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors, accountants and during driving tests and lessons, Under Plan B, the NHS Covid Pass will also become a requirement for entry to nightclubs and venues with large crowds inside from December . This includes unseated indoor events with  or more people and unseated outdoor venues with , or more iniduals present.New rules also say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days.  How is this dferent from the existing rules  Since November , it has been mandatory to wear masks in shops, supermarkets and on public transport but this rule has now been extended.The Prime Minister did not add any additional travel rules, although these were tightened last month. Arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world are now forced to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival. They must also isolate until the result comes back negative. Since December , people flying back to the UK are also required to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight. The NHS Covid Pass rule for nightclubs is also a sht, with people previously able to show a negative test to enter.  Can I still go to the pub and enjoy Christmas dinner with my family  Yes, pubs will remain open under the plans and you will be able to meet your loved ones for Christmas dinner. There is no indication that the Rule of Six will , meaning there are no limits on social gatherings inside or outside. Boris Johnson rejected the suggestion that festive parties and nativity plays should be cancelled during Wednesdayaposs Downing Street press conference. It means parties are allowed but office work is discouraged.Last Christmas the rules looked very dferent, with a tiered system of restrictions in place across England. People were told to stay at home in London, south-east and east England as they were placed in Tier . Households in other parts of the country were allowed to mix on December , although long-distance travel was discouraged. This year it looks like the rules will not be as strict, although the Prime Minister has refused to rule out a Christmas lockdown so there is still a chance things could change.

Belle Parri, , cheated her own grieving siblings out of £, from the sale of her parents’ house. A court heard she planned on becoming a bar owner - and defrauded her sisters from their rightful inheritance. A family feud developed after her parents George and Linda Slack died within a fortnight of each other in . Parri had been named executor and trustee of their wills - and was obliged to ide the £, proceeds of a house sale up with her two sisters. But instead she transferred the property in Runcorn, Cheshire, into her own name and tried to remortgage it to buy a nightclub.  Prosecutor James Coutts said sisters Caroline Skye and Victoria Kennedy were conned out of thousands - along with four grandchildren who also stood to inherit smaller amounts. Mr Coutts said: “Instead she decided to buy a bar in Denbigh.” He said: “She told her family in no uncertain terms. This was something she was arranging the finance for herself. She assured them it was nothing to do with their parents’ house.” Caernarfon Crown Court heard Parri - known to her family as Alison - was discovered when another family member opened a letter from a finance company. Parri admitted four charges of fraud. Her sister Caroline said Parri had embarked on a “get rich quick scheme” which she had kept secret. She said: “I am determined to be free of her toxic influence.” Sister Victoria said the frauds were a “malignant effort by Alison to orce me from my family”. Speaking after the case, she added: “This is a very complex case.” She described Parri as “low, petty, jealous and controlling” and added: “She really is a piece of work”. Dafydd Roberts, defending, said the fraud was “putting a property at risk of loss, rather than loss.” Judge Nicola Saffman said Parri had show “an entire lack of remorse.” Parri, of Runcorn, was jailed for  months.

Rich German and Matt Wheaton were paddle boarding when they encountered an enormous sunfish. They were in the US city of Laguna Beach, Calornia when they made the freaky discovery.Mr German said: “My buddy, Matt, and I were just paddling and came across it… it was hard to miss! It was nine to  feet long, way bigger than myself.“It’s hard to compare a sunfish to other creatures because they are so bizarre looking – they look like a mutilated shark that got bitten in half. I’ve seen many over the years but this was definitely the biggest.”  The world’s largest bony fish by weight was another sunfish caught in  off Kamogawa – a city in Chiba, Japan, says the Guinness World Records. It weighed ,kg and measured ft in long – and though the two men didn’t measure the fish they encountered, they’re confident it was bigger. “Well we didn’t catch it or have a measuring tape but the largest sunfish on record is ft in,” said Rich, . “Matt’s board is ft long, he added, andyou look at the pics you can see for yourself how big it looks.  I would guess it was at least nine to  feet long… my buddy and I were blown away when we saw it.” Julianne Steers of Beach Ecology Coalition said there was only one way to say for sureit was a record-breaking specimen. “The only true way to know isit was out [of the water] and weighed and officially measured,” she told the OC Register. “But it does look much larger than what we typically see out here.”  Mr German, who founded Project O – a non-profit organisation dedicated to ocean conservation – has been out in the water almost every day for over a decade. But this encounter shows that, even for him, the sea still holds surprises. He said: “I’ve been paddling here in Laguna Beach pretty much every day for the past  years and I’ve had over , encounters with dolphins and whales. “This was more proof that you never know what you will see out on the ocean!” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON World recordsSharksDolphinsBig Fish\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A judge in upstate New York has ruled that attorney Jeannie Figer is permitted to vaccinate her -year-old child despite her dadaposs reluctance.Scientist Donald Figer - who has been jabbed - didnapost want her to have the shot due to a lack of studies into the long-term side effects of the vaccine on children.The legal papers say the dad works as a scientist and college professor at one of the areaaposs premier institutions, DailyMail reports.At Monroe County Supreme Court, Judge Richard Dollinger, said that the dadaposs plan to wait for research could put the girl at risk. In his ruling, he said: aposWaiting — to be apossure,apos as the father asks — is simply untenable, when the specter of a killing or incapacitating disease is swirling in the environment surrounding this young girl.  Scientists may never catch up to this ever-evolving and elusive virus and iants.

Jeannie was ordered to arrange a jab for as soon as possible. Itaposs unknown whether the girl attended an appointment after the ruling.  The judge added that Covid cases in Monroe County are currently surging. The area has had the second-highest rolling seven-day average of infections daily since November .

Jenny Marr, , initially thought she was carrying one child before a sonographer delivered the le-changing news at her -week scan. The mum-of-fouraposs husband Chris turned a ghostly shade of white and fainted when the doctor said they were expecting multiples.Jenny, who lives in Texas, US, told The Sun : Le has completely changed for Chris and I now that we suddenly have four babies to look after.We go through . gallons of milk every couple of days, and I do try and cook homemade food, but sometimes I’m so exhausted that I just heat up something that’s frozen for Chris and I to eat. The couple, who met in a local pub, decided it was time to try for a baby after enjoying holidays and time relaxing together.  They stopped using contraception and let nature take its course.In six months, Jenny had her positive pregnancy test and they were both thrilled.But at  weeks gone, she went for a scan where they were confronted with some le-changing news. After becoming worried by the sonographer looking intently at the screen, the couple were told they were expecting triplets. Chris turned a ghostly shade of white and with a thump, he passed out on the floor, Jenny said.  She added: I was still lying on the scanning table in complete shock too. I had thought I was pregnant with just one baby, now I was being told there was three in there. They had to follow up with a specialist, who added another baby to the sonographeraposs prediction. Rather than fainting, the couple both laughed this time. Jenny said she was glad it was four babies because sheaposs never liked odd numbers. Making their case even rarer was the fact that they were all identical - a  million to one chance. But the rarity of the pregnancy also made it risky. Chris was told there was less than a . per cent chance of all surviving but withheld that awful secret from Jenny through the entirety of her pregnancy. Jenny feared being told one of the infants had died every time she went for a scan. But at each scan, there were the four little heartbeats pumping strongly away. They were really hanging on by a miracle, she said. She went for her weekly scan in March at  weeks pregnant and was told everything was fine. Two days later she woke up just after midnight having contractions.  She was going into labour, so Chris and her mum rushed her to hospital where the little ones were delivered by caesarian section. Harrison weighed lb, Hardy at lb, Henry at lb and finally Hudson at lb. The smallest boy, Hudson, was the only one who didnapost need oxygen support after the birth. They were so little that they had to be tube fed and stayed in hospital until May. It’s been one whirlwind of nappy changing, feeding and sleeping, Jenny told The Sun. She said it was hard at first to tell who was who, but as they grow older they each have inidual faces. She said: And their personalities tell them apart. Harrison is the big brother and likes all the attention, Hardy is so funny and relaxed, he just goes with the flow. Henry has an infectious smile and loves going outside, and Hudson is the little mother hen, and is always checking everyone is ok. Jenny said she and Chris feel like the luckiest mum and dad in the world after delivering their  million to one miracles.

Condensation occurs when water in the warm air hits a cold pane of glass and turns to liquid. If too much water gathers on the surface, you can end up with mould, which can be dangerous to your healththe problem isnapost solved.One woman who had this very problem took to Facebook to ask for advice. Sophie Randell made her plea for help in the Mrs Hinch Cleaning Tips group where she said sheaposs having condensation issues after moving into a new rented property.She said: Just moved into a rented property and without a fail every day the windows have condensation like this, I’ve tried the littlepots shown in the picture to help but it’s made zero dference. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Any advice on how to stop this would be brill! It even leaks water onto the window seal some days from how much condensation there is. Group members rushed to share their tips, tricks and advice in the comments in the hopes of fixing Sophieaposs problem, with the most popular suggestion being salt, which costs only p in Asda for a large pot. One person said: Put salt in a bowl on the window sill. It will draw the damp to it. I’d recommend that too, wrote another.  Buying a humidier was another popular option - but instead of splashing out on one right on top of Christmas, a third commented: Grab a big plastic tub and make your own dehumidier by putting cat litter or salt or even sugar in it - anything that will absorb moisture. A few people suggested that she open her windows in the morning for an hour or so and put the heating on, and this should sort the problem right out. If you find this makes the house too cold, you could just open them for five minutes a few times a day. Others also urged Sophie not to dry her clothes inside either, as this can make the problem worse.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

It was dark in colour and resembled a Batman mask covering large parts of her young faceLittle Luna before her surgery Image: Carolina Fenner  SWNS.COMByKelly-Ann MillsReporter:,  Dec | commentsA two-year-old girl who had a birthmark on her face which resembled a Batman mask has had it removed in a pioneering operation. Little Luna Taes-Fenner had a huge nevus birthmark covering her nose and eyelids, and had made regular visits from her home in Florida to Russia to have treatment. She had been receiving photodynamic therapy - a treatment not yet available in the US. Her doctor Pavel Popov said: “Luna has already started speaking and she says herself: ‘My black spot has gone. I am a princess’.” The surgery took place at a clinic in Krasnodar - a Russian city close to Ukraine amid high tension between the two countries.  And there has been a heartwarming result from the Russian medical treatment, which medics say has prevented possible skin cancer for the toddler. We only had six operations to remove the nevus and have succeeded in making it disappear,” Dr Popov said. “The main medical part of the task is done. This does not mean that we have finished treatment. “We are letting Luna rest from the treatment she has undergone and then we will undertake the aesthetic surgeries. “Later we aim to make sure Luna will not have any complexes when she comes to the age where she is concerned about her appearance.” The doctor had no hesitation in saying the treatment was a “success”. “I am completely satisfied with the result of the surgery,” he said. “Luna is very loyal to us. Often there is an aversion to the medical staff. “Children are afraid of doctors, but Luna brings her dolls to the appointment every time and asks me to treat their faces. “I attach a plaster to the dollaposs face. Luna is happy that the doll is also treated. “I guess the lack of pain in the treatment allows her to be so loyal.

The girl’s mother said she was grateful for the treatment not involving an invasive and “aggressive” surgery, which would have been the case where. Luna is good now,” she said. Her bandages are off. “Weaposre going to fly away for Christmas and come back for the final cosmetic surgeries at the end of January. “I don’t regret at all having the treatment here. Luna doesnapost feel the pain. She dances a few hours after the surgery.” Carolina, a US citizen originally from Brazil, and her husband Thiago Taes, , raised tens of thousands of dollars for their daughter’s treatment in Krasnodar and also had the support of an anonymous Russian donor which they called a “miracle”.

People aged  and under in  will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes in the Pacic country of five million, part of proposals unveiled on Thursday that will also curb the number of retailers authorised to sell tobacco and cut nicotine levels in all products. “We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth,” New Zealand Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall said in a statement. “If nothing changes, it would be decades till Māori smoking rates fall below %, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind.” How will New Zealandaposs smoking ban for young people work  Currently, .% of all New Zealanders aged over  smoke, a proportion that rises to % among indigenous Maori adults, according to government figures. The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of .  The restrictions would then be rolled out in stages from , beginning with a sharp reduction in the number of authorised sellers, followed by reduced nicotine requirements in  and the creation of the “smoke-free” generation from . The package of measures will make New Zealand’s retail tobacco industry one of the most restricted in the world, just behind Bhutan where cigarette sales are banned outright. New Zealand’s neighbour Australia was the first country in the world to mandate plain packaging of cigarettes in . The New Zealand government said while existing measures like plain packaging and levies on sales had slowed tobacco consumption, the tougher steps were necessary to achieve its goal of fewer than % of the population smoking daily by . The new rules would halve the country’s smoking rates in as few as  years from when they take effect, the government said. Smoking kills about , people a year in New Zealand, making it one of the country’s top causes of preventable death. Four in five smokers started before age , the country’s government said. Vaping, often seen as a safer alternative to smoking and a useful aid to quitting, is also tightly regulated with sales only allowed to over s. Health authorities welcomed the crackdown, while retailers and tobacco companies expressed concern about the impact on their businesses and warned of the emergence of a black market. “We welcome the New Zealand government’s recognition that excessive excise increases disproportionately impact smokers on lower incomes,” tobacco group Imperial Brands said, adding it was concerned about proposals to reduce nicotine levels and eventually prohibit sales. “Prohibitions of any kind tend to play into the hands of criminal traders who peddle unregulated illicit products,” it also said. Dunhill maker British American Tobaccoand Marlboro maker Philip Morris, which has previously said it would stop sales in the countryrequired by law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  According to brokerage Citi, BAT is the market leader in New Zealand, with a % share by volume, while Imperial Brands, which sells JPS, Riverstone and Horizon cigarettes, accounts for %, generating about -% of its group earnings before taxes. The government did not detail how the new rules would be policed or whether they would apply to visitors to the country. “Cigarette smoking kills  New Zealanders every day and two out of three smokers will die as a result of smoking,” said New Zealand Medical Association chair Alistair Humphrey in a statement. “This action plan offers some hope of realising our  Smokefree Aotearoa goal, and keeping our tamarikismokefree.” However, the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, said while it supported a smoke-free country, the government’s plan would destroy many businesses. “This is all  per cent theory and zero per cent substance,” the group’s chairman, Sunny Kaushal, told Stuff.co.nz. “There’s going to be a crime wave.

Five attackers showed up at the four-star Oasis Palm hotel in Cancun, Mexico on jet skis before opening fire, Lucio Hernández Gutiérrez, the chief of police of the coastal state of Quintana Roo, said. The jet skis were found a mile away on a beach and seized. Rick Lebassa, an American tourist who witnessed the terrying attack, said two or three gunmen appeared to be shooting into the air with pistols. He said: “There were two guys and maybe even a third, who came in on jet skis, and what I saw was them shooting up into the sky.  “I did not see any shots coming in toward the shoreline.” Andy Guyrich and Kerry Arms, who were also visiting from the US, described the scene. He said: “We just had to hit the deck.” Kerry added: “There was a delayed reaction for about maybe five seconds, then everybody started scrambling and screaming and crying, and running. The terrying shooting is the latest in a series of incidents in the tourist hotspot in the same week.  Footage shows a special battalion of National Guard troops patrolling the beach after they were assigned to protect the area. They are seen with bulletproof vests, helmets and assault rles while walking through the crowded beach. It comes after how hero hotel guests brandished poles as a rain of gunfire killed two near a Day of the Dead party in Mexico.  The rain of bullets caused hotel guests to run for cover after a fight broke out between drug gangs on a beach at the Hyatt Ziva Riviera resort. Former NBC executive Mike Sington, who is staying at the resort told how guests were relaxing on the beach and playing volleyball when the incident happened.He posted on Twitter : Guests are telling me they were playing volleyball on the beach, gunman approached firing gun. The holiday horror saw some guests run for cover, but others grabbed poles ready to defend themselves against the cartel attack. One tourist told CNN: I was by the pool when multiple successive gunshots occurred. It went on for a little while and everyone dove for cover. We manned the entrances to the basement and were given metal sticks, even a pedestal bathroom sink, to defend ourselves.

Harrowing CCTV shows the moment the suspect is then seen running towards his gravely-wounded victim seconds before he stabs her, it is alleged. Eyewitnesses seen running from the attacker called police who later detained a man identied as -year-old Tolibchon Aminov. He is now under criminal investigation for rape, attempted murder and the kidnapping of two other women, aged  and , who were tied up with duct tape in the apartment from which victim had jumped.  The suspect was shown at a crime reenactment at the spot where the woman fell telling investigators: I stabbed her twice. With a kne. This way. Then I ran away.” He demonstrates on a mannequin how he allegedly attacked the woman. The Russian Investigative Committee said Aminov - whose job was renovating flats - “used violence against [the woman] and beat her up, after which he raped her.  “The victim, fleeing from the accused, jumped from the height of the fourth floor. “The man, with intent to kill her looked for a sharp object, went downstairs and inflicted multiple wounds on her, after which he fled.” The -year-old woman is in a “serious” condition in hospital with a fractured pelvis and stab wounds. The suspect, a Tajikistan citizen, has been detained for two months pending further investigations.

She has marked her burnversary by reflecting on the day her family was ripped apartStephanie Browitt suffered burns to  per cent of her bodyByLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsA burn survivor who lost her sister and father to a volcano eruption has marked her “burnversary” by reflecting on the day her family were “ripped apart”. Stephanie Browitt, , was with her sister Krystal, , and dad Paul, when a volcano erupted on the coast of Whakatane on New Zealand’s North Island on December , . Stephanie survived with third-degree burns to  per cent of her body but her sister and Paul were killed along with  other people on the island at the time. Her mother Marie had stayed behind on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship and watched on helplessly as tragedy struck. Stephanie, who now wears a protective face mask, posted photos of her family on Thursday to mark the occasion.  She wrote: “Today marks two years since the incident my family and I were a part of. The day that ripped us apart. For a lot of burn survivors they call it their “burnversary”, a day where they can celebrate their achievements, accomplishments and the fact that they survived such awful tragedy’s on this very date. “I truly want to celebrate all that I have accomplished since I was severely burnt, just like other burn survivors do.  “Unfortunately today’s not only the day I survived the unimaginable, it’s the day I lost my dad, Paul and sister, Krystal. It’s the day that they were taken from us.” Stephanie, who has become an advocate for burns survivors since the incident, said her accomplishments mean nothing” when she cannot share them with her lost loved ones. She continued: “Everyday I question why we couldn’t have gone through this extremely hard journey together, why they couldn’t be here also.  “I’m extremely grateful that I was able to make it back home to my mum, but I’m also heartbroken that only I made it back. We are a family of four, not two. “My heart hurts when I remember what I felt that day, but it hurts more not knowing what my dad and sister felt, that I wasn’t next to them during their last moments.” She described the past two years as a period of “loss, pain and never ending grief” and said she missed her dad and sister every day “so much it kills me”.  In November , New Zealand’s workplace safety watchdog charged  parties - including tour operators and the island’s owners - with failings. All defendants have pleaded not guilty but they could be liable for millions of dollars in fines.

ldquoWersquore very pleased to see the UK finally promising this kind of action ndash doesnrsquot go as far as wersquod like it to go, but itrsquos certainly a very big step in the right

value for wildle is to allow relatively wealthy, western hunters to pay to kill it.Mr Goncalves said: ldquoMy ideal would have been a total ban, butwe were to score this like a school paper, I would give it an A-.He said he hoped the bill would initiate international action, with Britain working with other countries to call for an end to trophy hunting world wide.To raise pressure on MPs to enforce the ban, his Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting is sending them a book with photos of British hunters and their spoils.He said: ldquoThere is sometimes a misperception that trophy hunting is what

ldquoThe alarming acceleration of bank branch closures has left many people who depend on them for essential banking services at risk of being cut adrt, which seems to fly in the face of work being

been carried out ndash leaving the roads and pedestrian networks around the area at breaking point.Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell told the planning committee at its online meeting on

usual to use decade-old figures for determining contributions for infrastructure for a development to go ahead He was told it was not normally the case but recalculating the cost of such a complex project could take years.Mrs Bell said that the community council had concerns which had grown in recent years as housing in parts of the estate had been built and families moved in.She said concerns

The investors claim that ldquorenewables and networks are intrinsically dferent businesses with inidual funding needs, growth profiles and strategic priorities. The article goes on to say the combination of renewables and network assets is depriving shareholders of pound billion value because they do not belong together.I find this cynical prioritising of shareholder value over the engineering and ultimately the consumer interests in efficiency, security and cost control deeply upsetting. The strategic priority is to recognise that the integration of generation and network is a real-time absolute and demands engineering discipline. Anything which intervenes to confound this fact can only lead to increased risk and costs to the consumer.This highlights all the problems of establishing a viable secure and efficient public electricity supply when it is being controlled by bankers rather than engineers.The establishment of a National Energy Authority is an urgent priority.Norman McNab, Killearn.NO MORAL SUPERIORITYBOB Ballantynecannot be allowed to get away with his claim that,the father of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and his partner ldquohad been religious, they ldquocould not possibly have carried out the boyrsquos ill treatment and murder. He should try telling that to the many victims of physical and sexual child abuse when in the care of schools or other institutions run by religious orders.The truth is that those who choose to belong to a religion are no better than those of us who do not. Clearly people have every right to choose to believe in a god, or gods, and to try to live their own lives under the rules of their chosen religion. But they have no credibilitythey try to imply, as Mr Ballantyne does, that they are somehow better people than those of us who live in a more rational world.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As such, it is urging people to defer such parties at this time.In a statement issued this evening, Dr Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland#s director of public health science and medical director, said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new COVID iant is much more transmissible.#The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.“We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of COVID-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time.“I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Public Health Scotland has also issued a reminder of the other measures we can all take to continue to keep safe over the festive period:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines. This included strict guidance to employers with staff who can fulfil their duties from home and testing before mixing with people from other houses.These changes come as Orkney recorded seven cases over the past  hours, according to the daily figures published by the Scottish Government. This has brought the county#s total to .On the new restrictions, the First Minister said: “To be blunt,you had staff working from home at the start of the pandemic, please now enable them to do so again.##I#m asking you to do this from now, until the middle of January, when we will review this advice again.#She also said: #Test and Protect is deploying enhanced contact tracing for all cases with the s-gene drop-out that is indicative of Omicron. For these cases, household contacts of close contacts, rather than just the close contacts themselves are being asked to test and isolate.#For non-Omicron cases,you have COVID symptoms you are being urged to book a PCR test and self-isolate until you receive the result. If the result is negative, you can end isolationyou are double vaccinatedit is positive, you must isolate for the full ten days.Ms Sturgeon has also asked everyone to test #regularly and repeatedly# with lateral flow device test.#We are asking everyone to do a lateral flow test before mixing with people from other households — and on every occasion you intend doing so. That means before going to a pub, a restaurant, visiting anybody #s house, or even going shopping.#Concluding, the First Minister said: #If we do all of these things, dficult though I appreciate they are, even with a more transmissible iant, I do really hope we can avoid the need for any further measures.

Greater scrutiny of branch closures must be in place to ensure that people who rely on cash can access it.ldquoWe are calling on banks to pause any programme of branch closures until proposals to protect access to cash are rolled out. The Government must also urgently press ahead with long-promised legislation that guarantees consumers can continue to access cash for as long as it is needed.Ms Hoult has written to banks on UK Financersquos Access To Cash Action Group, warning that the rate of bank branch closures seriously undermines industry efforts to address dwindling cash access.It said whenever a decision to close a bank branch is taken, an independent assessment should be made of the affected communityrsquos cash needs a summary of this assessment should be made public to ensure transparency and accountability and seamless access to the most appropriate type of provision should be put in place to ensure there is no gap in availability for those who need it, particularly the elderly and vulnerable. vw,vw,px, px\"Not everyone can use online or phone banking If banks are unable to meet these commitments, Which  believes they should pause their branch closure programmes until they are in a position to do so, or until legislation to protect access to cash has been implemented.The UK Government committed to legislation to protect access to cash in March .Which  collected bank branch closure data by tracking announcements and contacted banks to confirm the figures. It said when a bank has refused to do this, it included figures from bank announcements and other sources.David Postings, chief executive of UK Finance, said: ldquoEnsuring there is continued access for those who need it, both now and in the future, is something the banking and finance industry has already publicly committed to delivering.ldquoAs part of this, the Access To Cash Action Groupwas established earlier this year and it is chaired by Natalie Ceeney and brings together the firms with the largest branch networks, the Post Office, Link, consumer groups and UK Finance.ldquoThe group will shortly be setting out detailed plans for how the industry will deliver on the commitment to preserve access to cash, including the findings from pilot schemes which have been trialling dferent ways to help people to access cash.ldquoThe work of the CAG has been undertaken at a time when the use of bank branches has continued to fall, with growing numbers of customers choosing to use new technologies to manage their money.ldquoBut technology is not for everyone and the industry absolutely recognises that branches remain an important part of local communities and therefore any decision to close one is never taken lightly.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said banking ldquois actually a vital public service, adding: ldquoAs such, it has a social responsibility which goes well beyond the current prime concern of making huge profits.Here is how branch closures across the UK have added up in  so far, according to Which :January ndash February ndash March ndash April ndash May ndash June ndash July ndash August ndash September ndash October ndash November ndash We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?1638984916000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211208newscovid 19 wed 8th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The Sweeney’s have other fund raisers in mind for the New Year, including a Tractor Run - in memory of their late tractor loving son Alexander.With tears welling up in both parents eyes they recalled how their world was turned upside down after getting the news that little Alexander had an incurable condition, giving him just months to live.In November last year Alexander took a stroke and seizures, and was in an induced coma for  days.Tests were taken and the le shattering news that Alexander had in incurable condition was was given to Lisa and Jason. Alexander, at just three years of age, passed away on July  this year.“We said at the time that we will be trying to raise as much money as possible to give to the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice,” outlined Lisa.“They were absolutely amazing and need all the support they can get.”Both parents agreed that the public are not aware of the work carried out by the staff at NI Hospice.“The Hospice helped us get through a very dficult time. They supported us and gave us respite when we really needed it. In Alexander’s last days the Hospice staff worked very hard. We know we could not have got through without their excellent backing. We say a very special thank you for everything they did. Words cannot really describe just how good their were. We are, and always will be, most grateful to them,” outlined Lisa.Alexander’s condition deteriorated towards the end of June this year - and in the end Hospice staff worked one-to-one making things as comfortable as possible for him.At present the Halax Bank in Bryan Street in the town, where Lisa works, are organising a collection for Hospice.“People have been very kind. We are very grateful to every single person who has donated. All the money raised is going to a very worthy cause,” said Lisa.And special thanks also go to their friends, Mark and Lesley McCaughan, of Follow Coffee in Greenvale Street who organised a Supper Club which raised pound, for the ‘Alexander Tribute Fund’.And the chefs, Phil Tynan and Jason McCartney, along with the staff worked flat out, free to charge, to make the fund raiser a success.There were six courses - and on the night there were  covers !A special menu was put together - The GardenThe Lough  The FarmThe EarthThe Orchardand The Forest .It went down very well with all who participated.  There was also a raffle with local businesses weighing in with their support - Ultimate Fashions, Blossom and Birch, Castle Bar and Grill , Toome Eel Fishery, and Follow Coffee.“Again the support was magnicent.

Pupils have to leave the bathroom to go and ask for them,” she said.“There is a requirement for these products to be available in toilets and that’s what we’re asking for.

In Northern Ireland it’s over %.” No cost has yet been put on the cost of any scheme to provide period products in all schools and public buildings, which Homeless Period Belfast say is a basic human right, with MLAs estimating the total bill for providing products could run over £ million.“Can you really put a cost on health needs,” Ms O’Donnell asked MLAs. “Having a period is not a choice. This is a human rights and equality issue as well as a health issue.”While saying she was in support of a plan to provide products, DUP committee member Diane Dodds MLA stressed it would be “very important” to have a business rationale behind it. “We do not want barriers to education,” she said. “This is incredibly important, but we need to explore the costing issues.”Katie Bryce, from Homeless Period Belfast, said the results of a recent survey of girls carried out by the organisation showed % agreed that period products should be available freely in schools.“Some % told us they had left school early or missed a day because period products were not available,” she told MLAs. “Figures like that show the impact this can have on educational underachievement.“A further % told us they had to ask a teacher for products and % said the lack of availability negatively impacted their attention in class. Almost all, %, said they had just used toilet roll instead.”Also giving evidence to the committee, Grace Boyle, from the Students’ Union at Ulster University, said students had started their own Period Poverty Action Group several years ago, and the uptake of provision had been enormous.“The service we have managed to provide had been very widely used,” she told MLAs. “But we need to extend the service to other locations.“By the time girls reach university age, they are already used to putting their own pads together, but there’s no doubt there’s a real and pressing need for this bill, and we need to make products freely and widely available to hep remove the stigma and embarrassment many still feel.”Northern Ireland remains out on its own in being the only part of the UK not to have a permanent scheme in place to tackle period poverty.If the bill, which is currently passing through the Assembly legislative process, is adopted, it would create a legal right of free access to items such as tampons and sanitary pads.Bill sponsor Mr Catney said: “This is an absolute indictment on our history of mistreatment, discrimination and under representation of women and girls and their issues.”The committee stage of the bill is due to continue until February.Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-Northern Ireland Spend Local card deadline extended for second timeUlster Rugby must clary its position on Kingspan sponsorship, says Baroness HoeyEmma Little-PengellyOpinionUnionist leaders need to get out and smash the stereotypesTop VideosPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligible.Latest EducationNI classroom assistants ‘under pressure’ to plug teaching gapsFlexible school starting age in Northern Ireland could be available from next yearCall for urgent change to address school unorm costNI teachers #in tears# dealing with Covid crisis in schoolsBrain drain blamed on Northern Ireland’s political ideLatestMasks become mandatory in most indoor settings in EnglandNew restrictions to tackle Omicron ‘not being envisaged at the moment’US actor Jussie Smollett convicted of staging attack and lying to policeZookeepers throw surprise Christmas party for pair of ‘jolly’ ottersWest Ham will not fear likes of Barcelona in Europa League – David Moyes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The update report on Wednesday does not go into detail or make suggestions to take forward, but does point towards the possibility of endemic disfavouring in the bike scheme.It states: “Work to date on the draft equality screening indicates the potential dferential impacts on women, those with disabilities, those with dependents and those who are older.“Given the ersity of issues experienced, it also notes the need to further investigate the potential impact on those from dferent racial groups in Belfast, as well as those with disabilities in order to better understand the potential impacts.“This information and health data will be considered to inform future development of the scheme subject to feasibility. Further analysis is also being undertaken into the incorporation of the additional location assessment criteria to ensure clarity of definition and application of assessment.”Alliance Councillor Michael Long said the Sinn Fein call-in had caused a six month delay to the scheme, and stated the report recommendations had not changed since then.He said: “I have concerns about the three or four groups that have been identied as being potentially impacted – that we are not taking account of that now. The reason it was called in seems to be geographical issues rather than anything .”The council officer replied: “We don’t understand the nature of those dferential impacts without further analysis, and when we secure the specics of the site locations.”Sinn Fein Councillor Ronan McLaughlin said: “I am surprised by other councillors’ reaction to this, they seem to think we have spent the past six months almost wasting our time, and this should have been agreed in June.“It was called in for two reasons, community impact, which has proved valid, and for procedural reasons, because it wasn’t equality screened. And what we have seen from this exercise is that people with disabilities, women and old people may be adversely affected by some of the decisions we make.“Certainly I don’t think it is a waste of time for a screening process. I am almost shocked by councillor’s thoughts. The screening will make Belfast Bikes and where they are stationed better for everyone in the city.”Councillors agreed to  new stations in the north at Yorkgate, Shore Road and Antrim Road, Duncrue St Mary’s College Falls, Shankill Road, Springfield Road, and Whiterock Road in the west Lisburn Road, Malone Road and Upper Ormeau Road in the south, and Castlereagh Road, Upper Newtownards Road, Cregagh Road, and Holywood Road in the east.

small degree of immune escape, Sage has said.Read MoreSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-HOW IT COMPARES TO DELTA: Reports of superspreader events around the world, some of which involved Omicron, suggest the danger of airborne transmission of Omicron is greater than with pre-existing iants, such as Delta.As a result, experts at Sage have said “measures to reduce airborne spread such as ventilation, well-fitting masks and distancing or reduced density of people in indoor environments may be even more important”.The likelihood of transmission in hospitals is also “likely to be an even greater risk as a result of Omicron”.Measures will need to be put in place to reduce the risk of healthcare workers becoming infected, while measures in other vulnerable settings such as prisons and care homes should also be considered.Read MoreCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four further deaths and , casesHOW QUICKLY IT CAN INFECT: The generation time for Omicron is not known, but Sage has considered the possibility that it is shorter than Delta, which it said, “would mean that case-based interventions, for example finding and isolating cases through contact tracing, become less effective because people become infectious sooner”.If this is the case, population-based public health measures, such as face coverings and social distancing, will be even more important than measures that pertain only to those who are confirmed as being infected.HOW QUICKLY WE NEED TO ACT: Hospital admissions will continue to increase for a number of weeks after measures to reduce transmission are put in place.“This is due to the lags between measures being introduced, these measures affecting incidence of infections, and then this being reflected in hospitalisations,” said Sage.The faster the growth in infections at the point measures are introduced, the more admissions will increase in the period between action being taken and the number of admissions being affected.Sage estimates that with a doubling rate of three days, once hospitalisations begin to increase at a rate similar to that of cases, there could be a -fold increase in Covid cases in the system before interventions to slow infections are reflected in Covid inpatients.Most ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his

The firm is now being examined as part of an inquiry into how Grenfell Tower came to be coated in flammable materials which contributed to the spread of flames.However, Kingspan said it “played no role in the design of the cladding system on Grenfell Tower” where its product “constituted approximately % of the insulation and was used as a substitute product without Kingspan’s knowledge in a system that was not compliant with the building’s regulations”.Ulster Rugby has repeatedly told the Belfast  that it will not be making any comment in relation to its corporate relationship with Kingspan whilst the Grenfell Tower inquiry is ongoing.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAndrew Moore has made his Christmas Movie Advent Calendar a tradition.Garrett HarganTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Belfast man with a passion for cinema is keeping one of his favourite festive traditions alive and spreading cheer through his Christmas Movie Advent Calendar.Children’s author Andrew Moore works with the NI Science Festival and Belfast International Arts Festival throughout the year.Come December, in the countdown to the big day, he gets into the Christmas spirit by drawing up a list of  Christmas films he loves, and asks a Twitter follower to select a number at random each day.Nine days in and an eclectic mix have made the cut, including It’s a Wonderful Le, Miracle on th Street, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, In Bruges and Trading Places.Andrew explained: “I started doing it in  as a way to ease myself into the Christmas spirit – which is my favourite time of the year.“I just made a list of  Christmas films I love and numbered them at random, then I pop on Twitter and ask those who follow me to pick a number from - and so on as it counts down. Heartwarmingly enough I have people who say the season doesn#t begin till it starts.“One person on Twitter has pretty much reserved picking the film on st December every year now.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It’s a special time of the year for Andrew who said he was lucky to grow up with such generous parents who gave their children “such great memories over the years”.Like most of us, a particular gt stands out: a Super Nintendo he was given in .“These days my favourite part of Christmas is being able to take two weeks off to spend with family and friends eating, drinking and generally relaxing, which definitely includes watching a lot of films and TV,” he said.Everyone has a Christmas film that resonates with them and they come in many guises.Some favour the classics others believe they have to contain Santa to be truly festive certain films are just on the TV schedule every year like Back to the Future and Harry Potter while a shoot-em-up like Die Hard reigns supreme in some households – there is a Christmas Eve party after all… amidst the gunfire and explosions.For Andrew, the best are often those that give a bit of hope, redemption or triumph. He said: “Be it James Stewart at the end of It#s A Wonderful Le running through the streets realising his world hasn#t ended, Scrooge realising the error of his ways in The Muppet Christmas Carol, to even Bruce Willis overcoming the bad guys by the end of Die Hard.“Christmas means so many things to dferent people. It can be as straightforward as believing in Santa on Miracle on th Street to simply surviving it, as embodied in more left field films like Gremlins or Home Alone.“It suits so many styles too, from family friendly to action to comedy to horror, even in the superhero genre with Batman Returns.”Askedany modern films make the shortlist, he says that it is generally the classics, but his partner would loveone year he just did entirely Hallmark and Netflix original films - “not sure I could bring myself to do that mind,” he laughed.However, he’s a firm believer that Christmas films cross all genres and are not always family friendly. “There are definitely some I wouldn#t let my nephews or nieces watch over Christmas, such as Bad Santa, Rare Exports and - as of  minutes ago - tonight#s film Stanley Kubrick#s Eyes Wide Shut.“Definitely some recent ones I#d throw in for future years, like the Happiest Season, which I thought was a lot of fun.”On the day itself there is usually no time for movies, he said, but on Christmas Eve at about .pm or so, he cuts up some big slices of roast ham cooked earlier in the day with some wheaten bread, pours a beer and sticks on The Snowman to see him into Christmas Day.“Not sure why but it#s always felt like a moment of calm before the big day,” Andrew concluded.You can find Andrew at twitter AGRMooreMost ReadNorth Down landowner anger as Stormont department set to list World War Two artillery gun house in his gardenSinn Fein’s John O’Dowd attends Craigavon hospital due to Covid-Northern Ireland Spend Local card deadline extended for second timeUlster Rugby must clary its position on Kingspan sponsorship, says Baroness HoeyEmma Little-PengellyOpinionUnionist leaders need to get out and smash the stereotypesTop VideosPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasPlayFirst Minister and Deputy First encourage people to take up both doses of the Covid- vaccine and the booster dose when eligible.Latest Northern IrelandProtest loyalists are unlikely to be successfully prosecutedActor Adrian Dunbar lines up for event tackling mental health issuesExecutive urges public to take lateral flow tests twice a week coming up to Christmas to combat spread of Omicron iantShared island already exists, Patrick Kielty saysParents at two primary schools vote in support of integrated statusLatestMasks become mandatory in most indoor settings in EnglandNew restrictions to tackle Omicron ‘not being envisaged at the moment’US actor Jussie Smollett convicted of staging attack and lying to policeZookeepers throw surprise Christmas party for pair of ‘jolly’ ottersWest Ham will not fear likes of Barcelona in Europa League – David Moyes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Although this is a new iant, our early understanding gives us confidence that a booster dose of Covid- vaccine will offer good protection against Omicron and Delta infection.”“Our current wave of disease continues to be driven by the Delta iant of Covid-. We know that the public health measures we are so familiar with will break the chains of transmission of Delta, and we are confident they will work on Omicron,” he said.There are now six confirmed cases of the Omicron iant in Ireland. A number of other probable cases are under investigation.— Dr Tony HolohanDecember , Mr Martin, speaking on the Tonight Show on Virgin Media, said that the timeline for providing vaccinations to children – following approval from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee– was currently being worked out.He indicated that a full plan and a timeline from the HSE could be ready within a week.“This creates a new logistical challenge for the HSE in terms of how this gets organised. I do think we should give them the time to come up with a comprehensive plan, announce it in a comprehensive way,” he said.Mr Martin was also asked whether schools were still safe, amid high rates of the virus among young children.“The Government asserted that on foot of public health advice,” he said.“We were told consistently that schools are safe places for children.”“Also we were told that the bulk of transmission was in the community.”“We have to work in accordance with public health, especially in relation to children and schools. It’s not something that I make up or invent in terms of how best to organise schools in the middle of the pandemic.”Earlier, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry told reporters at a briefing that a number of suspect cases are being investigated, but said health officials are under no illusions that more cases will soon be confirmed.HSE chief Paul Reid said that he expects the number of Omicron cases to rise signicantly, with the expectation that it will become the dominant strain of the virus in Ireland.“No reassurance can be taken now at the low levels that we’ve identied here,” he warned.“We’ve seen what’s happening in the UK. We expect it’s only a matter of time before we are looking at signicant numbers of cases phases of Omicron.”Health officials also promised that genome sequencing capacity was now being expanded in Ireland in order to better identy the new iant.A further , cases of Covid- were confirmed in Ireland on Thursday.There are  people in hospitals with the virus, with  patients in intensive care units.Earlier, it was confirmed that the Government had abandoned plans to cut the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemein a bid to help businesses affected by new Covid- restrictions.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said other plans to mody the Covid Restrictions Support Schemewill not go ahead as it will be too “costly” to put in place before Christmas.The Government is to extend the enhanced rates of the EWSS for a further two months, and it will be backdated to the start of December.The existing CRSS will also be extended to the end of January as nightclubs remain closed over the Christmas period.Ministers @Paschald and @mmcgrathtd have today announced plans for enhanced support for businesses who qualy for the EWSS  an extension of the end-date of the CRSS to st Jan .Read more: https:t.co DyzLhcBkS pic YTnPYvVK— Department of FinanceDecember , Mr Donohoe said: “We and the Government absolutely accept that the impact on public health guidance on the hospitality sector in particular has been signicant.“We’re also aware, as we approach into the Christmas period, of the unheightened uncertainty that is there with regard to how businesses will be able to work and how they will be able to employ and who they will be able to employ.”He said further consideration and analysis of the CRSS modication shows it would be “administratively very complex and potentially costly” to have it in place and operational ahead of Christmas.“I recognise in particular that for the hospitality sector, speed is vital in trying to meet their needs as we work our way through a trading period that is so important to so many restaurants and hotels,” Mr Donohoe added.“They need additional support and they need it now and a potential risk developed of our being able to mody the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, but not being able to deal with in time and not being able to have the impact that we wanted to have.“Therefore I have decided, and will be recommending to Government, that we maintain the enhanced EWSS subsidies for a further two months period across December and January.“This is a quicker way of responding to the need of how we support businesses in the medium term.“This scheme and its operation has been the cornerstone of how the Government has helped our employers respond back to the current crisis.“It has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment, and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees.“To date, the overall cost of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme alone is . billion euro.“I propose to extend the CRSS scheme up to the st of January, to allow any businesses which are prohibited from opening to continue to avail of the scheme.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdab--f--dcfcd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdab--f--dcfcd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdab--f--dcfcd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdab--f--dcfcd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, left, and Michael McGrath, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, left, and Michael McGrath, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Mr Donohoe is to introduce the amendments in the Finance Bill in the Seanad next week.The Vintners’ Federation of Irelandwelcomed the decision, saying the extension will keep people in their jobs over the festive season.Chief executive Padraig Cribben said: “The restoration of the EWSS to its full rate backdated to December  is welcome news as the trade approaches Christmas.Welcome restoration of the full EWSS until end Jan  following intensive representations from @VFIpubs and hospitality sectorWhile today#s decision is vital for our struggling members, it remains a short-term solution.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern.

For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

John Hume was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and one of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace process. The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added: The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in. Theyare expected to go on display later next year. Speaking at the Committee meeting yesterday, SDLP councillor Rory Farrell said: This is a fantastic gt from the Humefamily to the people of this city. John and Pat are sadly no longer with us,but their legacy lives. Their legacy ispeace, it’s peaceful change. It’s the power of dialogue over violence and John in particular was widelyrecognised and revered for hiscontribution to peace on this island. Hes the only person in historyto be awarded the three big peace prizes and the Humes family have loaned thosethree prestigious awards to the peopleof this city. So, I think its right andI think its proper that those are awardsare publicly displayed in the Guildhallso locals and visitors alike canappreciate and understandthe magnitude of John and Pat’sachievements.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them. I dont know these people I dont know any of them, but theyve all been so lovely in coming back to me. “Surely to goodness, after all thatof time, the papers would have covered a school like that closing ” If you have any information or photographs relating to Killure School, Drumcoon Road, Aghadowey, get in touch with us via editor@derrypostor give us a call on .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec Email: editor@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry group within the Ulster Farmers Unionhave welcomed the further roll out of a local broadband provider into Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Fibrus is currently developing full-fibre infrastructure in rural parts of Northern Ireland, and as part of the process, has struck up a partnership with the UFU. The company became affinity partners of the UFU, meaning their members are able to avail of special rates for its broadband services. James Graham, Group Manager of the South Derry Londonderry UFU said full-fibre broadband would have a major impact on how farmers in the area live and work. “Having access to effective and efficient connectivity services is now essential to those working in our industry,” he said. “This new network will help boost our mission at UFU to support a vibrant and sustainable farming economy. “Modern farming practices and administrative processes have become increasingly digitalised, so connectivity has quickly become a crucial utility on our farms. “We have secured an excellent deal with Fibrus which is available to all our members, so we hope many of them take up this beneficial opportunity - as I have already.”  INTERVIEW: Cllr McPeake: Broadband is a priority  The Mid Ulster councillor says Project Stratum needs to be carefully managed.  Liam Tunney speaks to local Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake about council pragmatism, his role models and helping St Brigids Mayogall go viral last year.   The live network was launched last week in Magherafelt, and Fibrus Brand and Marketing Manager Joe Diver said rural regions had been living in the digital darkness. “That’s why we are committed to connecting communities and equipping families and rural businesses - whether SMEs or farming businesses - with the tools to thrive in modern times,” he said. “We are already making our way across Northern Ireland, transforming connectivity in these areas and addressing the digital imbalance that exists between urban and rural. “Working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union has helped us to identy ways to support local farms and agri-businesses specically, which we know make up a major portion of rural economies. “We’re delighted to now be live in Mid Ulster and look forward to seeing those who need it most, reap the benefits of our hyperfast broadband services.” For more information on the work of Fibrus and the Ulster Farmers’ Union partnership, visit www.fibrus ufu.

A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Pictures from Derrys Strand Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeWoman in critical condition following four-vehicle road crash overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I, like many other families, cycle with my we and three small children and this space and environment to enjoy that time together safely and without fear of accident or injury is a blessing, said Cllr Lewis.ldquoNewry Mourne and Down Council proudly supports active and healthy communities and this cycle lane connects the local council to Stormont in a collective effort to improve the health and wellbeing of residents through the promotion of cycling and the enjoyment of outdoor leisure.Cllr Lewis also congratulated his Slieve Croob colleague, Cllr Andrew McMurray, who has been proactive in ensuring the district is marked on the map in terms of provision of safe cycle routes.He also revealed that Cllr McMurray has challenged him to a timed lap of the new route when it opens and hopes the event will raise money for a local charity, while the duo have a bit of fun along the way.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the Department for Infrastructure to consider the needs of those who need access to agricultural land that runs adjacent to the new pathway and cycling route, during construction and when it is completed.ldquoLand along this particular route is utilised for barley, potatoes and grazing, with the ground rotated each season which means that the fields are regularly in use throughout the year, he explained.ldquoPolice regularly pull in farmers driving along this stretch of road requesting that they facilitate traffic flow by waiting in a lay-by, allowing the build-up of traffic behind them to pass.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the government department consider how itrsquos going to accommodate agricultural or slow-moving traffic, suggesting that the original lay-by structure in the area needs to be maintained and protected to allow for safe access.He added: ldquoThese issues certainly arenrsquot impediments nor am I seeking to cause an obstruction.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

He and his we, Charlotte, live near Edinburgh and have three sons, Angus, Jack and Hector.His introduction to rowing came only six years ago when he took up skf racing. He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money. The boat is excellent, but we tried to lighten it as much as possible in order to make easier. Even so, we are putting in enough food and water to last a minimum of  days, plus our clothes and sleeping gear.The boat will also carry navigation and safety equipment, plus satellite phones to keep in touch with their loved ones and other competitors.During the voyage, three crew members will be rowing at any time, while the other two are resting, and safety harnesses will be worn at all times.ldquoWersquove trained hard and prepared well and I know that racing two kilometres in a skf race bears no comparison with what lies ahead, but wersquore all looking forward to the race, Clive added.Clive and his team-mates are hoping to raise pound, for the Reverse Rett charity, which supports children with Rett Syndrome, a neurological degenerative disease.Anyone wishing to make a donation is asked to go to visit https:www.justgiving fundraising ross-mckinney.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 12%2C 2001  ","story":"SAINTFIELD ndash Saintfield is in line for a new multi-million pound hotel development which is set to create up to  jobs.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Ann-Marie McGlynnis an experienced runner who as a Veteran Over  showed that age is no barrier in her case.Aoe Kilgallonin . and Nakita Burkein . completed the podium.EDACrsquos interest lay with their own three runners. Leanne Spick having recently completed her first cross-country was keen to try her first K. She is enjoying being part of a club and the support that this garners.She reacted well to the shouts of encouragement and finished sub  minutes, a bit ahead of Janine Murray who recorded . despite a hamstring niggle.While the Seeley Cup is seen as a fast race it is also inclusive with many targeting the distance rather than a specic time. Sam Anderson was glad of the cheers of club mates as she battled to the finish in one hour and seven minutes. Another race ticked off by this consistent attender. Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race. He was probably one of the youngest in the -strong field, having celebrated his th birthday a few days beforehand, so had no expectations and therefore maybe put less pressure on himself.He had a great run in the end, taking one minute and  seconds off his previous road k personal best and completing the course in .. He finished th and was the second Down team member home.Both boys have done their club proud and their parents also deserve medals for acting as support crew on multiple weekends. They will all be glad of a rest before racing resumes in January.Dillon in KGavin Hynds, as a long term member of East Down AC, was delighted when his son, Dillon, decided to follow in his footsteps by signing up to the EDAC junior section.Dillon has been attending sessions since September and gaining confidence each week, so when his school, Our Lady and St Patrick Primary, announced a fundraiser k fun run and walk he felt that he might be fit to take part as a runner.On Saturday morning despite the horrible weather conditions, he set off to the RGU in Downpatrick with Gavin as his sidekick. K is a long way at Dillonrsquos age, but to give him his due he stuck at it and made it to the finish with a bit of encouragement from his dad. Super effort Dillon!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Town manager could help find financial support for businesses  ","story":"A NUMBER of business owners have revealed that it is dficult for them to find out what potential funding opportunities are open to them.The issue was raised at a special event in Downpatrick last week as part of the Northern Ireland Executiversquos initiative to examine the future of high streets in towns and villages across the province.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative met with business owners and elected representatives at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn for a workshop designed to provide them with an opportunity to have their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force initiative is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.During the two-hour event, some from the Downpatrick business community said they find it dficult to access information on what financial support is potentially available to them and they donrsquot know who to turn to for help.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is currently consulting traders in Downpatrick about the potential of appointing a town centre manager while another suggestion tabled at last weekrsquos meeting was the creation of a new business improvement group.In addition, it was also suggested that shoppers should be allowed to park in dedicated loading bays in the town centre on Saturdays when they are not in use.The new Stormont initiative recognises that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions, with people asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.Last weekrsquos event in Downpatrick has been described as ldquointeresting by local councillor Dermot Curran, who said he understood the ldquoconcerns of those in the business community who have no one or no recognised body to help them understand what potential funding opportunities are available to them.He went on: ldquoDiscussions are continuing about a town centre manager but no final decision has been made. In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11360838.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their future is terrying.”During his career, James competed in several athletic categories and won two gold medals for Great Britain at the  New York Paralympics. He denied he had caused a public nuisance. Extinction Rebellion’s occupation of London City Airport was designed to highlight the climate impact of air travel.The most energy-intensive activity an inidual can undertake, no other human activity consumes as much energy in such a short time.Mile for mile, flying is the most climate-damaging way to travel.Extinction Rebellion has a number of cases going through the Crown Courts.James’s was the fourth jury trial, and followed the acquittal in April  of six people for criminal damage to Shell’s London HQ, despite all but one having no defence in law.In July this year, the UK government published its Jet Zero strategy to achieve net zero in the aviation industry by .Air travel is an elite activity.Only a tiny percentage of the global population can afford to fly and they have a disproportionate carbon footprint.Taking a long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than the average person in dozens of countries around the world produces in a whole year.The government has repeatedly been advised by its own Climate Change Committee to limit the growth of aviation in the next  years, starting with a halt to airport expansion.The government’s suggestion, in its Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, that the public can continue to fly since aviation will be carbon neutral by mid-century have been widely ridiculed.The government has recently proposed a reduction in Air Passenger Duty Tax whilst the industry is already estimated to be subsidised by £bn per year.The news comes as the PCSC Bill, which has been widely criticised for seeking to limit the right to protests, s to the House of Lords for amendments.Zoe Blackler, Extinction Rebellion media officerFor more letters, opinion pieces, and News Letter editorials, go to this link:gt www.newsletter news opinion lt——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But they weredisciplined by the chief constable, prior to full understanding of the circumstances, after nationalist uproar at PSNI handling of the Covid breach. The saga fuelled the sense that when republicans get upset about something, the PSNI high command jump.The police ombudsman investigated the complaint against the two officers and sent a file to prosecutors. It is now December, almost a year after the incident. Are prosecutors unable to expedite cases that patently lack merit This incident is not the only example of policing weakness in the face of certain outcries. Feebly, Simon Bryne last December buckled in face of ombudsman criticism of the handling of Black Lives Matter protests that June. Far from apologising, as he did over that episode, the PSNI should have stood firm in how it responded to the calculated breach of social distancing in the second Black Lives Matter gatherings. Is Mr Byrne unaware that people who obey Covid rules need to see that those who deliberately don’t will face consequence It was heartening yesterday to see a string of distinguished policing figures — Mark Lindsay, Jim Gamble, Roy McComb — call for the two officers to be ed to normal duties.We give thanks to such PSNI officers for their service in a delicate community atmosphere, eventheir leaders do not. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Everyone will want to meet with close family and friends and it’s important that people make informed decisions about that, and thatthey are meeting that they do so safely.“We all know the things that we can be doing to make those meetings safer. That is about getting vaccinated and getting our boosters once it’s our turn, and it is about wearing face coverings when we’re meeting indoors, and that it’s well ventillated.“Nobody invites me to parties any more so I shall be spending my time with my close family.”Northern Ireland’s Chief Scientic Advisor, Professor Ian Young, added: “I think it’s really important that we adhere to the guidelines that are in place. If meeting family and friends and socialising is important, as it is to many people, then I think it’s appropriate that we should do that.“If you do see me at any parties over the Christmas period, you’ll notice me staying near the window as much as possible and I can guarantee you I will have taken a lateral flow test beforehand.”Prof McBride, meanwhile, said it is important the rules apply equally to everyone following the furore surrounding reports of multiple reports of Christmas parties at Downing Street while the UK was still under lockdown.Sir Michael said: “I don’t know what went on or didn’t go on, but what I can say is there is no rule for one and dferent rules for everyone . These rules are there for all of us and it is in everyone’s best interests.“This is about controlling the pandemic, a pandemic that has taken a signicant toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods impacted upon.”He added: “It’s particularly important that everyone abides by the rules and follows the regulations. “I think it’s important that the public see that we practice what we preach.”Paul GivanMichelle ONeillNorthern IrelandStormont Executive  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDonaldson repeats threat to bring down StormontDennis Hutchings family lodges formal complaints over lost ‘key evidence’Sinn Fein rising star quit over paymentsFuneral details released for tragic dad Aaron Harkin | ‘you had the biggest, kindest, caring heart’ | ‘a le taken too soon’The ‘gradualism’ of the Northern Ireland Protocol fits the Irish republican strategyMost PopularHow to stay warm without using central heating - including blankets, hot water bottles and teddy beddingMen’s gts for Christmas: great presents for Dads or husbands, including clothing, food, drink, music, gamingThe best gingerbread house kits to buy for Christmas - from houses to bake from scratch to ready-madeMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale now  great Christmas presents under £ - thoughtful gts your loved ones                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We cant wait to take him.\"Ive been following the team for years and it was great to win the prize. Moomins name will be known to everyone around her now.\"The club confirmed Ms Williams - who is also the long-term partner of star striker Thomas Walters - won the prize.The club said: \"The stadium was named after her dog Moomin, who we are reliably informed is treated like a Prince.\"The competition raised vital funds in the quest for the club achieving a FAW Tier  License, with proceeds raised going towards much needed ground improvements such as floodlights.\"Reaction from fans has been positive, although much confusion on the stands last Saturday as to whether were still the Windmill Army or now the Moomin Army.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

John @Spellar calls on the Prime Minister to #BanTrophyHunting imports #PMQs #PMQ # We welcome @BorisJohnson reiterating they will ban hunting trophies. However as the Gvt has been unable to find time for legislation, why not #SupportTheSpellarBill ndash #WinWin for animals pic HwUDanBLrmdash Campaign to Ban Trophy HuntingNovember , The ban is set to apply whether or not a trophy has been obtained from a wild animal or one bred in captivity specically for the purpose of trophy hunting.Breaching the rules could land hunters in prison for up to five years.Campaigners said they would have preferred a total ban on the import of hunting trophies on moral and ethical grounds rather than the Governmentrsquos focus on threatened animals.Dr Jones said: ldquoWersquore very pleased to see the UK finally promising this kind of action ndash doesnrsquot go as far as wersquod like it to go, but itrsquos certainly a very big step in the right direction.ldquoIn this day and age, with bioersity and wildle in crisis and so many species at risk of extinction, we have to move away from this kind of colonial paradigm that the only way to realise value for wildle is to allow relatively wealthy, western hunters to pay to kill it.Mr Goncalves said: ldquoMy ideal would have been a total ban, butwe were to score this like a school paper, I would give it an A-.He said he hoped the bill would initiate international action, with Britain working with other countries to call for an end to trophy hunting world wide.To raise pressure on MPs to enforce the ban, his Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting is sending them a book with photos of British hunters and their spoils.He said: ldquoThere is sometimes a misperception that trophy hunting is what Americans do.ldquoThe reality is that British trophy hunters are among the worldrsquos most notorious elephant hunters.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called a trophy hunting a ldquodisgusting trade and his father, Stanley Johnson, has campaigned extensively in favour of the ban.Original plans for the new law banning hunting trophies were sparked by the shooting of Cecil the Lion in  by American dentist Walter Palmer at a reserve in Zimbabwe.In , the Government consulted on a ban which received overwhelming public support..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Government unveils ban on trophy hunting imports as campaigners denounce delays article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Greater scrutiny of branch closures must be in place to ensure that people who rely on cash can access it.ldquoWe are calling on banks to pause any programme of branch closures until proposals to protect access to cash are rolled out. The Government must also urgently press ahead with long-promised legislation that guarantees consumers can continue to access cash for as long as it is needed.Ms Hoult has written to banks on UK Financersquos Access To Cash Action Group, warning that the rate of bank branch closures seriously undermines industry efforts to address dwindling cash access.It said whenever a decision to close a bank branch is taken, an independent assessment should be made of the affected communityrsquos cash needs a summary of this assessment should be made public to ensure transparency and accountability and seamless access to the most appropriate type of provision should be put in place to ensure there is no gap in availability for those who need it, particularly the elderly and vulnerable..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Not everyone can use online or phone banking If banks are unable to meet these commitments, Which  believes they should pause their branch closure programmes until they are in a position to do so, or until legislation to protect access to cash has been implemented.The UK Government committed to legislation to protect access to cash in March .Which  collected bank branch closure data by tracking announcements and contacted banks to confirm the figures. It said when a bank has refused to do this, it included figures from bank announcements and other sources.David Postings, chief executive of UK Finance, said: ldquoEnsuring there is continued access for those who need it, both now and in the future, is something the banking and finance industry has already publicly committed to delivering.ldquoAs part of this, the Access To Cash Action Groupwas established earlier this year and it is chaired by Natalie Ceeney and brings together the firms with the largest branch networks, the Post Office, Link, consumer groups and UK Finance.ldquoThe group will shortly be setting out detailed plans for how the industry will deliver on the commitment to preserve access to cash, including the findings from pilot schemes which have been trialling dferent ways to help people to access cash.ldquoThe work of the CAG has been undertaken at a time when the use of bank branches has continued to fall, with growing numbers of customers choosing to use new technologies to manage their money.ldquoBut technology is not for everyone and the industry absolutely recognises that branches remain an important part of local communities and therefore any decision to close one is never taken lightly.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said banking ldquois actually a vital public service, adding: ldquoAs such, it has a social responsibility which goes well beyond the current prime concern of making huge profits.Here is how branch closures across the UK have added up in  so far, according to Which :January ndash February ndash March ndash April ndash May ndash June ndash July ndash August ndash September ndash October ndash November ndash .push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Bank branch closures should be paused immediately, says Which  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

a vintage horse-drawn caravan - is to come under the hammer at Wilsons Auctions.By Valerie MartinThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  The rare horse-drawn caravan which is for sale through Wilsons Auctions.The caravan, which was built in the mid to late s, is one of only a handful remaining in the world so this is an extremely unique opportunity for someone to acquire a piece of history at auction.Also known as a Romany Gypsy ledger caravan   do, the asset is property of the estate of the late Mr Jack McNeill and comes from a letime of appreciation.It is thought that the wagon was brought from Wales to Ireland by a Mr Lovell and his we during the First World War. Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm. Bidders will have a full  hours to take part in the auction and place their bids, as the bidding will time out at pm on Friday, December .

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

But one of our key priorities will always be to look after our most vulnerable citizens to ensure that they do not miss out, are protected from this virus, and are not left behind. “I would like to personally offer my thanks to all of the owners of these facilities and their staff for helping us to deliver this programme, and of course to our highly skilled and extremely dedicated vaccination teams, without whom programmes like these simply would not be possible.” For the latest information on the Western Trust’s vaccination programme please visit the Western Trust Vaccination Info page.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbadbbeabc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaeccbedbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?163898491600","title":"covid  wed th december figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
