The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

It’s part of a campaign to highlight the role of the financial sector in the climate emergency, which saw ‘fake oil’ splashed over the Bank of England at the start of the month. A group of women used hammers to crack the windows before staging a sitdown protest at around 7am, and waiting to be arrested. The activists wore patches that read “better broken windows than broken promises”, in reference to the suffragettes acts of civil disobedience to win women the right to vote. In a statement, Extinction Rebellion, pointed to research from the Rainforest Action Network showing that HSBC is Europe’s second-largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays. Last October, HSBC announced a target of net zero carbon emissions across its entire customer base by 2050 at the latest, and is aiming for net zero emissions across its own business by 2030. Extinction Rebellion says it’s not enough: Pizza delivery firm Dominos is still seeing high demand for home deliveries in the lockdown. Dominos reports that trading from 28 December 2020 to 28 March 2021 was strong, including “exceptional trading over the new year period” (when the pandemic meant usual celebrations were cancelled). But while the delivery business was busy, the pizza collection business is still being impacted by lockdown restrictions. Shares have dipped this morning, as the Press Association explains: The bank has taken the biggest hit from the Archegos collapse among its peers, logging a SFr4.4bn charge in the first quarter. It comes after one of its prime brokerage clients Archegos was forced to liquidate almost $20bn (£14bn) in assets last month, in a fire sale that reverberated across global markets. The pre-tax loss, which Credit Suisse executives called “unacceptable”, compares with a SFr1.2bn profit during the same period last year. Credit Suisse said that, excluding Archegos, it would have made a SFr3.6m profit in the first three months of the year. It would have been one of the lender’s best quarterly financial results in at least a decade. The company, which has the UK’s largest automotive manufacturing operation, confirmed to the  it would have a “limited period of non-production” at its plants in Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands and Halewood on Merseyside starting on Monday. It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date. The shutdown underlines the struggles of carmakers across the world to secure a supply of computer chips, also known as semiconductors, amid a global shortage that has affected companies from Microsoft and Sony, the makers of the Xbox and PlayStation games consoles, to the phone manufacturer Samsung and cryptocurrency “miners” who need computer chips to solve puzzles that earn them bitcoin and other digital assets.  A surge in demand for home-drunk coffee during the pandemic has boosted sales at Nestlé. The world’s largest foodmaker says coffee was the largest contributor to its growth in the first quarter of this year, as customers flocked to buy its Nespresso pods, as well as jars of Nescafe instant coffee, and its Starbucks-branded products. Nestlé has also benefitted from the resurgence in home baking under the lockdown, which boosted demand for items like powdered milk, carnation (evaporated milk) and confectionary. Demand for pet food was also strong -- with premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Purina ONE and Felix all selling well.  That’s probably also a pandemic effect. With dog ownership surging since the first lockdowns, all those growing puppies need feeding.... Last December, Nestlé was named one of the world’s top plastic polluters, based on the amount of its packaging found around the world: All those single-use coffee pods are just one part of the wider problem, with far too many ending up in landfill -- prompting a new recycling scheme in the UK. The FTSE 100’s a little higher too, up 15 points at 6910, ahead of this afternoon’s ECB interest rate decision. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The WSJ says CS was struggling to monitor this exposure, as the value of Archegos’s assets changed rapidly. In its outlook statement, Credit Suisse explains: Credit Suisse was one of several prime brokers to Archegos, the family office which took huge leveraged positions on tech and media stocks.  Archegos collapsed when it couldn’t meet margin calls, amid a rush to close positions in which fellow prime brokers Goldman Sachs suffered little damage and Morgan Stanley (who also moved fast) lost over $900m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The collapse of US hedge fund Archegos has dragged Credit Suisse into the red, as the Swiss bank outlines plans to raise more capital.... and Switzerland’s financial regulator, Finma, launches an investigation over the matter. Credit Suisse has reported a pre-tax loss of 757m Swiss francs (£593m) for the first quarter of this year this morning, after suffering a 4.4bn Swiss franc loss from the imposion of Archegos. Thomas Gottstein, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group AG, says the loss is ‘unacceptable’. Gottstein adds that the bank has taken ‘significant steps’ to address this, and its involvement with Lex Greensill’s failed supply chain finance empire: Without Archegos’s collapse, Credit Suisse would have made a pre-tax profit of around 3.6 billion francs, its best in years, thanks to strong investment banking and wealth management work. But following the mult-billion hit, the bank is raising around $2 billion to bolster its capital position, by issuing bonds that will convert to stock. Separately, Switzerland’s financial regulator, Finma, said it opened enforcement proceedings against the bank over how it handled the risks around Archegos. It was already looking into Credit Suisse’s involvement in Greensill Capital. The European Central Bank meets to set monetary policy today, but isn’t expected to make any changes to its stimulus packages. Given the lockdowns in place in many eurozone countries, amid the third wave of Covid-19, the ECB is likely to maintain its ultraloose monetary policy for some time - until vaccinations allow economies to reopen. Vladimir Potapov of VTB Bank explains: European markets are set for a higher open, after a rally on Wall Street last night.  Oil is dipping, though, after a rise in US crude inventories yesterday - and worries that demand will be hit by the pandemic, as cases in India hit a global record.

It will renew its commitment to equality in commemorations, he said. And it would act to ensure the hidden history of former empire communities, and their contribution in the two world wars, is brought to life, he said.But this did not happen, he says. He says there were cases where it deliberately overlooked evidence that might enable the discovery of names of the dead. He says after the first world war in parts of Africa, the Middle East and India, the dead were not treated equally.  He said the graves of up to 54,000 soldiers, who were mostly Indians, east Africans, west Africans, Egyptians and Somalis, were not marked by inidual headstones. Some were only remembered in inscriptions or in registers, and another 116,000 personnel, mostly east Africans and Egyptians, were not named, or even commemorated at all, he says. He says there is no doubt that prejudice played a part in that.Here is my colleague Rajeev Syal’s preview story about this announcement. Q: People need a safe space where ministers and officials can have private conversations. What impact will this have on that? Scholar says he would go back to the public interest point. The public has a right to know about certain things. But the public interest is also served by government business being conducted effectively. He says the Freedom of Information Act sets out to balance those two principles. He says there is a question as to at what point the balance shifts, and the public interest tips in favour of disclosure. Q: Are these stories having a chilling effect? Scholar says it is too early to say. Q: How did the chancellor’s text messages to Cameron come out? Scholar says Rishi Sunak decided to release them. Q: Would he have had to do so under the Freedom of Information Act? Scholar says that is a legal question. He cannot answer that, he says. Q: Ministers are constantly assailed by people giving them advice. It would be odd if they weren’t. Does this mean every person they have contact with is subject to scrutiny. If so, all these contacts would become public interviews. Scholar goes back to the Nolan report of 1995. People have a right to lobby ministers. But it is for government to decide how these approaches are handled appropriately. Q: Do you have rules about WhatsApp? Scholar says Treasury officials have clear rules in their heads about the need to record conversations, and the basis on which decisions were taken. Meg Hillier, the committee chair, says there is a “danger of government by WhatsApp”.In the second stage of the process (see 10.46am), the Treasury thought it was worth considering whether there was an industry-wide solution to supply chain issues that might work.Q: Did David Cameron speak to Michael Gove or the governor of the Bank of England about this? Scholar says he does not know. Roxburgh says he is not aware of any contacts like that. He says Cameron spoke to Scholar, Rishi Sunak and John Glen. Details of those contacts will be released soon. Q: Were people listening in? Scholar says some were minuted conversations, and some were unsolicited calls where the contents were then passed on. Q: How many calls were there in total? Scholar says he and Roxburgh were on one call with Cameron. Scholar took another call. There were also calls to Sunak and Glen.Scholar says business lending in general is not regulated.Scholar stresses that the Greensill plan was not taken forward. Q: Did you know that Greensill was leveraging future income? Would you have had a conversation if you did? Scholar says they were learning about what Greensill was doing. Q: If you knew then what you know about them now, would you have had a conversation with them. Scholar says if he knew everything they found out by the time they took a decision, the answer would have been no. Q: Would you have even taken the phone call if you had known what you know now? Scholar says if they had known what they had to find out, that would have saved a lot of time. But they did not know. He says it is not the job of the Treasury to make assessments of private companies - except where that is relevant to the Treasury’s responsibilities. It considered if Greensill was eligible for its scheme, and rejected it.Q: Did you know of all David Cameron’s contacts with Treasury ministers? Scholar says they knew Cameron was an adviser to the company, because that was mentioned in an original letter from the company. He says Rishi Sunak declared his call with Cameron after it happened. He says he thinks Cameron’s contacts with John Glen, the economic secretary, were recorded around the same time. He says the details will be set out in the Treasury’s response to a freedom of information request.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Con) says that it sounds as if it should have been obvious that Greensill was not eligible. He says he is surprised the Treasury spent so long considering this.Q: Did you take the call from David Cameron because he was a former PM? Scholar says he would always take a call from a minister he has worked with. But he did not have a substantive discussion with Cameron about the scheme, he says. He says he knew Cameron was an adviser to Greensill Capital. He says he was only involved in one call with the company about its application for the corporate finance facility. Otherwise Roxburgh dealt with it, he says. He quotes from the original Nolan report in 1995, which said that everyone has a right to lobby parliament and ministers. It is for institutions to decide how they handle these approaches, the report said. It said institutions should consider the public interest. Scholar says this is what the Treasury did. Scholar says since Cameron left office, he has seen him two or three times, but never to discuss government business. Roxburgh says his job involved talking to a lot of companies. It is normal for him to discuss proposals like this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e76907ce0425a3824fc74f1209904521fe2830d5/0_174_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=630aeb844af1ee9f44db7c5b70b1d080","title":"county championship cricket live day one updates","story":"Durham 51-2 (Lees and Bedingham rebuilding) Essex 67-2 (Cook and Westley out, both to Miles) Worcestershire 77-0 (Mitchell and Libby going like a train) Hampshire 46-1 (Holland and Alsop resisting Gloucestershire) Leicestershire 56-2 (Azad 28 not out a couple of wickets for Gregory) Surrey 68-3 (Underdogs on top Stoneman 29 not out) Lancashire 40-2 (Darren Stevens on the prowl) Glamorgan 77-2 (David Lloyd 59 not out) “Someone said to me yesterday, ‘you must never regret that move’, and I don’t.

I think he did a pretty good job. Jos Buttler has his detractors but he was definitely worth a punt, and performances in county cricket did matter - he selected Sibley on weight of runs and Pope on pure talent. One is a Wisden cricketer of the year for 2021 and the other is the heir to Bell and Gower. His failings were perhaps those that haunted him as a player, an inability to connect with everyone, and a certain insensitivity when dealing with players different to him, thinking especially, as Andy says, of Moeen Ali and YJB Here are Ali’s thoughts on Chris Silverwood’s enhanced role. “It’s a gloriously sunny day here in leafy south Birmingham, where I find myself about to watch the Essex boys take on Warwickshire (well, day one before the  upgrades its representative at this match).

A lot of the work on the Climate Action Bill had already been done by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change, which had spent a lot of time talking to experts and had come up with 74 recommendations, many of which had been incorporated in the Bill, explained Mr Ryan.The new action plan needed to be in place this summer, he said.On the issue of the amount of red tape which farmers faced when changing style of farming, he acknowledged that the regulations needed to change and his colleague Pippa Hackett would deliver a change to regulations and supports to farmers.The Climate Action Bill was saying to the public service that they needed to be prepared to act fast and collaboratively.There would be a need to innovate and experiment and it was up to Ireland to show leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 240,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,800 people have died.Globally, over 140 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 88\u0026nbspdifferent vaccines in clinical development, with another 184 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top four cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople aged 65 to 69 who are at high risk (cohort 5), other people aged 65-69 (cohort 6) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Photograph: Frederic J BrownAFPThe National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) is meeting on Thursday to discuss further key elements of the State’s Covid-19 vaccine programme.Meeting again? Hasn’t there just been a big reorganisation?Yes, last week the HSE redrew the plan after use of the AstraZeneca vaccine was limited to those over 60. This was done following Niac advice, in turn based on a European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessment of clotting events possibly linked to the vaccine. Over-60s have been getting the AstraZeneca this week.Why are we back here again?Shortly afterwards, concerns emerged about similar issues relating to the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine, which is due to play a growing role in Ireland. The company paused deliveries, but following a favourable EMA assessment, which said the benefits outweighed any marginal danger from the vaccine, is set to resume them from Monday.So what’s happening now?All EMA advice is, in turn, parsed by Niac, which advises the Department of Health, with the Minister ultimately deciding. There can be variations, for example, the EMA advice is that AstraZeneca is okay for over-18s, but Niac, in common with many regulators, advised to limit its use locally to the over-60s. That same process is now under way for the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine. But it’s not quite so straightforward this time.Why not?Niac’s AstraZeneca decision was taken on the basis that Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccines would be available, before similar clotting concerns emerged. If the use of both is severely curtailed, it would damage the programme, and make it more reliant on Pfizer, Moderna and other as-yet-unapproved vaccines. There has been audible grumbling in Government that Niac was limiting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine without considering the damage to the rollout of the programme.Some external voices, such as Prof Luke O’Neill, have argued strongly that the advice is too cautious. A similar limit on the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine to that imposed on AstraZenca would mean a significant slowing down of the programme.Where does dose spacing come into it?In the aftermath of the successive blows on AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson last week, the idea emerged of spacing out the doses of Pfizer in order to cover more of the population with a single dose. The pressure to do this was alleviated with the news Pfizer would deliver an extra 545,000 doses from April 26th but, nonetheless, Niac has been asked to examine the merits. There is support in Government for the idea.So what exactly is Niac looking at?Niac is looking at the EMA advice on Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and also at more data on AstraZeneca, which has been requested by the European Commission from the EMA to help deliberations on vaccines. This may have an impact on age constraints, and whether a “broad brush” approach is needed, Niac chairwoman Prof Karina Butler said on Tuesday. They’re also awaiting more data on the impact of spacing in the UK.Crucially, they’ve said they will consider the availability of vaccines and the impact of their advice on the wider programme when making their decisions – a nod, possibly, to Government concerns.How big a role do AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson have in the programme?They comprise more than 1.4 million doses due before June – more than a third of the total for the quarter. Some 605,000 of these are Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, a single-dose vaccine. Some 14,400 doses of this vaccine have arrived in the State, with 26,600 due next week. This shot will likely be important for hitting targets. Regulatory and supply issues have stalled weekly vaccination numbers at about 140,000-160,000, well below the hoped-for pace of 250,000 a week.When will we hear more?Niac says it could be next week. Government is very keen it should be sooner than that. The vaccine taskforce and the HSE then have to figure out how to implement the advice, and make any changes to the programme necessary – something that they may have to do several times as advice, data and research are constantly changing.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn f%C3%A9in s online voter database stored in frankfurt says mcdonald","story":"Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald outside Stormont in Belfast, speaking to media following a loyalist protest in the city against Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.

She said it was being held in Frankfurt.When asked why the information is sorted in Frankfurt she said it was a “technical question” and that it did not matter where the information was held as long as it was in the EU.“People shouldn’t imagine that this is shipped off in a crate to another jurisdiction. The important thing is that it is electrically and technically held and stored safely.

File photograph: Robin MercuriA public sector worker in Italy described as the “king of absentees” by the Italian press is said to have broken the national record by allegedly skipping work for 15 years.Police say the hospital employee continued to be paid a monthly salary that accumulated to a total of €538,000 during the period despite not turning up to work at Pugliese Ciaccio hospital in the Calabrian city of Catanzaro since 2005.Now aged 67, he faces charges of abuse of office, forgery and aggravated extortion. Six managers are also being investigated on suspicion of having played a role in enabling his alleged absenteeism.In an investigation codenamed Part Time, police gathered their evidence in the case from attendance and salary records as well as witness statements from colleagues. In 2005, the man is alleged to have made threats against the hospital director to stop her from filing a disciplinary report over his absenteeism.The director then retired and the man’s absenteeism continued unabated because his attendance was never checked by the director’s successor or the human resources department, police said.In 2016 the Italian government tightened a law against absenteeism after several high-profile police investigations revealed rampant absenteeism across the public sector.In one investigation, police used secret surveillance cameras to ensnare 35 workers at Sanremo’s town hall who had been cheating the time management system for at least two years. The wives of two of the employees were caught using their husband’s staff cards to clock on for them, while other staff members clocked on before going canoeing, shopping or out with friends.In another case, a traffic police officer who lived in the same building he worked in was filmed clocking on in his underwear before going back to bed. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"biden to reveal us climate intent as he hosts summit of global leaders","story":"A coal power plant in Adamsville, Alabama. Photograph: Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsAFP via GettyThe United States is scaling up its climate ambition in tandem with whistle-stop visits to big carbon-emitting countries in an effort to forge greater support globally for collective action.The move in advance of the critical COP26 UN gathering later this year is the polar opposite of the stalling and climate science denialism of the Trump administration and is built on the platform of the US return to the Paris Agreement fold. The backdrop is of failure by its signatories to deliver the agreement’s commitments.President Joe Biden will provide real indication of renewed US intent over coming days and host a virtual summit of global leaders on Thursday and Friday.The scale of the problem is illustrated by an International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast that emissions are set to jump this year the second-biggest annual rise in history as economies pour stimulus cash into fossil fuels in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession.“The leap will be second only to the massive rebound 10 years ago after the financial crisis, and will put climate hopes out of reach unless governments act quickly,” the IEA warned.Surging use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, for electricity is largely driving the rise, especially across Asia but also in the US. Coal’s rebound causes concern because it comes despite plunging prices for renewable energy, which is now cheaper than coal.It coincided with the World Meteorological Organisation confirming that 2020 was one of the warmest years on record.US climate envoy John Kerry has been attempting to persuade global leaders to step up ambition, as current decarbonisation efforts are grossly short of keeping temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees – a key Paris pact target.His ploy is brutally clear: “We need to go where the emissions are to start with,” he said at a recent IEA event. “This is not about politics ... The planet is screaming at us, with the feedback loops that are telling us every single day, ‘Get this done’, not to mention the next generations saying, ‘Hey adults, please be adults, make the decisions we need to make’.”Four degreesEven if the world did everything pledged under the accord, average global temperature would still rise by more than four degrees this century, he has told the world’s worst carbon polluters. His message was: “We have to speed up.”It has yielded success, indicated by participation in the summit by China and Russia in spite of heightened strains ranging across trade, election interference allegations, cyberattacks and human rights abuses.The US and China – collectively responsible for 50 per cent of emissions – agreed last week to co-operate following talks in Shanghai between Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua.Their co-operation is key to the success of global efforts to curb climate change and to achieving a COP26 outcome in Glasgow that gets the Paris pact on the right trajectory and strengthens implementation. The two countries will co-operate “in multilateral processes, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement”.President Vladimir Putin will “outline Russia’s approaches in the context of forging broad international co-operation aimed at overcoming the negative effects of global climate change”, the Kremlin said.The position is less clear with India, the world’s third-biggest emitter behind the US and China, which is under pressure to commit itself to net-zero emissions by 2050.“India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve,” Kerry said during his visit to New Delhi. “You are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy.”India, however, is unlikely to bind itself to net-zero as its energy demand is projected to grow more than that of any other nation over the next 20 years – as its population is set to exceed that of China’s.As COP26 host, the UK government is announcing a racheting up of actions, notably a 78 per cent cut in emissions by 2035 from a 1990 baseline, and including its aviation and shipping emissions – a world first on both counts, and considered the best example of “more in a shorter time frame”.It is sending the right signals, according to Tom Burke of the climate change think tank E3G, but UK delivery on climate actions in the past has been poor. It could prove to be “a Boris blunderbuss” aimed in the wrong direction, he added, when most effort should be concentrated on energy efficiency, wind and solar, battery storage and strengthening grids.Irish inviteIreland was not among countries initially invited to the summit, but subsequently got an invitation in recognition of its scaled-up climate ambition and its efforts to support building of resilience to climate disruption in developing countries, including small island states of the South Pacific.Ireland’s presence on the UN Security Council is likely to be a factor in this. In an address to the council last February, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney highlighted how climate change could undermine international peace and security, “and the importance of Security Council engagement on the matter to achieve a more peaceful world”. Moreover, Biden has declared the climate threat “a national security issue”.Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan will speak on climate adaptation and resilience in a session hosted by US agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack.The summit is the first of a series of global gatherings over coming months where voluntary commitments are expected to be replaced by robust targets. But it will be about a lot more than CO2 cuts. Mobilising public and private sector finance to drive the net-zero transition and to help vulnerable countries cope with climate impacts is set to finally move centre stage.The US has described its efforts as an attempt “to catalyse efforts that keep that 1.5-degree goal within reach”. The ingredients for the right reaction are being lined up, while many countries will choose this week to assert “We’re in”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden expected to recognise massacre of armenians as genocide","story":" US president Joe Biden: A  declaration would not carry any tangible penalties beyond humiliating Turkey and tainting its history with an inevitable comparison to the Holocaust. Photograph: Doug MillsEPAMore than a century after the Ottoman Empire’s killing of an estimated 1.5 million Armenian civilians, President Joe Biden is preparing to declare that the atrocities were an act of genocide, according to officials familiar with the internal debate.The action would signal that the American commitment to human rights outweighs the risk of further fraying the US alliance with Turkey.Mr Biden is expected to announce the symbolic designation on Saturday, the 106th anniversary of the beginning of what historians call a years-long and systematic death march that the predecessors of modern Turkey started during the first World War.He would be the first sitting American president to do so, although Ronald Reagan made a glancing reference to the Armenian genocide in a 1981 written statement about the Holocaust, and both the House and the Senate approved measures in 2019 to make its recognition a formal matter of US foreign policy.At least 29 other countries have taken similar steps – mostly in Europe and the Americas, but also Russia and Syria, Turkey’s political adversaries. A US official with knowledge of the administration’s discussions said Mr Biden had decided to issue the declaration, and others across the government and in foreign embassies said it was widely expected.Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, declined to comment Wednesday except to note that the administration would have “more to say” on the topic on Saturday.Foreign minister Ara Aivazian of Armenia said in an interview on Wednesday that “the recognition by the United States will be a kind of moral beacon to many countries”.“This is not about Armenia and Turkey,” Mr Aivazian said. “This is about our obligation to recognise and condemn the past, present and future genocide.”Erdogan testThe designation and whether Mr Biden would issue it have been seen as an early test of his administration’s dealings with the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The two men have had a somewhat testy relationship in the past, in contrast to the generally warm treatment Mr Erdogan received from President Donald Trump, and the genocide declaration could prompt a backlash from Turkey that risks its cooperation in regional military conflicts or diplomatic efforts.Past American presidents have held back from the declaration for that very reason, and Mr Biden could still change his mind about issuing it.While Turkey agrees that first World War-era fighting between the Muslim Ottomans and Christian Armenians resulted in widespread deaths, its leaders have resolutely rejected that the killing campaign that began in 1915 amounted to genocide.Yet Turkish officials have been bracing for the genocide declaration ever since Mr Biden committed to it during his presidential campaign, and foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu warned earlier this week that it would set back the already strained relationship between the two North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.“Statements that have no legal binding will have no benefit, but they will harm ties,” Mr Cavusoglu said in an interview with the Turkish broadcaster Haberturk. “If the United States wants to worsen ties, the decision is theirs.”The legal definition of genocide was not accepted until 1946, and officials and experts said Mr Biden’s declaration would not carry any tangible penalties beyond humiliating Turkey and tainting its history with an inevitable comparison to the Holocaust.‘Geostrategic hits’The genocide declaration signals that the United States is “willing to take geostrategic hits for our values”, said James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Turkey who served in senior national security posts for the three presidents immediately preceding Mr Biden.Mr Jeffrey, now the Middle East chair at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, said there was little risk that Turkey would turn toward Russia, Iran or other American adversaries to replace its alliances with the West.But, he said, Mr Erdogan could easily try to stymie or delay specific policies to aggravate the Biden administration, particularly in Syria, where Turkey’s tenuous ceasefire with Russia has allowed for already-narrowing humanitarian access, and in the Black Sea, to which American warships must first pass through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles on support missions to Ukraine.Pentagon officials have also noted the value of Turkish forces remaining in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of US and other coalition troops by September 11th Kabul and Ankara have a long-standing relationship that will allow some troops to remain in Afghanistan after the Nato nations leave.Tensions between Turkey and the United States flared in December, when the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Ankara for its purchase and then test of a Russian missile defence system that western officials said could expose Nato’s security networks to Moscow.The sanctions were imposed in the final month of Mr Trump’s presidency, three years after Turkey bought the missile system, and only after Congress required them as part of a military spending bill. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"us pledges to halve emissions by 2030 ahead of climate summit","story":"Steam rises from the Miller coal power plant in Adamsville, Alabama. Photograph:  Andrew Caballero-ReynoldsAFP via Getty ImagesThe Biden administration on Thursday pledged to slash US greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, a new target it hopes will spur other big emitter countries to raise their ambition to combat climate change.The goal, unveiled at the start of a two-day climate summit hosted by Democratic president Joe Biden, comes as the United States seeks to reclaim global leadership in the fight against global warming after former president Donald Trump withdrew the country from international efforts to cut emissions.It also marks an important milestone in Mr Biden’s broader plan to decarbonise the US economy entirely by 2050 – an agenda he says can create millions of good-paying jobs but which many Republicans say they fear will damage the economy.The emissions cuts are expected to come from power plants, automobiles, and other sectors across the economy, but the White House did not set inidual targets for those industries.“It’s an economy-wide goal. There are going to be multiple pathways to get there,” one official told reporters on a conference call describing the plan.Sector-specific goals will be laid out later this year.How the United States intends to reach its climate goals will be crucial to cementing US credibility on global warming, amid international concerns that America’s commitment to a clean energy economy can shift drastically from one administration to the next.Biden’s recently introduced $2 trillion infrastructure plan contains numerous measures that could deliver some of the emissions cuts needed this decade, including a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and moves to electrify the vehicle fleet.But the measures need to be passed by Congress before becoming reality.Mr Biden focused on restoring US climate leadership during his campaign and in the first days of his presidency after Mr Trump, a climate change sceptic, removed the United States from the Paris Agreement on global warming.The new administration has come under heavy pressure from environmental groups, some corporate leaders, the UN secretary general and foreign governments to set a target to cut emissions by at least 50 per cent this decade to encourage other countries to set their own ambitious emissions goals.Mr Biden will announce the number at the start of a climate summit on Thursday that will be attended by leaders from the world’s biggest emitters, including China. World leaders aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, a threshold scientists say can prevent the worst impacts of climate change.One of the administration officials said with the new US target, enhanced commitments from Japan and Canada, and prior targets from the European Union and Britain, countries accounting for more than half the world’s economy were now committed to reductions to achieve the 1.5 degrees goal.“When we close this summit on Friday, we will unmistakably communicate . . . the US is back,” he said. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Covid no longer leading cause of death in England and WalesComment: Why are there so many police shootings in the US?

But perhaps there was never going to be a decision that pleased everyone. Had the jury found the Minnesotan police officer innocent of killing George Floyd last year, the Black Lives Matter mob would have resumed their riots – if they ever stopped. Upon finding Chauvin guilty, meanwhile, the jury was accused of appeasing the very same mob by those on the opposing side of the argument.I have no dog in this fight. It was an awful incident in a foreign land. The shocking killing of George Floyd will have sent shivers down the spine of anyone who saw the footage. The issue I have is with the drama being imported to this country. Violence by American police is an American issue that needs to be resolved by Americans. Protesting in the streets of London about something that happened thousands of miles away, chanting “end police brutality” and “ACAB”, makes little to no sense.It seems we must remind ourselves that America’s race debate is not the same as our race debate. Laws enforcing segregation and other forms of discrimination were still in place in America as late as the 1960s, when the UK was beginning to pass legislation on racial equality. “African Americans” developed their own culture, distinct from that of many people of black ethnicity in the UK. When Afro-Caribbean people from around the Commonwealth were invited to the mother country in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, they by and large integrated into British society and embraced British culture. There hasn’t been the same ide in the UK that we see in the States.Black Lives Matter is a global movement that grew out of the outrage following Floyd’s death. Yet its ideological arguments ignore any differences between nations.By contrast, Tony Sewell’s recent Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report took an evidence-based approach to examining inequalities in the UK, looking at the multiple causes of racial disparities rather than assuming racism. This upset many race-hustlers on the hard-Left of British politics who in their self-flagellation want to proclaim this to be an institutionally racist country. But when we move away from such isive rhetoric and look at the cold, hard facts, we see a nation that has thrived on building a multi-ethnic society with equal opportunities for all.This progress is threatened by importing US debates into the UK, thereby promoting an inaccurate and damaging narrative about race in our country. Divisions are stoked where they needn’t exist and where they often didn’t exist to begin with.Dawn Butler MP’s extraordinary comments in the House of Commons this week only further highlighted this point. In her response to a statement on the Sewell report, she used the term “racial gatekeepers” apparently in reference to the Commission and the equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, and accused them of “gaslightin’ (sic) on a national scale”. This is utterly disgraceful language for an MP to use in Parliament, and the Labour Party would do well to reprimand her for it, especially if they ever intend to reconnect with the common folks of this great nation.I can only speak for myself, but I would assume many ordinary people are fed up with this sort of toxic behaviour.

Six of his bosses face charges of abuse of office for not having investigated the alleged fraud.Mr Scumace was not the only skiver on the hospital’s books. Another 57 employees of the hospital were recently denounced for absenteeism and are under investigation.On the days when they bunked off work, they were allegedly seen playing slot machines, drinking in bars or shopping at the supermarket.In 2015, a town on the Italian Riviera was swept up in a scandal over absenteeism after it emerged that council employees were clocking on for work and then heading to the beach, to the shops or even back to bed.A months-long covert investigation by police found that up to 75 per cent of council employees in San Remo, which is famed for its annual music festival and lies just across the border from Monaco and Nice, failed to show up for work.In one particularly brazen case, a security guard regularly turned up in his underpants, punched his time card and then promptly went back to bed.The guard lived on the premises of Palazzo Bellevue, the council’s main office, enabling him to clock in and then return to his flat.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mi5 joins social media new era openness","story":"Instead, Mr McCallum promised Britain’s domestic intelligence service would “become a more open and connected organisation”.The strategic decision to promote MI5 more widely includes the agency making its “slightly belated debut on social media” on Instagram, the social networking site used to share photographs and videos by its one billion users. Instagram is used by a much younger audience than Facebook, which owns it.Mr McCallum, who was appointed to the job last year at the age of 45, admitted the spy agency’s decision to launch its account on social media may be “routine” for most organisations but “more interesting when you’re in the business of keeping secrets”.It took the agency until 1993 to publicly acknowledge Dame Stella Rimington as its then chief and it remains the case that only the director-general is publicly avowed.In The , Mr McCallum said the agency needed to continue to attract a more erse workforce, calling time on any lingering association intelligence agencies might have with James Bond, the archetypal British spy, who is white, male and Oxbridge-educated.In a reference to his own upbringing, growing up in Glasgow and studying at the local university, Mr McCallum said MI5 would be “stronger” for recruiting people from “all kinds of places”, adding: “Including, crucially, people who have never thought of working somewhere like MI5.“I was once one of those myself growing up in Glasgow, it never crossed my mind that I’d end up working in national security, never mind in a senior role.”He said he wanted to ensure that people were not deterred from joining the agency just because of their “socio-economic background, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, disability, or which part of the country they happen to have been born in”.He did not identify James Bond by name but in reference to the fictional spy’s favourite cocktail, said: “We must get past whatever Martini-drinking stereotypes may be lingering by conveying a bit more of what today’s MI5 is actually like, so that people don’t rule themselves out based on perceived barriers.”Mr McCallum explained that MI5 need not see it as a contradiction in its requirement to be more open while running covert intelligence operations out of necessity.“But the other half of the dilemma is that MI5’s ability to keep the country safe and resilient also depends on our reaching out to others who can help us, and whom we in turn can help.”“We owe it to the public to be constantly striving to learn and improve and in our fast-moving world, with technology advancing at incredible speed, it would be dangerous vanity to imagine MI5 can build all the capabilities it needs inside its own bubble.”The choice of Instagram may raise eyebrows over its ownership by Facebook. As recently as this week, Facebook was condemned by Priti Patel, the Home Secretary with oversight of MI5, for new encryption measures which she said would make it harder for law enforcement agencies to catch paedophiles.MI5 has also frequently criticised social media and Mr McCallum recognised that.In his  article, he alluded to the need for tech companies to do more to “combat damaging State-backed disinformation, and to ensure that terrorists cannot use their platforms to plot or encourage terrorist acts”.But he also praised social media firms for their ability to keep people in touch, all the more crucial during the pandemic.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pass first time wait 8 months driving test ultimatum piling","story":"Learner drivers have reported facing waits of eight months when booking tests and those who fail now face an average wait of 17 weeks to get a new slot.The backlog has prompted the DVSA to warn learners to only attempt their test when they are “completely ready to pass”.Learners are now complaining of feeling added pressure to pass, knowing failure could mean they must wait months to retake their test.Jade Bone, 24, is taking a test in Southampton on Thursday and is concerned at the consequences of not passing.“It’s going to be so long before I’m able to get another test if this one doesn’t go to plan,” she said. “That’s quite frustrating and a scary prospect, especially because it’s an expensive thing to do, having lessons.”Jack Hayes, 25, an AA Driving School pupil who is taking a test in Cardiff on Thursday, admitted he “really panicked” when it was announced that lessons would only resume last week.He said: “I booked (the test) back in October thinking there was plenty of time to learn before then.“I feel lucky to be one of the first people given the chance to take it, but I’ve had much less time to practise and prepare with my instructor.“There is also more pressure to actually pass than normal because the waiting list is so long before I can try to retake it, and more money would have to be spent on lessons to stay test-ready.”Only 46 per cent of tests in the year to March 2020 were passed, leading the DVSA to caution candidates that they should be “properly prepared”.The most common reasons for failing include not looking properly at a junction (22  per cent), not using mirrors correctly when changing lane or direction (17 per cent), and not moving off safely (8 per cent).Mark Winn, the DVSA chief driving examiner, said: “Learners should only take their driving test if they are completely ready to pass, and feel they’ve had sufficient practice driving on a variety of roads and in different conditions.“Thousands of people fail their test every year because of common errors which are potentially dangerous and avoidable.”Tests can be rescheduled free of charge if learners feel they need more time to prepare.Recent analysis found that the number of young people holding a driving licence numbers has fallen to the lowest level since current records began.

The average for a person using the calculator was 13.7 tonnes a year. More than 20 per cent of respondents spend nothing on clothing in a given month, and 10 per cent have solar panels. People who live there have a low carbon footprint across all areas of life, including travel and consumption, which could be linked to the rural lifestyle in the sparsely-populated area. It is full of wildlife, including seals and bottlenose dolphins.Dr Chris West at the Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York, said: The carbon calculator analysis showed people’s desire for a lower carbon future. Meeting our climate targets will require a combination of small and big changes, such as maintaining a reduction in international travel, which is needed to bring down personal footprints. “Changing consumer behaviours are a very important component of moving towards a low-carbon future, but these must also be complemented by a rapid transition towards renewable energy and a circular economy. The scientists also worked out the top five towns cities with a population of more than 250,000 which had the lowest carbon footprints.   Exeter, with 11.6 CO2e, was the best-scoring town or city, because more than 25 per cent of respondents sourced food locally, and 12 per cent had solar panels“Travel is another important area for carbon savings and as we come out of lockdown, making deliberate decisions to walk, cycle and safely use public transport are small choices that make a big difference. “In this critical year for environmental action, it’s vital that people also use their voices to ask businesses and governme nt to commit to the scale of transformation needed to tackle climate change and limit warming to 1.5°C.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeons vaccine embarrassment highlights serious strategic","story":"Not that it is likely to make much of a difference to the result of the Scottish Parliament elections next month, but Nicola Sturgeon finds herself in a bit of a quandary.An online hustings event organised by NUS Scotland became the talk of Twitter as videos of a very rattled first minister were gleefully shared. What brought her to the point where she seemed keen to deliver a Glasgow kiss to her Conservative opponent, Douglas Ross? The SNP have been put on the defensive for their insistence that an independent Scotland, as a fully-fledged member of the EU, would have chosen to abandon the European Medicines Agency and the EU approval and procurement process for the Covid vaccine, and would instead have joined the UK’s rather more successful efforts. This, of course, is untrue. We know this not just because not a single existing EU member exploited the rules to go it alone, and not just because Scotland, having just achieved EU membership, would be vanishingly unlikely to side with the rest of the UK it had just abandoned in favour of its newfound allies on the continent.No, we know the true SNP position because they told us so. In the wake of the government’s decision to forego the services of the European Medicines Agency and pursue its own approval system for the covid vaccine, the SNP health spokesperson in the Commons, Philippa Whitford, said: “The UK is losing the European Medicines Agency – one of the great advantages was working together to have a single licensing system that licensed new drugs right across Europe.”That seems a pretty straightforward and honest statement about the SNP’s approach to the EMA. But last night Sturgeon argued that, since it was at least legally possible for inidual EU members to have pursued their own path, nothing would have stopped Scotland doing the same. And she is right, of course. But that is hardly the point. The point is, would they have chosen to?Why is it that the first minister now refutes what her health spokesperson said? Was Whitford’s assertion that a single system to licence drugs across Europe was one of the EMA’s “great advantages” wrong? Was she reprimanded at the time for saying it? Did Sturgeon herself rush to the media to disown Whitford’s comments and to demand that she be removed from her front bench position?Of course, had Britain’s approach to securing the vaccine proved to be the disaster that the SNP – and every other opposition party – predicted, Sturgeon would not have been put on the defensive. She could have smugly (but with more sorrow than anger, obviously) regretted the vaccine nationalism of the UK government and offered future, closer co-operation with the EU as an incentive to vote SNP in May. That’s politics and few other party leaders would have resisted the temptation to take advantage of such calamitous consequences arising from an unforced error.Instead, with the UK’s (and therefore Scotland’s) vaccine rollout programme soaring ahead of the EU’s, the first minister doubled down and asked her audience to believe that she was always on TeamUK’s side anyway – what on earth would lead us to believe otherwise?The SNP are not the only party to regret their opposition to Britain’s withdrawal from the EMA. But for them it’s a more serious strategic issue than the one that confronts UK parties. Sturgeon has pinned her entire political career on attracting those who voted No in 2014 and Remain in 2016 to her cause. She is beloved in parts of the London-based media because she has given the impression that she is, at heart, a fully signed-up advocate of the European project. Unfortunately for her fanbase, this is far from the case. Her party spent more money and resources on a single parliamentary by-election in Shetland in 2019 than it did campaigning for a Remain vote in 2016. SNP campaigners for Remain were notable only by their absence, for they knew that a Leave vote across the whole UK would suit their short-term political purposes rather nicely, so long as a majority of Scots voted to remain. Just as Sturgeon only discovered her feminist credentials after she replaced Alex Salmond as first minister in 2014, so she has only found an enthusiasm for the EU since June 2016. Her party opposed Britain’s leaving the EMA because it fitted nicely into the “evil Tories abandoning nice, progressive Europe and taking Scotland with them” narrative. And when that narrative turned out to be wholly false, when it was proved that ministers’ decision to pursue an independent vaccine approval process was the right one, Sturgeon found herself either having to defend the indefensible (the position taken by Whitford in the Commons) or deny that such had ever been her party’s policy in the first place.Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, is clearly getting under her skin with his constant attacks on her, while the new Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, seems to be having a good campaign by ostentatiously remaining above the fray and condescendingly criticising both Sturgeon and Ross for being a bad example to children – a comment that further irritated Sturgeon. It emerged today that the first minister, usually so assured in her media performances, has opted out of appearing in person on a BBC Question Time Holyrood election special, while every other party leader will be present. This campaign is proving much tougher for her than most expected, even though she remains virtually guaranteed to still be in her job come May 7.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church england should stop unconditionally celebrating slave","story":"It comes days after a Panorama investigation reported claims that UKME church staff subjected to racist abuse are forced to sign NDAs to buy their silence”.The report sets out almost 50 actions for the Church to implement. These include establishing new, salaried “racial justice officers\u0027\u0027 in all 42 dioceses, and introducing a “racial justice Sunday\u0027\u0027 once a year. It calls for at least one black and UKME candidate on every job shortlist and an aim of 15 per cent of General Synod, the Church’s legislative body, and all local church councils to have black and UKME representatives by 2030.On slavery, the taskforce drew a line on where the Church should stand regarding potentially offensive monuments and criticised it for taking “little action” so far. “The Church of England has taken little action in addressing the historic slave trade and its legacy since it made an apology at General Synod in 2006 for its involvement in the trade. “Regarding monuments and the built environment, deciding what to do with contested heritage is not easy. The taskforce called for a “healthy revision of memory and history in a way that will provide scope for education and formation”.“Decades of inaction carry consequences and this inaction must be owned by the whole Church,” it said.“A failure to act now will be seen as another indication, potentially a last straw for many, that the Church is not serious about racial sin.”The conclusions come on the same day that the Board of Deputies (BoD) published its own report on racial inclusivity in the Jewish community, which aimed to “to learn more about the experiences of Black Jews, Jews of Colour and Sephardi, Mizrahi and Yemenite Jews... and make recommendations for how our community can do better”. The BoD made similar recommendations to the Church, saying that organisations involved in rabbinic training should encourage under-represented ethnic groups to apply for communal roles, and that Jewish schools should ensure that their secular curriculum engages with black history, slavery and the legacy of colonialism.It also called for communal venues to conduct bag searches for all visitors so as not to stigmatise people who look different, without compromising on security. The Church of England’s report follows comments made by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, in February 2020 in which he said the Church remained ”deeply institutionally racist” in an address to General Synod.Just months later, following the murder of George Floyd, the Archbishop said that statues in Canterbury Cathedral are also going to be looked at very carefully to see if they should be there.He added that some will have to come down but that it is not his decision and that monuments would be put in context.The Cathedral later confirmed that all of its items are under review to ensure that any connected with slavery, colonialism or contentious figures from other historic periods are displayed with clear contextual information to avoid “any sense of aggrandisement”.The number of clergy who identify as part of a UK minority ethnic background has historically been low. In the Church of England, one in 25 serving clergy come from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.Of the 42 diocesan bishops across the country, the only one from a BAME background is Guli Francis-Dehqani, the Bishop of Chelmsford. Archbishop Welby, and the Archbishop of York, the Most Rev Stephen Cottrell, said they welcomed the report and would implement some of its recommendations immediately. This includes: working with General Synod to encourage it to co-opt 10 UKME candidates and inviting UKME clergy observers to attend House of Bishops as participant observers for three-year periods until there are six bishops from ethnic minorities able to sit as members of the House.“Racism is a sin,” they said. “There is no place for it in the world and we are determined to make sure there is no room for it in the Church.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid reaches everest base camp climbers infected","story":"Nepal has reported its first cases of Covid-19 among climbers trying to conquer Everest, only weeks after the world\u0027s highest mountain reopened with strict public health precautions.Several climbers have tested positive for coronavirus infection in the capital, Kathmandu, after being flown from the mountain\u0027s base camp, the New York Times reported.The infections could be a blow for hopes of a revival to Nepal\u0027s lucrative mountain tourism industry, after it was devastated by lockdowns in 2020.Climbers were welcomed back last month after local officials said they would institute a strict regime of testing and social distancing for those attempting the 29,032 ft peak.Yet mountaineering blogs have reported some expeditions are disregarding the rules, with climbers failing to wear masks or keep their distances while at base camp waiting to begin their ascents.Prativa Pandey, medical director at the CIWEC Hospital which has identified the infections said officials at base camp were trying to stop climbers from mingling with one another.“We are taking it up with the health ministry to see what we can do for the safety of climbers and staff up there,” Dr Pandey told the paper.Climbers have had to show negative test results on arrival and quarantine themselves. They have also reportedly had to take on extra insurance this year.“We have no other options,” Rudra Singh Tamang, the head of Nepal’s tourism department, said earlier this month “We need to save the mountaineering economy.”The first victim was thought to be suffering from altitude sickness last week when they were air lifted from base camp back to Kathmandu. But testing showed they were infected by coronavirus.As in neighbouring India, Nepal had hoped it had seen off the worst of the pandemic and cases had fallen sharply from a peak last autumn.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeMarcus Rashford has called on ministers to guarantee free school meals continue over the summer holidays. The footballer, who forced Downing Street to u-turn on the issue last year, paved the way for a fresh battle over holiday hunger. Mr Rashford, who relied on free school meals as a child, said help in the summer would have made a “massive, massive dference” to his family. Vouchers were offered during lockdown school closures but ministers resisted calls to continue the £-a-week coupons last summer until Mr Rashford pressured them into a u-turn. The footballer also shamed the Government into offering support during the holidays in November through a Covid winter grant scheme given to councils. The scheme, renamed the Covid Local Support Grant, has now been extended until June  to help poorer families with food and bills outside of term time. The Government’s holiday activities and food programme was also boosted to cover Easter, summer and Christmas breaks this year.But Labour has warned that neither scheme guarantees free school meals for all needy families.More than , children have become eligible for free lunches since the first lockdown, taking the total to . million in October.The Manchester United star spoke of how his mum Melanie struggled during the holidays as he launched a new budget cooking campaign.Asked by The Mirror about free school meals, the top striker said: “I definitely think it needs to be extended and the reason why I say that is, I’m just going back to what it was like for me in the summers. “It’s much more dficult for my mum to keep on top of. Obviously in my household there were four children so as a single parent it was obviously tough for her. “But when we were all in school or in high school, she can rest a little bit because she knows that we’re having a meal there, and then potentially she only has to worry about one meal, which is dinner time. “So having free school meals throughout summer holidays for me would have made a massive, massive dference. “And I feel like what’s happened this year, like the pandemic, it’s affected everyone in dferent ways. “I just don’t see there being anything wrong with extending free school meals, like it’s going to do a lot more good than bad so I definitely think that that should happen.” Children’s Commissioner Rachel de Souza has also called for the scheme to be extended into the summer holidays.  Shadow Childrenaposs Minister Tulip Siddiq said: “Free school meals have been a leline for so many children in this pandemic. “Despite being shamed into action, the Government is still not guaranteeing free school meals over summer. In fact, Ministers’ are passing the buck onto local authorities and their guidance suggests children are provided with food support over just half of the summer holiday. “This simply isn’t good enough and could lead to a postcode lottery in food support.” A Government spokesperson said: “Our expanded Holiday Activities and Food programme, which provides healthy food and enriching activities to disadvantaged children, will run this summer in every local authority in England.Wider support is available including our increased Healthy Start scheme payments and we will continue to explore further options.” Mr Rashford is launching “Full Time: Get Cooking with Marcus and Tom” on Sunday alongside Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge. The duo will do weekly cooking tutorials on social media with celebrity pals like Fearne Cotton and Joe Wicks, using cheap and easy recipes, such as Mr Rashford’s favourite spaghetti bolognese.

The top Tory welcomed the direct access the private sector had to ministers and Whitehall decision makers - despite it prompting allegations of cronyism. And he admitted he was contacted all the time by business people and constituents on his phone, despite holding one of the most sensitive portfolios. Labour has accused the Tories of operating government by Whatsapp with only those with links to senior ministers able to get access.Whitehall’s top civil servant is said to be concerned about how easily the PM can be contacted by text by lobbyists, MPs and business people. But Mr Johnson is reported to have rejected Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s advice to change his mobile phone number, which he has had for more than a decade. The PM has a reputation for listening to the last person he has spoken to, leading to fears that he could be vulnerable to changing or adopting policy. Mr Kwarteng told Sky News: I think that in the real world, in reality, people are contacting ministers, contacting MPs, all the time. Business people are contacting MPs all the time, constituents also contact me on my phone. I think that in a modern democracy itaposs very good that people actually can have direct access to ministers and people who are taking responsibility.  It came as Mr Johnsonaposs ex-comms chief Lee Cain warned that without more working-class figures at the top of Government, ministers would be ever more baffled and out of touch with the electorate. Mr Kwarteng acknowledged there were issues around the Greensill Capital controversy, adding that while there is high standards in public le we can always try and make an improvement. He told LBC: I donapost think it is a drip-drip of sleaze. Clearly, we need to have very, very high standards in public le and I think there were issues around Greensill.

Lucy Stevens, , and Glen Carloss, , bonded over their love of American cars on their first date and even spoke about a shared dream of converting a big bus. Just a few months later they shipped the ft x ft yellow bus from New York to Southampton. It still contained kidsapos toys, discarded school jumpers and sick notes, and they spent nearly a year converting it into a mobile home. Out came the seats and in went heating, a cinema room, a bathroom, a fireplace and a king size bed - but crucially the iconic yellow exterior remains untouched. Videos show their entire process - and the months of blood, sweat and tears that went into the transformation. Would you live in a bus  Share your thoughts in the comments below... Lucy, from Addlestone, Surrey, said: We both shared the same dream of owning a big vehicle to do a road trip for a year or longer. Iaposve always be obsessed with Grand Designs so to achieve something like that, to totally transform something into a liveable home for someone, itaposs mad. We worked so hard on it, itaposs been blood, sweat and tears just because weaposd never taken on anything like that before.  How we achieved the look we wanted to achieve, Iaposm really proud of it. Lucy, a nanny, went on her first date to a rooftop bar in Southbank, London, with tattoo artist Glen in July of , and they quickly discovered they had a lot in common. She said: I told him about my dream of having an American school bus. Glen already had a passion for American cars.  It was absolutely mental, I thought he was joking - we both had the same dream! So, a few months after that first date we started looking into getting one. They found a company who helped ship the iconic buses from the States, and after one look at their yard, the pair paid £, to get their very own in November .  The bus arrived in Southampton four months later in its original condition - with pupilsapos names scribbled on seats and toys, hair bands, and handwritten sick notes strewn inside. Lucy said: It was mind-blowing to see it in person and to think about its previous use, and what we were about to turn it into. And it was huge, itaposs so much more daunting in real le but I absolutely loved it, I couldnapost actually believe I owned it.  The couple got to work with a full renovation - tearing out the seats and flooring before installing electrics, plumbing and heating and partitioning off the bathroom and bedroom. They spent another £, turning the old bus into a liveable space - the only one like it in the UK, they said. They added a king-sized bed, sofa bed, dining area, compostable toilet, indoor shower, fridge, hob, oven, work desk and garage space for outdoor equipment. The transformed vehicle also boasts a cinema room with a projector, as well as a a king-size bed, shower and electric fireplace.

Two youths, who were both  at the time, claimed they did not notice the two and four-year-old children in the back of the car when they stole it with its engine running from Selly Park area of Birmingham. One of the boys told Birmingham Magistratesapos Court how he crashed into two other cars at high speed, before being arrested by armed police. Although the older child was uninjured in the crash, the two-year-old suffered a cut to his mouth and a bruised shoulder caused by the straps of his car seat. The driver, who is still , claimed he took the vehicle to settle a £ drug debt, after mistaking the dad for a delivery driver. He insisted he did not realise the siblings had been strapped into the rear of the Nissan Note until police arrested him on suspicion of kidnap. But District Judge Shamim Qureshi accepted the evidence of the boysapos father, who told the court he shouted to alert the youths to the fact his sons were inside the vehicle minutes before the crash on Birminghamaposs busy A Bristol Road. Finding both defendants guilty of two counts of kidnap, Judge Qureshi said: The only issue in this case is whether the defendants took the children without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Their defence in this case is that they were unaware that the two children were in the car. Ruling that the younger youth had decided to steal the Nissan and the other boy went along with the theft, the judge said common sense meant the children would not have remained quiet during the entire journey. Both defendants admitted aggravated vehicle taking, incorporating dangerous driving, at a previous hearing, but had denied kidnap. The court heard the childrenaposs father was left crying hysterically in the street after his vehicle was stolen on Saturday, February . Giving evidence as his mother watched from the public gallery, the boy who drove the car told the court he was equipped with bolt cutters and looking for a bicycle to steal when he saw the Nissan with its engine running. Claiming his intention was to sell the car to pay off a debt, the teenager said he crashed after being pursued by a police van and seeing oncoming police cars.

How has the pandemic changed the way we grieve  Itaposs unlikely weaposll know the full effects of the past yearaposs events on bereavement, but it has certainly had an impact.

Teacher Sarah Daniels told Daily Mail : As I was looking at the shelves I noticed a tall dark-haired lady further down the aisle and thought to myself ‘I recognise that face’.Mrs Daniels said that at one point, Charlotte sat on the floor and was told by her mother, dressed casually in jeans, low-heeled boots and a jacket: Get up, poppet. George then askedthey could buy some dinosaur slime – a popular school playground fad in Britain – but Mrs Daniels said she didn’t register a response from the Prince’s mother.  She added that when she left The Range a fleet of Range Rovers were parked outside. Mrs Daniels presumed they had transported the royals and their police protection officers to the store.Mondayaposs stationary shopping trip came two days after Kate joined other members of the royal family to say their final goodbyes to Prince Philip at his funeral over the weekend.Kate looked emotional as she sat at her husband Prince Williamaposs side for the service in St Georgeaposs Chapel.

Landlords Sarah and Andy House were left out of pocket after the scammers targeted the Kings Arms in Elham, Kent, just days after pubs were allowed to reopen their beer gardens.Like other publicans they had been shut for months because of the coronavirus pandemic, until April  where they were able to serve food and drink to punters outside. The couple confessed it had been frantic coming up with a new way of operating and were suddenly liable for full rent payments, reports Kent Live.The challenge didnapost get any easier when a table of four left with without paying a penny of their bill on their first Saturday after reopening.Are you a pub landlord who has suffered an increase in people fleeing without paying since reopening  Email webnews@mirror Sarah was so incensed she took to Facebook to call them out.Her post read: Thank you to the table of four, booked in under the name of Josh, who took up a reserved table that we turned customers away from as standing room only. You were  minutes late, keeping the kitchen staff on, you received excellent service, food and drinks, however we will put your leaving very quickly before settling your £ bill down as an oversight, because we are decent people working hard to earn a living, oh and you left in such a hurry you might want to come back and pick your cigarettes up. The post sparked a deluge of support, with people calling the behaviour utterly disgusting to good hard working good people after a dficult year due to the lockdown.  To make matters worse, the table in question were not the only customers to walk away that week without paying. This meant Sarah and Andy were forced to keep peopleaposs bank cards as deposits when they take their table. Liam Jenner, a -year-old who lives in nearby Folkestone and used to work with Sarah at the council, spotted the post and decided to act. He went straight down to the pub and discreetly left £ in an envelope behind the bar. KentLive tracked Liam down after getting his details from Sarah.He said: Sarah used to be my manager at the council a few years back so I’ve known her for a while and often travel to the pub to help her out by buying meals and drinks. I just thought it was very unfair that after such a struggle for pubs during the last year or so with COVID and lockdown that people could do such a thing to struggling businesses. So I thought her business could probably do with the money a lot more than I needed it right now.

The -year-old, from Newlyn, photographed the ins European lobster, Latin name Homarus gammarus, before letting it go as it was too small to take home. Blue lobsters get this colour because of a genetic abnormality which causes an over-production of the protein crustacyanin.

Tom said: With every pot you never know what is going to be inside, and Iaposve certainly never seen one that colour before. This is only my second fishing season so I think Iaposve been very lucky. I measured it and it was undersized so there was never any thought of keeping it. If it had been bigger, I would have taken it to the National Hatchery.  I sent them some photos of the lobster and they told me it is one in two million so that is quite special. A spokesman for National Lobster Hatchery in Padstow, Cornwall, said: It is a pretty rare colour morph to come across, about one in two million chance, so we were amazed when Tom sent us the photo of it.

Little Lottie Batchelor, who has just turned one, shocked her parents Emily, , and Matthew, , when she was born with thick black hair that grew to  inches in a year.Her mum said she didnapost suffer a heartburn, which is what many would think could be the cause for her baby having so much hair.But she did speak of how she is a miracle baby, as she and Matthew had tried to have a child but had eight miscarriages. They were told they werenapost going to be able to conceive naturally, but then they miraculously fell pregnant with Lottie. Mum Emily has to use an abundance of hair products to keep Lottieaposs locks tamed - including conditioner, anti frizz serum, detangler, curl serum, and curl spray. The full time mum also has to style Lottieaposs hair every morning - adding an extra  minutes onto her morning routine. Now Lottieaposs hair is almost the sameas her six-year-old sisteraposs Evie - with many thinking the one-year-old is a lot older than she actually is. Mum Emily explained: When she was born, I was surprised by how dark her hair was and how much of it there was - I wasnapost expecting it at all.  Her hair was the first thing people would notice when they met her people were always commenting on her hair saying how lucky she was to have so much. Sheaposs never lost any - itaposs just got thicker and thicker. Now, her hair goes half way down her back when itaposs wet and by the time sheaposs two, I think itaposll be the sameas Evieaposs. People are shocked when I say that Lottie is only -months-old - most people think sheaposs at least two! I have to use conditioner because it gets so frizzy and it takes longer to blow dry her hair than my eldest. It takes about half an hour to dry and  minutes to style in the morning I have to put her fringe up everyday to get it out of the way and I make sure to brush it through.  If I donapost take the time to do it in the morning, itaposll be matted by the end of the day. Itaposs very time consuming - she has better hair products and more than me! Despite Evie being born with dark hair, parents Emily and Matthew, who works as a builder, were not expecting the amount of hair little Lottie was born with. Emily added: Evie was born with dark hair but it was nothing like Lottieaposs so we werenapost expecting it at all.  I had dark hair when I was born and so did my husband but again, it was nothing like Lottieaposs. Sheaposs very lucky to have it and I wish that I had her hair!

Epstein abused underage girls at the house, which was adorned with pictures of naked girls and stocked with sex toys. Developer Todd Michael Glaser, who bought it for £.million, sent in a digger to ensure no trace was left. Estate agent Lawrence Moens said: “I only got involved in the sale to ensure it would be wiped off the map.”  One neighbour near the waterside property in Palm Beach, Florida, said: “Good riddance.That sick b****** abused dozens of girls in that home.Thank God it’s gone.” Remnants of Epstein’s grotesque lestyle could be seen in the debris as the Mirror visited the site. It was here that victims said his alleged “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell, a pal of the prince, would help recruit girls and schedule teenagers to give Epstein massages. Maxwell was held by the FBI last year but denies any involvement in grooming minors for her late ex Epstein. Former butler Juan Alessi swore on oath in a  criminal probe that he set up massage tables for Andrew, , every day as the royal “spent weeks with us” at the house. He recalled seeing naked girls by the pool during Andrew’s stay but said they dressed before entering the house.

The Sussexes walked away from their senior royal roles in March last year in favour of a new le in LA with their son, Archie. This, along with the Queen sacking Prince Andrew over his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, left The Firm without three working royals - with Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex stepping up to help out. Prince Charles is working out the logistics of how things will look going forward, and has the job of carving up future engagements, projects and royal tours. As a way of supporting the Queen, the family have scheduled a meeting to sort out future business of the monarchy and design tailor made roles for each of the seven senior members of The Firm. It will include collaboration and support for one another from the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne and the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Despite the smaller team, a source said that things are calmer without Meghan and Harry. Keep up to date with the latest royal news with our daily royal newsletter. Click here to find out more.  A source said: “One of the main issues with Harry and Meghan when they were part of the working family was their inability to understand how things worked. It’s been a lot simpler without them kicking off over why they couldn’t just do what they wanted. “Things are a lot calmer.” Sophie Wessex, who has been described as the royal familyaposs secret weapon, will take on an increased public role going forward.

But we could see temperatures soon double with a heat-wave set to arrive inside two weeks. The mercury could be set to hit C, meaning it could be a scorcher over the May Bank Holiday. Climate pattern La Nina will play a large part in the sudden spike. Warm air is predicted to sweep across Northern Europe and the UK at the start of next month.Meteorologist Jim Dale claims some very warm weather is in front of us.“There will definitely be some spikes of heat as we go into summer when I expect to see temperatures in the high Cs or even the low Cs, the British Weather Services expert said. “This is largely because of a balancing effect which, after the colder period of weather over the past couple of months, dominated by a northerly airflow, should revert and come from a more southerly direction. “This will bring more in the way of hotter weather as we go through the end of spring and into summer. “This summer could be up there with the warmer ones from the past ten years, it is more likely to turn out one of the warmer ones that to be cooler.” Friday will be dry with lots of sunshine expected, and just some patchy fair-weather cloud.  A nice weekend is forecast across England and Wales, with cloud in some parts of Scotland.Until the temperatures soar, the Met Office says we should expect chilly evenings, with frost possible.UK Weather Forecast Today: A cold start, but dry and sunny weather follow.

That is until a friend sent her a photo of American actress Samantha Futerman, who looked exactly like her. Anais watched videos of Samantha on YouTube and did some digging into her background, discovering that she had the same date of birth and she had been adopted as well.Anais sent a Facebook friend request to Samantha - with a message asking I was wondering where you were born  - and it led to a reunion that started out like the biggest blind date, she said.Both were stunned to discover that they were sisters - with Anais being an only child raised in Paris and Samantha one of three children to parents in the US state of New Jersey. Against all odds, the pair had found each other and unravelled a secret they didnapost know existed. Anaisapos paperwork in Busan, South Korea, stated that she was born to a single mum and didnapost have any siblings. She was a fashion design student at Central Saint Martins in London in December  when a friend tagged her in a Facebook post with a screen grab of someone who looked like her.  Anais told the Sun: “Clicking through I saw a screenshot of a YouTube video - with me in it. ‘That’s weird,’ I thought, ‘When did I make a video ’ I was sure it was a joke - unless I was so drunk that I’d made a video and didn’t remember.She did some digging and found videos of her lookalike. Anais, now living back in Paris, added: “It was the weirdest thing, I just couldn’t understand it. Our hair was the same, the girl even had freckles – which is really unusual for an Asian girl. But she was talking in an American accent. She tried to stay calm, but she suspected something amazing was unfolding, so she started her online search for the woman.

In February , the same friend spotted the same woman in a trailer for the film  and Over.Now knowing her name, Anais looked up Samantha on Google and discovered they were born on the same day - November ,  - and she was also from South Korea.A voice in her head told her: Sheaposs your twin. Anais called her mum, who was just as excited, and then sent a Facebook message to Samantha. After getting no reply, she sent a tweet to Samantha telling her to check her Facebook messages. Samantha, who was getting her nails done at the time, thought someone was using her photo, but her jaw dropped when she read Anaisapos message. She started to wonderthey were twins separated at birth, and sent a message to Anais, along with a picture of her adoption records, asking: Could we be twins  A week later, they had their first video call. Though both nervous, they realised they were incredibly similar and chatted for three hours. Samantha said: “You know when you hear the echo of your voice on a speakerphone  That’s what it was like when I heard Anais laugh. At am we finally said goodbye and I stumbled to bed in shock and awe.” Three months later, in May , the sisters and their families met in person for the first time in London. Anais said: “We couldn’t stop staring at each other. But we didn’t hug, it was just too emotional. It felt like she was my mirror, but one that didn’t move the same time as me. Then I reached my hand out, poked her gently on the head and we both started laughing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teacher suspended after putting foot","story":"NewsTeacher suspended after putting foot on neck of black schoolboy, , in sick jokeThe unnamed white teacher at Lamar Elementary in Greenville, Texas, reportedly texted the picture to the boys mum as a \"joke\".

Some viewers supported the method - with many viewers saying it was the most efficient way to serve it up. It shows a kitchen tray being filled with steaming containers of food - starting off with chips. A portion of ribs is then added, followed by stir-fried noodles and a saucy-looking chicken curry, egg fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. Salt and pepper chicken is placed on top before the chicken is drizzled with sauce and some prawn crackers are added, along with a portion of spring rolls. The plating of the dish has left people ided - with one viewer dubbing it the best idea. Another commented: Thank you for this brilliant amazing thing you have created.

Barely hanging on to le, Fang Lang was among the last survivors to be pulled from the frozen seas following the tragedy in which , perished. The -year-old boy was one of eight third-class Chinese passengers who were aboard the luxury steamship when it struck an iceberg midway through its maiden voyage to New York, in the early hours of April , . But while the fate of the Titanic’s richest passengers, such as “The Unsinkable” Molly Brown and John Jacob Astor, one of the wealthiest men in the world, has filled history books and fascinated film fans, the stories of many of the ship’s other ­travellers quickly sank without trace. Ah Lam, Fang Lang, Len Lam, Cheong Foo, Chang Chip, Ling Hee, Lee Bing and Lee Ling – mariners believed to have been heading to the Caribbean for work – had been crammed with other third-class passengers in steerage, in the bowels of the huge liner. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Two of the Chinese men drowned but five of the others managed to escape on to leboats. The sixth, Fang, had grabbed hold of debris and was moments from freezing to death when he was rescued after just one of those ­leboats turned back to search for survivors. The way the teenager was found, shivering in the darkness as he clung on to the floating door in the freezing waters, went on to inspire a famous scene in the  Hollywood ­blockbuster Titanic. Director James Cameron ended up cutting the original character based on Fang but used his rescue to inspire the tragic moment Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jack ­sacrices himself so that Kate ­Winslet’s Rose can survive. Now, though, a new ­documentary has traced what happened to Fang and the other ­Chinese survivors, and uncovered how, rather than being honoured for having survived peacetime’s deadliest maritime disaster, once they were back on dry land they were vilied and expelled from the US, and later from Britain too.  The Six, which has just premiered in China, also tracked down descendants of the survivors, some of whom had no idea their relatives had been aboard the ship because they had never spoken about the disaster. The names of the eight Chinese ­passengers can still be found on a single third-class ticket, suggesting all the men knew each other and boarded the Titanic in Southampton together. British film-maker Arthur Jones, along with American historian Steven Schwankert, discovered the men, who were aged between  and , were heading for Cuba and had been scheduled to board the Annetta, a freighter, in New York once the Titanic docked. All but one of the eight men, Lee Bing, were single.  Steven explains: “The reason they were ­travelling on the Titanic in the first place is for work. They were professional mariners.” The Titanic was four days into its journey when it scraped along the side of the iceberg. Water began to fill the underwater compartments and less than three hours later the ship had plunged into the sea, taking all but  people down with it. Of the non-British men bunked in steerage, only % survived. It is believed the Chinese sailors may have cheated death because they didn’t understand instructions to stay in their rooms and were therefore able to escape to the leboats.  But unlike other Titanic survivors, the six men were maligned and persecuted once they had arrived safely in New York, due to a strong anti-Chinese sentiment in the West in the early th century. They were also ly accused of saving their own lives ahead of women and ­children by hiding in the leboats. However records show they tried to help other survivors. After being pulled from the waters, Fang Lang later rowed the leboat that rescued him and helped ferry everyone on board to safety. Little more was known of the men until Jones and Schwankert began their research.  They discovered that within  hours of their arrival at the immigration inspection station on New York’s Ellis Island, the men were expelled from the country because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a controversial law that barred the immigration of Chinese people to the US. Unlike other survivors, they also received no medical aid. Director Arthur says: “They were not treated humanely. We know they lost close friends on board. Not only did they have to leave in  hours, they were held ­overnight in custody.” They were forced to travel to the Caribbean to work on fruit ships, before heading to the UK because of a shortage of sailors due to men fighting in the First World War. Chang Chip, , became increasingly unwell and passed away from pneumonia in .  He was buried in an unmarked grave in London. The other five worked together in Britain until , with some marrying and having children. But then in another cruel twist, a new anti-immigrant policy forced them all to leave without notice, leaving their loved ones behind. Ah Lam was deported to Hong Kong, Ling Hee headed for India while Lee Bing emigrated to Canada. Fang Lang sailed between Britain and Hong Kong for years before becoming a citizen of the country that rejected him – the US. The film-makers tracked down his ­American-Chinese son, Tom Fong, who was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, nearly half a century after the Titanic sinking.  The -year-old revealed throughout his childhood his relatives had hinted his father had survived a shipwreck but that he had never spoken about it or even his mother Marie, now . Fang, a waiter in Milwaukee, was  when Tom was born, and died in  aged . Tom only learned his dad survived the Titanic when a family member mentioned it  years after his death. He says: “I asked my mother. She’d never heard about my father being on this boat and it sinking.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Researchers later found out that Fang wrote to his relatives on Xiachuan, an island in the South China Sea, about the accident, and that one person there has a poem Fang wrote detailing his struggle to stay afloat in the frigid ocean as others cried for help in the darkness around him. But Tom, who owns a restaurant, hasn’t told anyone about his father until now – for fear people wouldn’t believe him.

You get people who might be going down a bad track and it#s trying to change those kids# ways to get them back on the right track.#The only thing you leave in the hills is footsteps.#Michael O#Donnell.When taking groups of Royal Marines into the hills, Mr O#Donnell told them the only thing they should leave behind is their footsteps.But he said a combination of more people using the outdoors and a lack of education about the Countryside Code, which tells people to #leave no trace# after visiting beauty spots, is causing havoc.#When we were taking people into the hills, we used to say to the guys the only thing you leave in the hills is footsteps,# he said.#I#ve got quite a few friends who live up on the Isle of Skye and they#ve been inundated with litter.#They#ve had bags of human waste tied to their gate.#In addition, he said cheap tents aimed at festival-goers were easier to leave behind than specialist mountain equipment.#It#s because some of the festival tents are not expensive, shall we say,# said Mr O#Donnell.#They#re not spending £ or £ on a mountain tent so people aren#t bothered.#I suppose the country does have a bit of a throwaway culture.

when you have the madness of the Scottish Championship to contend with This is football, indeed.It was a madcap night of fitba up in the Highlands last night with two red cards, disallowed goals, two actual goals that counted and two managers very unhappy with one referee.What more do you want Well, Dundee certainly want a bit more.And, forget the whole conceding-against-nine-men thing, they should have been enjoying a first-ever league win at Inverness Caledonian Thistle.Because even against  opponents, the Dark Blues were bossing the contest in the second half.A major part of that was the introduction of Charlie Adam at the break.Dundee weren’t miles behind Caley in the first half but never really got hold of the ball in midfield.That all changed with the talisman in there.And he looked like a man determined to prove a point.Covid hit and while Adam was out, Dundee found some form and a formation that worked.When he ed, however, fitting the former Scotland man into the set-up proved dficult.What do you do, change a successful set-up to get your best player into the team Or make the tough call to leave him on the bench and stick with what’s working And it was working, up until the first half last night.Dundee had won three and drawn twice playing with two in the middle of the park.However, they needed three after a poor first half and manager James McPake must have been delighted to see the improvement in his side in the second .Because they were the better team – once more it was finding that killer edge that was missing.Then their hosts being reduced to nine men made Dundee overwhelming favourites to take the points.And it looked like they had done just that with Jason Cummings heading in, only for a belated offside call.But they were caught napping at the other end.It was remarkable and so very Dundee to see a team with nine men get in behind and open the scoring.It could have been a real embarrassment, losing to nine men.But they dug themselves out of the hole, with Lee Ashcroft once more the man to step up when needed.And what a fine header it was, too.I’m determined not to focus too much on conceding to nine men, though.Because the overall performance in the second half was a very positive one – one that should give hope for the upcoming play-offs –they finally secure that.Six unbeaten with Adam looking in mean form, the Dark Blues should be looking forward to taking on the play-offs.But it is Dundee, there will no doubt be more madness to come.Who needs a Super League when you have this Not often will I shake up the order of this column.Not often will I record Monday Night Football and watch the preview while the live match is actually being played.However, this European Super League nonsense is shaking everything up this week.I’ve no doubt the Bond-villain types who came up with this scheme via Zoom calls from their carved-out volcano islands expected a bit of a reaction.I can’t think they expected to unite the entire footballing world against them, though.As we’ve seen all too often in our game, clubs just seem to enjoy quarrelling with each other – often to the detriment of the game as a whole.Now, though, the “founding members” of the newly-announced European Super League have done what few have done before – got everybody in the game on the same page.I have to admit it was dficult to keep my eye on the ball at Inverness last night while the fun and games were going on.Teams pulling out, people resigning and all sorts of crazy going on.Proper soap opera stuff.And all this couldn’t have happened to a better bunch of blokes, to be honest.What might happen now, though, is after this fright – and hopefully the ESL is dead – people might actually sort out the problems that led to its formation in the first place.It’s a big game for Kilmarnock in the Premiership tonight – not so much for Dundee United.My guess is they’d quite like to get this one out of the way so they can concentrate on the big cup clash this weekend up at Aberdeen.However, keeping up their recent form wouldn’t be such a bad warm-up.Very quietly the Tangerines have racked up four wins on the spin and only conceded once in five matches.One defeat – to champions Rangers – in their last nine.Very, very decent from Micky Mellon’s men. Dundee #robbed# of opening goal Inverness red a #shocking decision# # Managers James

potential closure of Perth’s H#M branch.The store, based in St John#s Shopping Centre, plans to reopen on Monday but staff have been made aware of its potential closure.The potential closure has caused concern among staff members, who may be moved to stores where.One staff member, who wishes to remain anonymous, says moving to another store may not be possible due to travel costs.They believe around  to  staff will be affected.They said: #I may be deployed to other stores in the area including the Dundee branches or Edinburgh#s new branch opening this summer.#I am hopeful I will be accommodated in a nearby store, but this might not be feasible as I’m on a low contract, so the travel costs will probably outweigh the wage I receive.#I feel this might be the same situation for many of the younger staff on lower contracts.#This comes after the clothing retailer announced last year that it would close hundreds of stores, but did not specy which stores would be affected.A spokesperson for H#M said: #Our store in Perth is due to reopen on Monday th April, as per the latest government guidelines.#We are however, in the beginning of consultations with our colleagues about the potential closure of this store.#We are working to support our colleagues at this time.#Local politicians say they hope the store can remain open despite the fast-paced changes to high streets.Councillor Chris Ahern of Perth and Kinross Council said: #It is very sad whenever we lose a shop on the high street.#I hope that their consultations will result in the store remaining open.#He added: #It is something we are going to see more of as a result of the last year and lockdowns, and the move by stores to online selling.#It would be interesting to seeH#M are increasing their presence online and closing stores as a result of the increased online sales.#Our high streets have been changing for a number of years but Covid- has accelerated that change, and I’m afraid we are all going to see a new type of city centre and high street in the future.#Perth city centre has taken a signicant hit in recent months, with numerous retailers having announced store closures.In February last year, administrators revealed Beales Department Store would close for the final time.The decision caused #immense disappointment# in the Fair City, with  other stores across the UK having also permanently shut its doors.The store’s former premises on St John Street has now been put up for lease.Meanwhile, High Street store Phase Eight announced its Perth store#s permanent closure last June, with the retailer having announced plans to relocate staff to other stores where possible.The city centre was dealt further economic blow just two months later, when Argos revealed it would not be reopening.By October, ‘institution’ school unorm shop, Stevensons Aitken and Niven made the decision to move where in the city.It has since moved to the city’s Scott Street.Newsletter

He loved parties and singing karaoke and had such a fun personality.“In  he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and for a while it was okay.“But then he took a real turn for the worst… He stopped engaging in activities and couldn’t do any of the things he used to enjoy.“Even watching the football – he was a massive football fan – wasn’t enjoyable for him anymore, he didn’t know what was happening.”Reece describes how his family watched as Craig’s condition declined even further until finally, his fun-loving cousin passed away in , aged .During the last year of his le, Craig was living in a care home, but Reece was upset to discover how few facilities exist for people in Craig’s situation.“Because he was relatively young he had a real dficulty getting into a care home,” Reece said.“There was only one place in the whole of Aberdeen who could take him, despite the fact he had Down syndrome and severe Alzheimer’s, and even when he was there, there were no facilities for people like him at all.“So that was my motivation. I really want to raise money to help people like that have specialist centres where they can go and provide them with activities during the day and things they can do.“I know there have been centres like this, but many of them have closed or merged and the money is just getting cut back and cut back.”Approximately % of people with Down syndrome will develop dementia as they age, meaning that Craig’s position is far from unusual.“Craig was so loved by the family and he never let his Down syndrome affect him, he always had a smile on his face.“But come the last couple of years it was so dferent. It’s like he was here, but he wasn’t here at the same time, which is what the Alzheimer’s did to him.”Reece has a target of raising £, before he sets off next year, and he’s already well on the way to reaching it with £, raised by his GoFundMe page and another £, from a raffle he organised locally.Fundraising during lockdown has been dficult, but the generosity of the public has impressed Reece.“I’m amazed at how much I’ve managed to raise so far,” he said, “I’m nearly halfway to my target already.“We decided to wait until next year to make the trip because hopefully by that time Africa will be more advanced with its Covid vaccine rollout.“But it also gives us more time to raise money and I hope to do more in-person fundraising as soon as restrictions allow.”Sarah Cheung, Stakeholder Engagement Lead at Alzheimer Scotland said: ‘Reece has set himself the challenge of a letime to raise money for Alzheimer Scotland and we are so grateful.#The last year has been dficult for charities as the need for our support has been greater than ever, but most of our usual ways of generating income have been disrupted.#Despite this, supporters like Reece have continued to set themselves incredible challenges to help us make sure nobody faces dementia alone. We are very proud of Reece, who is honouring his cousin in a wonderful way and wish him the best of luck.#To donate to Reece#s challenge, visit his gofundme page.For as little as £. a month you can

warned of consequences for anyone found to have abandoned an animal after six domestic rabbits were found within the space of a week in Moray.The Scottish SPCA was alerted to four rabbits on April  at the side of the road in Mulben, which were caught over the following two days.It comes after a further two rabbits were found on Monday, not far from the first location.Scottish SPCA chief inspector Alison Simpson said: “We’d like to thank the members of the public who alerted us to these animals.“Although we’ve been able to successfully catch the first group of rabbits, unfortunately, we have so far been unable to catch the second two that were most recently spotted.“The first group of rabbits are now safe in the care of one of our animal rescue and rehoming centres.“One of the does was found to be pregnant when caught and she started to give birth in the van on the journey to the centre.#Sadly, all the babies passed away. This is very likely to have been caused by the stress of the situation the animals were found in and has directly contributed to the death of these kits.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/P2_3_36128247-scaled-4-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

I’ve said before thatI didn’t feel I could contribute to the team and compete at the right end of the table then I’d call it a day.“I still feel I’ve got another season or two in the locker where I can contribute.“The stop-start during the pandemic has made me realise that I still have something to offer.“It would have been quite easy not to train and not to play, but I’ve trained all the time all the way through.“I’ve trained every session, played every game and maintained what I feel is a relatively good standard.“Formartine’s loss could be somebody ’s gain. I’ll look at every possible option open to me.“It’s a new start and a fresh challenge and it’s quite exciting.“I don’t wish Formartine anything but success going forward, except when they’re playing against me and wherever I end up I hope they finish behind me.“But I feel ready and I’ve got a bit of fire in the belly and I’m excited about where my future might lie.“I’m still keen to play and still hungry for success.“I still want to win things – that won’t change regardless of age – and I look forward to seeing what happens next season.”McKeown joined Formartine in the summer of  and helped them win the Aberdeenshire Cup in  and , the Highland League Cup in  and the Aberdeenshire Shield in .He had a six-month spell at Brora Rangers during the - campaign and helped the Cattachs win the Highland League before ing to Pitmedden.McKeown then spent two years on the sidelines after sustaining a cruciate ligament injury in October  and a recurrence the following summer.He is disappointed to be leaving Formartine and looks back with the regret that he was unable to help them win the Highland League.McKeown added: “I can’t deny it was a bit of a surprise, because I’ve played every  minutes this season.“I still feel I was contributing to the team and I still feel I can compete with the best in the league in my position.“We won all our games in the league this season and both myself and Paulagreed my performances were up to the required standard.“Paul openly said I was outstanding against Annan Athletic in the Scottish Cup and that was against a League Two team, having not been training for three months.“So to come back and put in a level of performance like that it kind of baffles you as to why you’re shown the door.“It’s a bit hard to comprehend, I respect the decision, but I don’t agree with it.“Ultimately the football club moves on and we’ll go in dferent directions. I’ve got nothing against the club, the manager or the chairman.“We’ve underachieved in terms of trophies and titles and there’s no getting away from that.“I have to take some of the flak for that, because I’m a big player.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown. We have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust, like everyone , to the daily challenges this  has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares. We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.Let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind PeopleScotland, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures march 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks.

Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland. Of course, this has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a very dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature now.Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland.Sir,It’s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is utterly heartbreaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken and to keep yourself safe.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"community learning transfers to argyll and bute trust","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Other villagers have complained, among other things, about current noise levels from the quarry already being far too high and being heard inside homes # including a th century castle.According to some residents, retired villagers can no longer enjoy sitting outside their homes because of the sound of crushing machines.There was upset recently when the quarry upped its noise limit to  decibels without the nearby community getting a say.#That is the limit for quarries in rural areas but this is not a rural area, this is a village. The quarry is just  metres away,# said Simon Hunt, who runs  luxury accommodation at Kilmartin Castle with his partner Stef Burgeon. The couple have expressed fears the racket from the quarry could damage their business and threaten future growth plans.However, a report from council officers said noise mitigation measures had been invested in by the quarry  and that the most recent assessment demonstrated that it was having the desired effect with the works #practically inaudible# at the survey locations. Environmental Health was also content with those findings.Ms Burgeon and Mr Hunt say the only sound-proofing that has gone up so far at the quarry is scaffolding with insulation board cable tied to it.A council spokesperson told The Oban Times: #There are separate ongoing investigations by the council’s environmental health service under the Environmental Protection Act  which are still to be concluded. The determination of the planning application and Environmental Health investigation are not interdependent. In the event of noise levels being determined to be a statutory nuisance, the council can initiate formal action under this Act.#Yesterdayofficers were recommending members of the Planning, Protective Services and Licensing Committee approve MacLeod#s application subject to  conditions but were also recommending a discretionary hearing so any objectors and supporters can speak.Ms Burgeon said calls for a public meeting had previously been ignored.#This could be a win-win situation as long as the quarry puts in proper noise control like other quarries do around the world.#If they put up proper sound baffling that actually works then everyone would be happy. They could continue quarrying and the villagers could get on with enjoying their lives in peace.#Jane MacLeod from MacLeod Construction Limited said as part of the planning process sound tests had been carried out by a leading environmental consultancy firm approved by the council.Baffles and other noise reduction steps taken by the company have reduced noise levels signicantly, although previous noise levels were #very close to and often within permitted levels,# she said, adding the consultant#s report sent to the council indicated that noise levels are now #below background noise# such as passing vehicles and birdsong, and are well within permitted levels.There are no rock breakers in the quarry and #we do not crush rock in the quarry,# she said."},{"url":null,"title":"new door to door vaccine bus","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Problems have remained since they re-opened.Landowners and farmers remain plagued by fly-tippers. Throughout the pandemic picturesque sights across Scotland have been routinely spoiled by the unwelcome sight of garden and other waste.SLE chief executive Sarah-Jane Laing said: #Ending the scourge of fly-tipping and healing our rural communities is at the heart of SLE’s priorities for the next parliament. In our manesto we call on all parties to commit to prevent, detect and prosecute fly-tipping offences, with tough sentences for repeat offenders.#Fly-tipping has serious social, environmental and health implications. It poses a threat to people and wildle, damages our environment and spoils people#s enjoyment of the outdoors.#It is more than an eyesore # it is dangerous, and it is a crime. Too many landowners and farmers find themselves in a vicious cycle of costly clean-ups. Forced, as victims, to not only have to remove potentially hazardous materials, but also to bear the financial burden of waste crime. Rural businesses can find themselves liable for bills of thousands of pounds to clean up land that has been fly-tipped, with many offered no support from their local authority.#We are pleased that, after representation from SLE and others, the Scottish Government agreed to give equal weight to fly-tipping in its forthcoming litter strategy.#We will work with the next government and all parties to protect our rural communities from fly-tipping with tough measures and comprehensive cover, to ensure victims of fly-tipping are no longer out of pocket to clear it up.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club holds april medals","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

what now WeaskedDr Georgia Perona-Wright, who is a senior lecturer in Immunology at the University of Glasgow, to weigh in.Can I still get Covid, after Irsquom vaccinated Yes, you can. The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

Some indication of Scott Parkrsquos status within the current and proposed Development Plans would also have aided transparency.ldquoNowhere do I see any attempt to reuse any of the existing buildings, which you might think might be a compelling reason in sustainability terms to examine this site rather more closely in the initial site search.ldquoAnd without a detailed brief being indicated, not only is it dficult to look at the fit and design options of the ious sites, but also it is unclear as to the centralisation of community facilities proposed here.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council has made use of an online digital exercise supplemented with an unmanned exhibition in the Galashiels Transport Interchange to provide a robust consultation.ldquoWe would like to place on record our thanks to all of the people that have taken the time to submit comments on the proposals since the consultation went live on March .Anyone interested in making a comment can do so through the link on the councilrsquos website or directly to Galacampus@scotborders.gov.ukldquoFollowing the closure of this initial phase of the consultation, the feedback will be reflected upon and used to help prepare a report to the council in late spring recommending the next steps for the project.The full letter from Charles StrangI write on behalf of Scottish Borders Greens to draw your readersrsquo attention to the imminent closing date for submissions on the proposals for the ldquonew Gala Academy.Comments are due in on or before Monday  April. It has been suggested where, and in the columns of local newspapers, that this consultation is a sham.Why is it important that readers take the time and make the effort to respond to this consultation  It is not because the consultation itself has great merit.The Council itself has taken planning advice from consultants which tells them effectively that they need pay no attention to the results of any consultation.It may be that they have sought this independent advice because their own planners have maintained their professional judgements that the proposed site, given in perpetuity to the people of Galashiels as a ldquopleasure ground, is a key green space which should continue to be maintained as such.That is how they have described it in the recent consultative draft Local Development Plan, and no doubt in Development Plans before that.The Council appears reluctant to share their brief for this major improvement in secondary school provision for the Galashiels catchment area.It seems unlikely that, as has been suggested, there is no brief for this multi million pound expenditure: some form of brief would be essential to assess even one single option, never mind a range.Another useful role for any brief would be to examine the potential for retention of any of the educational facilities which already comprise the secondary school campus. This is a particularly important aspect when one considers the amount of embodied energy present in the existing buildings on the site. Plainly when one is addressing the sustainability of any development the existing buildings and site characteristics are critical factors.No, on the face of it this is not a genuine consultation, but a hollow exercise seeking to justy an Education Authority taking the easy option of expanding onto a greenfield site just because they think they can.The people who care about public open space, and trust in local government, should still be seeking to make their voices heard."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-sees-no-cases-recorded-last-24-hours","story":"NO cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the last  hours.The Scottish Government released the latest data at pm today .There have now been , cases of COVID-in the region since the start of the pandemic ndash an increase of one over the weekend.Nationally, , positive cases have been recorded since March last year.According to the most recent data, there are still fewer than five people in hospital in the Borders with the virus.This has been the case every day through March and April, .You might also be interested in:Borders could get pound.m boost from major eventset for region, says councilBorders considers hiring empty homes officerto bring end to vacant propertiesMan assaulted partner and then gave abuse to nursesat Borders General Hospital"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-parliament-election-borders-candidates-hustings","story":"IN the lead-up to next monthrsquos Scottish Parliament elections, three hustings relevant to Borders voters will be held in the coming days.Tomorrowat .pm a virtual hustings over Zoom will be hosted by Borders environmental group Tweedgreen and Tweeddale Peace Group.This meeting will cover the constituency of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.All constituency candidates have been invited, with organisers saying questions will ldquofocus on the climate, peace and justice ndash all fundamental issues that are interlinked with the climate crisis, the COVID pandemic, and a green and just recovery from their effects.On Thursday eveningthe Liberal Democratsrsquo candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, Catriona Bhatia, will participate in a National Farmers Unionhustings at pm .A spokesperson for the NFU said: ldquoThis webinar will give members the opportunity to hear from and question the lead rural affairs candidates from each of the five main parties.And on April  there will be a West Linton event held over Zoom between .pm-pm.The third Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale hustings will welcome candidates from the five main parties represented at this yearrsquos election ndash more candidates could be added before the event.To join tomorrows Tweedgreen event and submit questions, email: tweedgreenpeebles@googlemail visit the NFU Scotland Facebook page to access the Zoom link for Thursdayrsquos hustings and to join the West Linton meeting, register at: tinyurl wlhustings and send questions to westlintonhustings@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"broughton-john-buchan-way-trees-plan-opposed-campaigners","story":"PROPOSALS to plant trees in a National Scenic Areain the Borders have been met with opposition from locals.The plans for Peeblesshires John Buchan Way involve afforestation across  hectares, mainly for commercial purposes to produce timber, while native broadleaves will also be planted.The new woodland creation would be set ldquowithin the property at Broughton Hope and would see trees planted in one of the Borders two National Scenic Areas.With the consultation process having started, Broughton Community Council was contacted by RDS Forestry, leading to opposition from the community.Fiona Pagett, who has lived in Broughton for  years, has set up a Facebook group called lsquoSave our Glen - JBWrsquo which now has more than  members.:Outcry over bizarre plans to demolish historic mansion near the BordersldquoIrsquom incredibly heartened, though not remotely surprised, at the immediate and enormous opposition to the planting proposal at Broughton Hope, said Ms Pagett, an estate agent.ldquoWe are becoming engulfed in Sitka spruce plantations as the Scottish Government ploughs towards its spurious target of mass planting in the belief this will solve climate change.ldquoIt is disregarding our treasured and erse landscape and threatening much flora and fauna, added Ms Pagett, who lives in the village with her son Angus and daughter Katie.ldquoI have high hopes that this particular proposal, which affects the John Buchan Way, local residents, the shepherd and would negatively impact tourism, will gain the attention of those able to stop it in its tracks.According to Ms Pagett, -year-old shepherd Geordie Wilsonrsquos role ldquowill be removedthe proposals on the land go ahead.

In this instalment ndash the last of the series ndash we speak to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP.Q. What is your party planning to do in the Borders A. Obviously for the Borders, as with the whole of the country, recovery from COVID is a top priority.To get the economy growing again, to support retail, to support tourism.Central to that, of course, will be infrastructure.The SNP has already delivered a signicant infrastructure project, which is very important to the Borders, in terms of the railway.Our manesto will set out plans to build on that and to go further. But to get the economy of the Borders up and running again, and to support growth and the overall wellbeing of people living in the Borders, will be a top priority.Q. Like many local authorities, Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What is your party doing on that front A. I think the Scottish Government led the way in declaring a climate emergency.The Scottish Parliament in the last term of parliament has passed what, by any standards, are considered to be world-leading targets to become a net zero emissions country by . And to achieve by  a  per cent reduction in emissions.That puts us right at the leading edge of ambition in terms of ending our contribution to climate change. Setting the targets is the easy bit.Delivering that is, obviously, much more challenging. At the end of last year we published an updated climate change plan including about  dferent policies across how we heat our homes, how we travel around, agriculture, reducing emissions in industry, that will be necessary to meet those targets.Government has a leadership role to play, but to succeed we have to work in partnership with local authorities and, indeed, with the private sector.Obviously, hosting the COP  in Glasgow later this year will be a real catalyst, I think, for the Scottish Government and everybody in Scotland to showcase our ambition, but also to showcase what we are doing and encourage the rest of the world to join with us.Q. You have said that you would like an independent Scotland to join the EU. Would that mean a potentially damaging hard border between Scotland and the rest of the UK A. I donrsquot want a border. I have never wanted a border. I donrsquot want a hard border in future.In terms of the free movement of people, an independent Scotland would continue to be in the common travel area.So there would be no hard border in terms of people.Obviously, in terms of goods and services, our priority would be to keep trade flowing.It is Brexit that has created the issues of borders and many of our exports right now are facing real dficulty and losing a lot of business and a lot of money because of the border dficulties from the UK to the rest of Europe.Independence gives us the opportunity to become part of the European single market again ndash seven times the size of the UK market ndash but to continue to work with the UK and EU to keep trade flowing in both directions between Scotland and England.Q. What would you say your biggest goal was in an independent Scotland A. My biggest goal right now and in an independent Scotland is to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow up.Make it a great country for children to learn in, to grow up in, to make sure we can eradicate child poverty and for Scotland to be a confident, prosperous, fair and equal country.We know that is possible becausewe look across Europe right now at countries very similar in size to Scotland, but often without the vast natural resources that Scotland has, these are countries that are amongst the wealthiest, the fairest and the happiest countries in the world.If places like Norway and Denmark can do that, there is absolutely no reason why Scotland canrsquot as well.Q. Why do you think Scotland voted lsquonorsquo in  A. There is no doubt a iety of reasons.Scotland came closer to voting lsquoyesrsquo than many people would ever have predicted.For people like me, we have to continue to build support, trust and confidence and persuade people. In ,  per cent of people voted lsquoyesrsquo. Most opinion polls right now, including one just published in the last hour [the Border spoke to Ms Sturgeon on April ], show that independence is now supported by a majority of people in Scotland. So already we have moved on signicantly from .Once the COVID pandemic is over, I think people in Scotland should have the right to consider that again and make their choice.Readersrsquo questionsQ. Scotlandrsquos PISAresults in science and maths have dropped under SNP governments. Why has education got worse under the SNP A. We look at the data for exam results in Scotland, we see both attainment rising and the attainment gap closing.We have still got more work to do.That is why we are investing heavily in education and in education recovery, in more teachers.We have invested, over the last parliament, three quarters of a billion pounds specically closing the attainment gap.When we publish our manesto next week, we will set out our plans for the next parliament. Scottish education is high quality.There is work to do to make sure it continues to improve and that we close the poverty-related attainment gap. Part, of course, closing the poverty-related attainment gap is not just focusing on attainment in schools, but focusing on poverty.And we have already taken more action than any previous government in Scotland ndash establishing the Scottish Child Payment, for example, and wersquove put forward plans in this election to double that in the next parliament.A key part in raising educational attainment is to lt children out of poverty.Q. Would there be an Indyref ,you were to lose a second independence referendum A. I donrsquot intend for that to be the situation, so it is a completely hypothetical question."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-issues-statement-time-great-sadness-birthday","story":"The Queen has sent a

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page. Search #Lindsay Ramsay Walk at Westport# on www.justgivingLindsay is well on her way towards her fundraising target, having already received donations amounting to more than £ by the time the Courier went to press.A Macmillan Cancer support spokesperson said: #At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we#ve got. If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"council leader backs islands decision","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is very welcome news.#He had also said in a report, which was written in advance of the announcement: #Following the first announcement of forthcoming changes I wrote to Aileen Campbell MSP, then cabinet secretary for communities and local government, seeking an urgent meeting.#We managed to arrange this in early course and I was able to relay to her the very real need for clarity on arrangements for islands, some of which have been in dferent levels to the mainland for some time.#It is to be hoped that, by the time this report is considered by the council, the required clarity has been provided.#The direct impact is of course on the islands themselves but it is also important to bear in mind considerations for adjacent mainland communities as well as Argyll and Bute#s overall social and economic recovery from the pandemic.#"},{"url":null,"title":"support local causes through new argyll community lottery","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The site will be review-based to ensure all members meet the high standards required.Founder Felix Newall-Smith, who is based in Dorset, said: #Amazingrazing modernises the way horse and livery owners connect, giving everyone a long-awaited place necessary to build great relationships before even meeting. No more stressed-out horse or livery owners will mean happier healthier horses – and humans.#The concept for Amazingrazing came to Mr Newall-Smith, aged , six years ago when he owned a horse in The New Forest and struggled to find somewhere suitable when the livery yard closed down.He saw the need for a professionally managed service when he realised the only way to find places currently was through social media groups, local connections or #outdated websites#.#I thought it was mad that in this day and age, the main way people find livery is word-of-mouth and Facebook groups,# Mr Newall-Smith said. #I thought there must be a better way.#After being made redundant from his job shortly before the Covid- pandemic began, Mr Newall-Smith, a design engineer who studied at Bournemouth University, decided to develop Amazingrazing with his free time at home during lockdown providing the perfect opportunity to get the business off the ground.Livery owner and equestrian business consultant John McDonald said: #I work with liveries and meet horse owners every day and know that finding the right horse owners for your yard is critical.#Liveries are a community and getting the right balance of personalities is important to help develop harmony on the yard. Amazingrazing allows livery and horse owners to get to know each other before making a commitment. This, I am certain, will help greatly to take the stress out of running a livery and owning a horse.#Find out more about Amazingrazing, which officially launches in June , at Amazingrazing.A lot of horse owners like the livery they are at but when they move they struggle to find one which has similar features as most liveries don’t have websites and,they do, they are often out of date.Livery and horse owners often clash over the best way to look after the horse. To the owner, the horse is an extension of their family and they want to make sure it is done correctly, however, often the livery has dferent ideas on how this should be done, and this often leads to disputes.The cost of livery can be considerable, sometimes similar to renting a flat. A lot of the time, there are no contracts between either party, so when things go wrong, it can get messy quickly and there are many horror stories from both sides. Issues such as neglect of horses, horse owners leaving the horse and not ing, unpaid field rent and bullying are just some issues. There are dedicated Facebook pages for both bad liveries and bad horse owners.Livery yards in general don#t struggle to find horse owners but they do struggle to find horse owners that are reliable and trustworthy, pay on time, aren’t dficult to work with and look after their horse properly. They want a service which allows them to vet horse owners and their horses before they meet them.Equally, horse owners want to be able to vet liveries before travelling long distances and committing to large amounts of money to a yard that does not have the facilities they are after.When using the Amazingrazing site, users can:In the last year, Amazingrazing founder Felix Newall-Smith has conducted surveys with horse and livery owners, created a Facebook page which has so far amassed , followers, developed and tested a #click through# website with potential future users. He then started the ball rolling with a Weymouth-based web developer and the website, which is now  per cent complete, is due to launch in June .To get the word out about Amazingrazing and raise the business profile, so far Mr Newall-Smith has employed a guerrilla marketing technique using social media presence, brand ambassadors, online influencers and targeted equestrian business networking events with great success so far.With very little competition, Mr Newall-Smith believes that Amazingrazing will quickly take over the market. Once established, there are plans to improve the service, giving members greater benefits such as training on how to look after a horse and how to improve livery businesses as well as an Amazingrazing app."},{"url":null,"title":"superb play from mcconnachie in dunavertys spring meeting","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

ndash sometimes at great personal cost.I believe that offering our NHS staff an inflation-busting four per cent pay rise is well deserved, although I wish it could be more.South of the Border, one per cent is being imposed.This is simply an insult.There is a perception that our NHS is lsquobrokenrsquo in some way.I do not believe this, but I do see a huge organisation which now needs to re-invent itself, not for the first time, into an efficient, modern support for us all.However, our NHS is genuinely under threat.Privatisation is not just a scare word.The Transatlantic Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back control of our own

being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"groundwork-begins-new-46m-high-school-wallyford","story":"The new Wallyford Secondary Learning Campus will be built on farmland west of Masons Way and is expected to take about two years to build.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said that the preparatory groundworks would include the erection of fencing around the perimeter, and excavation and removal of topsoil.

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way! The flowers will die off and the little tomatoes will begin to form ndash thatrsquos when gardeners will happily report that ldquothe first truss has set!Once the first truss is set, yoursquoll need to provide additional feeding and this is best done in liquid form whilst watering using a specialist feed such as the well-respected lsquoTomoritersquo, for example.As the season progresses, you may decide to remove some of the older leaves to let more light in and help the fruit ripen. For tomatoes that havenrsquot ripened at the end of the season, use them in the green for chutney or bring them indoors and leave them on the windowsill to ripen.And then...If yoursquove enjoyed growing your own tomatoes and plan to do it again next year, make sure that you remove the old plants completely so that yoursquore not leaving any rotting vegetation and disease that could affect next yearrsquos tomatoes.As always, the plant team are always very happy to help with tips and advice ndash so much easier now that wersquore allowed to be open again, of course!Yoursquoll also find lots of information on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"doors-reopening-dirleton-castle-tantallon-castle","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandis preparing to open the gates to more than  ticketed sites, including Tantallon Castle, near North Berwick, and Dirleton Castle, across the country this month.The historic sites will open on April  following the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed dates for the reopening of the tourism sector and mainland Scotland moving to Covid protection level three.New technology is also being implemented as part of HESrsquos new visitor offering.Visitors will be able to explore the stories of many of the sites in innovative ways through downloadable maps, family trails, quizzes and quests, music, poetry and personal accounts to tell stories throughout the centuries, videos exploring Gaelic culture and words, and digital fly-throughs to areas usually restricted to visitors.Visitors will be able to enjoy access to the historic outdoor spaces at both sites, as well as the Doocot, Gazebo, Hallyburton Range and first floor of the Ruthven Range at Dirleton Castle.All visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations visitors must wear face coverings in any indoor enclosed spaces, including retail and catering areas and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe know how keen our members and visitors are to get back to our sites, so wersquore delighted to reopen over  per cent of our properties on April .ldquoScotlandrsquos heritage sector is a key part of our tourism offer ndash from providing jobs to increasing our wellbeing ndash and, in addition to reopening the sites that reopened last year, we will also reopen further sites on a phased basis over the upcoming months.Tantallon Castle will open daily, am-pm, from April , while Dirleton Castle will open on the same date and from then on will be open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays between the same times.For more information, go to restarthistory.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prince-philips-visits-east-lothian","story":"On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the news of his death, mere months before his th birthday, saying that he passed away peacefully last Friday morning at Windsor Castle.Since then people across the world have been sharing their condolences and been paying tribute to the late Duke, including here in East Lothian.Over the years the Duke of Edinburgh has visited East Lothian on several occasions, both solo and with the Queen, to whom he was married to for more than  years.From Haddington and North Berwick to Musselburgh and the opening of Yellowcraig Caravan Park in , he has visited several parts of the county over his  years.One of his first visits is believed to be in  with the then Princess Elizabeth, a year before her coronation.Over the years he re-visited the county on several occasions.Another was  when he inspected the British Legion parade in North Berwick, he also opened Yellowcraig Caravan park in .He has also visited Haddington on numerous occasions, in ,  and .Prince Philiprsquos last public visit is believed to be with the Queen, who was  years old at the time, to Musselburgh Racecourse in , when the couple helped it celebrate its th birthday.

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw. This was Campbell country when he lived here, but he was under the protection of a Campbell chief, how ironic was that  Robrsquos mother had been a Campbell, and yoursquove seen how MacGregors could be both enemies and family with Campbells.She pointed at the base of the ruins: ldquoThose stones are the foundations of the old walls. Now close your eyes for a moment, Finn. Imagine we are in the house in Robrsquos time. There are no windows, a thatched roof above us and a peat fire is in the middle, with a smoky heat filling the room. Now open your eyes, can you see the house as it used to be Finn opened his eyes and looked around.ldquoYes, I think so.ldquoCan you smell the peat smoke in your imagination ldquoI donrsquot know what it smells like aunty.ldquoItrsquos a sweet smoke.ldquoI smell it now.ldquoNow look up, can you see how the soot from the fire has made the rafters of the roof all black ldquoYeah, itrsquos all sooty.ldquoWe are sitting in the very place of the story, said Izzy. ldquoRight where you are, sat Rob Roy himself.ldquoNo aunty, hersquos next to me, otherwise hersquoll be on my knee, joked Finn.ldquoAll right then, of course, hersquos next to you, chuckled his aunt.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"work-progressing-400-home-development-longniddry","story":"Work at the site ndash being marketed as lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo ndash has been ongoing for more than a year.The East Coast Main Line railway is all that separates the new development from the existing Longniddry settlement.But the site of the new homes is actually where lsquooldrsquo Longniddry once stood, hence its lsquoLongniddry Villagersquo name.This week, ZeroC, part of Places for People, opened the doors to its new show home in the development.Longniddry Village is being developed in partnership with landowners Wemyss and March Estates.Maps dating back to the s show that half of the old village of Longniddry was to the south of where the railway now runs, on the site of the present Longniddry Farm.When John Glassell acquired most of the lands of the village in , the pace of change increased and many of the remaining houses and buildings in the village were cleared for agriculture.The railway arrived in  and land previously owned by Mr Glassell was passed firstly to the House of Argyll and then to the Wemyss and March Estates, with the many new homes being built to the north of the railway line in the s.Allison Sutherland, regional sales and marketing director for Places for People in Scotland, said: ldquoItrsquos been an exciting time for Places for People to deliver our first ZeroC development in East Lothian, which delivers a fresh approach to building homes in the area.

So, with Secrets Of The Whales, it was really about bringing people into the lives of these whales.Are humans and whales more similar than we think Weve often been very clinical and how we view wildle - we see ourselves apart from it or above it. Butwe begin to understand that whales have personality, they give each other names, they isolate by dialect, they have singing competitions, they have food preferences, they mourn their dead, they do all of these things that used to be thought of as only the domain of humans but are not so. So, were sharing this planet with this alien intellectual species that does things much like we do.Is there anything that might surprise viewers So, in the place whereare catching sea lion pups, Patagonia, theyre the only orca in the world that do that. The orca in New Zealand are eating stingrays and the ones in the Norwegian Arctic are eating herring. So, its this ethnic food preferences, international cuisine, that makes that culture.How did Avatar director James Cameron become involved in the project I knew Jim - we had met several times over the years, I think there was a bit of mutual respect I certainly had great admiration for his genius and his work. He is a National Geographic Explorer... Hes a master storyteller. He can create everything from fictional characters and scenes and sets and story narratives, he can invent the equipment thats needed to film it in D and do things that havent been done before. But hes also a pioneering ocean explorer who, you know, builds his own submarines and goes to the deepest part of the ocean to understand.And you managed to get Alien and Avatar actress Sigourney Weaver involved Bringing in Sigourney Weaver as the narrator was fantastic. I always thought that would have been fantastic because that female voice, especially for these whales, that are often led by females, was brilliant. So yeah, on every level, it was sort of organic.At one point, we see you intervene and help a trapped orca do you ever worry about upsetting the natural balance of the oceans How can humans play their part in helping save the oceans We have to realise that all of our actions have consequences. That we dont live on this planet in a vacuum, that we are intricately connected to nature and everything we do matters. Were dumping  billion pounds of plastic every year into the ocean, and weve lost % of the big fish in the ocean post-World War Two and weve lost half the worlds coral reefs... It can be as simple as finding better ways of fishing and not having vertical lines that animals get entangled in - and thats going to take some collaborative efforts. Or it could be just being better consumers, informed consumers, voting for people who care about conservation and science.Does the feeling of awe ever wear off when you interact with these ocean giants I mean, it never gets old -anything, its addictive. Ive been doing this for decades and every year I swear, it gets better. As a young boy, I had dreams and fantasies of doing this kind of thing and you have certain preconceived notions, but the reality ends up being better than those fantasies... You have to get the footage, but theres a scene in the sperm whale film where I put my camera down - Im playing with a six-month-old calf out in the middle of the ocean. And at some point, you just have to stop working and just soak it up.Secrets Of The Whales from National Geographic premieres on Earth Day, Thursday, on Disney+"},{"url":null,"title":"brian-taylor-nicola-sturgeon-offers-supporters-paradise-deferred","story":"OK, she did not name her putative opponent.And she made plain she was not remotely interested. Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"election-2021-lobbygate-independence-better-uks-pirate-republic","story":"Mr Winton, now sadly departed, was the flamboyant presenter of Supermarket Sweep, one of the most subversive shows in Britainrsquos formidable daytime television canon.

He had a wicked glint in his eye and something too that hinted at sadnessThe format was simple and brutally insurgent. Each day, friend-and-family couplets would compete to race around a supermarket filling their trolleys with as many goods as possible within the allotted time of one minute.

They too know that as soon as they access ministerial powers the clock begins to tick on their opportunity to grab all that they can before the voters next have a chance to remove them.By then, hopefully, theyrsquoll have made enough connections and granted a sufficiency of favours to ensure that their path back into civilisation will be eased with a few non execs and advising merchant banks how to move their money around the globe unimpeded.Is it possible that there may be a Tory politician out there who isnrsquot seeking to use his position to enrich himself  This party, in these days, has succeeded in fulfilling the greatest dreams of aice of every Tory whorsquos ever gone before. Theyrsquove re-tuned the political consciousness of Middle England.Once there was an assumption, even amongst the most cynical of us, that after overweening ambition and self-aggrandisement politicians still retained a desire deep within their beings to serve the public. Now, it seems the public and our public institutions exist merely to serve the acquisitive whims of High Conservatism.Read more:Bonnie Prince Bob: Meet the indy star targeting the SNP in Edinburgh CentralYou wonderthere comes a point when Tory politicians must surely pause and reflect on whether or not their attempts to exploit their parliamentary privileges begin to gnaw at their own sense of self. David Cameron and his family are already rich beyond the imaginations of the overwhelming majority of voters in this country. Did he not feel just a little tawdry and humiliated as he went from minister to minister advisor to advisor, seeking favour for his billionaire clients  Perhaps his reported bonus of pound million carried him well past the point where self-esteem ceases to be a consideration.Was Health Secretary Matt Hancock so driven by a desire to wring every penny of financial leverage from his limited time in a great office of state that he didnrsquot consider his stake in a NHS-approved contractor to be immoral  Perhaps, having observed how ineffective Keir Starmerrsquos Labour opposition has been, they felt that the public were there for the taking without any consequences. After all their friends and colleagues who helped themselves to multi-million PPE contracts seem not to have encountered any backlash in the polls.Labour politicians in the Tony Blair era were slightly more circumspect in the process of capitalising on their time in office. Blair himself built a massive property portfolio while pimping himself out as a sort of international, travelling peace salesman. In office, Blair committed British troops to seven wars, all of which provided him with ample opportunity to make the connections in the Arab world that would provide a few extra zeroes in his pension. Since then his global consultancy providing peaceful solutions to stubborn conflicts has failed to reduce tension let alone avoid a war. Mr Blairrsquos relationship with peaceful outcomes is within the vegetarian smoked sausage supper interface.Read more:Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothIn Scotland, an assortment of senior Labour figures after building careers and affluent lestyles in the People sector duly progressed to the House of Lords.

All of it, for all of them, had been one giant exercise in swindling a constituency who had trusted them not always to get it right but at least to remain true to themselves and us.And then you look at the SNP with their fake radicalism and their own careerist chancers, chiselling their own constituency and keeping it stupefied on the independence teat.

Half own a stake in their co-operative and are eligible for pension payments, profit sharing and help to buy their own homes.According to Ted Howard: \"A job is not enough. For people to stay out of poverty they need to have assets.\"The irony is that councils, health boards and universities the world over would endorse this sentiment, whilst failing to use their considerable, combined, contractual clout to help achieve it. That changed in Cleveland where civic bodies dramatically changed their attitude to the criminal waste of millions of dollars flowing from the city every year in \"best value\" contracts awarded to massive, zero-hour contract-deploying companies headquartered where.Read more:Salmond: Indyref: Will the Alba Party help or hinder the cause of independence It was a mini civic revolution, which could happen in Scotland too,central government, councils, health boards, universities and quangos could operate together to extract better value from the billions they spend in our name every year through procurement processes that are currently stacked to suit massive outsourcing specialists like Serco ndash an outsourcing giant whose profits soared as its disastrous test-and-trace system recently collapsed.Of course, such a dramatic change from the old \"safe\" best value outlook, will inevitably create problems.Chief amongst them, the need to ditch the deep-seated belief that still persists amongst managers and professionals, that economies of scale are supremely important to achieve ndash no matter how disastrous the big company performance or how many capable, smaller, local firms ndash starved of public sector contracts ndash go to the wall.British governments have always agreed that big is beautul ndash in the shape of massive nationalised industries or equally large corporate players. But now the privatising zeal of Margaret Thatcher has combined with Boris Johnsonrsquos contracts for cronies, to make this size issue more extreme.There are a lot more contracts knocking about and theyrsquove grown steadily larger, more complex and consequently lie even further beyond the reach of local firms.Big is automatically seen as a guarantor of success ndash even though banks that were \"too big\" did fail and small countries, with ultra-local government and a highly developed instinct for self-reliance have been held up as exemplars during the pandemic.EU procurement rules have been blamedfor carving local suppliers out, since contracts over a certain size had to be advertised across the whole European Union. But councils were always allowed to select bids based on quality, risk, social value, food miles and other factors besides price.The proof of that pudding is Preston Council which used the Cleveland Model to double its spending with local businesses in the pre-Brexit period of -. It used a weighting system that scored local labour recruitment and skills training to award contracts to local firms. In  Preston was declared the most improved city in the UK, by an independent Demos report and the cityrsquos unemployment rate halved as local procurement spending rose in the five years to .In Scotland, innovative councils like Aberdeen have also awarded public contracts to local food producers by inserting food miles into their selection criteria whilst remaining ldquoEU compliant.Where therersquos a will therersquos a way.So, does the absence of a Scottish Cleveland or Preston suggest a lack of political will here Community Wealth Building made an appearance in the SNPrsquos programme for government last year prompting councils like Glasgow City to trial small, pilot projects. According to leader Susan Aitken, the council now intends to build on its experience and announce a city-wide Circular Economy Action Plan.This is the scale of ambition neededthe Covid recovery and Green transition ndash more empty buzzwords during this election campaign ndash are not to become disappointing missed opportunities.We lack the \"patient capital\" that allowed Cleveland to set about transforming itself. But with this election, Scotland has a political opportunity to radically change procurement policy so that our council tax millions invest in local people to deliver local services.We need pump-priming councils who think like local economic dynamos, so that what goes around in taxpayer cash, comes around in locally sourced jobs.And we need a new Holyrood Government willing to lead by example.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Small town big dreams.I gave up watching football years ago, partly out of revulsion at how it has become a playground for plutocrats, but mainly because its become pretty boring. Id rather watch the dads playing park football ndash theres a lot more goals for a start. So I was supremely indferent to the news that some English clubs with more money than sense had decided to join a breakaway European Super League. Better off without them.However, the mega-stushie in the beautul game has now taken on an unexpected political signicance. The future king has joined with the Prime Minister to condemn this European League of Greed. Boris Johnson has promised to blitz the ESL with ldquoa legislative bomb.Im not entirely sure the government can prevent these foreign-owned private businesses crossing continents, but never mind. This is a Red Wall issue. Sir Keir Starmer has also cried foul and called on the government to take back control, asthis were another dimension of Brexit. MACWHIRTER:Alba needs a U-turn after its car crash campaignThe European Super League has nothing whatever to do with the European Union, but it does with something underlying it: globalisation. It is part of the relentless march of capitalist expansion across national borders, leaving the little people behind. And there has been a hint of Brexit in the way commentators have condemned the mega clubs for betraying their country and community. Pundits on the left have been sounding like Nigel Farage wondering whatever happened to patriotism and loyalty to ones own.It is all about money, of course. The founding clubs will reportedly share pound billion courtesy of JP Morgan, which is one of the mega banks now financing Big Footie. This is to help them adjust to the rarefied atmosphere of global football, and is absolutely not intended as a bribe, or to buy the lads a drink. It is also to cover their vast debts.Fans and football governing bodies like UEFA are furious. The left-behind clubs stand to lose a heap of money by not being included in this European Super League. Politicians and football celebrities like Gary Lineker are attacking the breakaway clubs for disrespecting the fans and for polluting the Peoples Game with filthy lucre.There is, it has to be said, just a hint of hypocrisy in this outrage from wealthy ex-players and managers. British football is hardly a model of affordable community sport. The Premier league is all about money ndash mainly TV cash ndash which has been used to pay ludicrous sums to the primping prima donnas of the pitch. The main reason the sports personalities and clubs are worried now is that some of their money will be creamed off by the super leaguers.Defenders of the ESL say its just the way the game is going in the age of globalisation. They claim that many of the big clubs, far from minting it, are actually dicing with bankruptcy. This is partly because of Covid, but mainly because of the huge debts they have incurred trying to maintain their standing in the world and keep their fans happy. To survive, the top clubs need to cash in on that global status. Playing a wet Wednesday in Stoke doesnt make it.READMORE MACWHIRTER:Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe fans arent entirely innocent bystanders here. Theyve wanted success above all ndash silverware in the boardroom. To quote Bill Shankly: ldquoIf you are first youre firstyoure second youre nothing. To win nowadays is hugely expensive. Superstar Lionel Messis contract with FC Barcelona is worth over poundm a year. This may help explain why the world-famous club is in pound.bn in debt.Of course, theres a simple answer to that cash flow problem: just dont pay them. But that doesnt work in the global sports marketplace, apparently. From the point of view of clubs like Manchester United, who apparently have more fans in India than in England, it is all about giving their viewers what they want. It is no more objectionable, they say, than rock bands performing in mega stadiums on world tours. No one says the Rolling Stones are abandoning their fans and following the money.If people keep paying, the Super League will probably happen, sooner or later, whatever the politicians say. As for Scottish football ndash well, nothing to see here since no team in Scotland is remotely in contention. Which in many ways is a very good thing. Every few years there are rumours about Rangers and Celtic plotting to join the English Premier league on the grounds that they cant afford to continue in the small pond of Scottish football. But it never seems to happen.This could be an opportunity for Scottish football to go precisely the other way: become a sport which was more about local fellowship than global finance. Be more like the Jags. Partick Thistle is one of a small but growing number of Scottish clubs that are owned by their supporters. Mind you that was because of the generosity of the late Colin Weir, who essentially bought the club to give it to the fans. I doubtthe American Glazer family, who own Man U, will do likewise.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We have the drive, the knowledge, the skills and also the ambition.One area where we could improve, however, is education. Specically, our young people need to become enthused by, and engaged with, the ious opportunities technology offers.If they see exciting and worthwhile careers are available in tech and go on to fulfil these roles, it will build the critical talent pool required.Digital Xtra Fund is targeting exactly this goal. A Scotland-wide charity, it is increasing interest in computing and technology among those aged  and under by supporting extracurricular tech activities that inspire young people to follow this path.The Fund has been highly successful and continues to grow. It is winning new financial support and expanding its ambitions further to the point where it is now seriously contemplating a future where there is a tech club in every school or community in the country. ldquoWe have new partnerships in place and a new role within the Fund, says Kraig Brown, the Fundrsquos Partnerships and Development Manager. ldquoItrsquos all very positive.In a major boost, the Fund has most recently partnered with new Scottish tech investment company Chroma Ventures, which has donated pound,. This means when the Fundrsquos annual grants are announced in June, it will award pound, rather than the pound, originally announced.The charity is also hiring a Community and Grants Officer to help take it to the next level. This person will focus on fostering collaboration between industry and grant recipients.They will also help those receiving financial awards to understand concepts such as ethics in technology, how to use tech as a force for good, as well as the importance of meta-skills ndash skills to create, collaborate and empathise with others ndash alongside technical skills. Kraig Brown says the new role is part of a wider strategy to help industry enthuse youngsters about tech and develop their understanding of the digital world.ldquoWe want to get more professionals in front of young people talking about their careers. If young people can connect what theyrsquore learning to these jobs, it will help exponentially long-term.One example he gives occurred during a recent online session he attended at Heart of Midlothian FCrsquos Innovation Centre, a community-based initiative offering courses to help participants learn digital skills.ldquoThere was a User Experience Designer from Sky who was giving participants some really useful feedback on things like how their apprsquos buttons could stand out better and where the back button should be to make it more intuitive.ldquoI think these types of interactions are hugely valuable because it relates the learning to lsquoreal lersquo while also informing young people what a UX Designer does.This doesnrsquot happen enough, but this new role will encourage and facilitate more of these interactions and share examples of best practice.Kraig is also delighted with the additional funding provided by Chroma Ventures.ldquoIt made an immediate impact. It means we can now disburse pound, this year ndash thatrsquos fantastic. It also puts us back on track with where we were pre-Covid Irsquom proud of that too.This increased confidence is enabling the Fund to think more about how Scotland can become a global tech leader. Kraig would like Digital Xtra Fund to lead on developing a network of lsquoTechspacesrsquo for every school or community across the country. Modelled after Makerspaces ndash these would be informal learning spaces designed and dedicated to giving young people the opportunity to get creativewith tech.ldquoThey would be fun, safe spaces where children and young people could get hands-on and learn about tech. They could discover and explore at their own pace while trying out ious coding s or kit. The learning is informal, but educators and volunteers would provide lessons and structure just like all the other extracurricular activities we support. However, there isnrsquot the stress of a test or essay at the end which puts a lot of young people off trying computing when they get to Secondary.ldquoTechspaces would also operate outwith the curriculum meaning they would be flexible and could more easily involve industry volunteers. Non-curriculum programmes such as lsquodo your:bitrsquo from the Micro:bit Educational Foundation, iDEA Badges, or Apps for Good ndash which are proven to engage young people ndash could be easily incorporated as therersquod be no set curriculum. This would give participants opportunities to try new things and essentially play around without a fear of failure.This approach addresses several of the challenges facing Computer Science in schools. ldquoFirst and foremost, there arenrsquot enough Computer Science teachers in Secondary Schools and the ones who are in place have to keep an eye on the curriculum.ldquoAt the Primary level, teachers are already often at capacity so asking them to include more during class time isnrsquot always viable, not to mention the training involved. Evenwe overcame this, many schools donrsquot have the kit or budget and eventhey do, it is often restricted by firewalls set by the Council.ldquoWe need make the idea of playing with technology exciting and not stressful. This could be done in the classroom ndash there are some brilliant examples of this across Scotland ndash but there are many challenges doing it that way and we need to start winning young people over more quickly.Kraig is under no illusions the magnitude of this vision. With , schools in Scotland, it would require signicant investment. However, he does not believe this all should come from the Government either.ldquoDigital Xtra Fund has successfully brought industry and Government together to award pound, over the past five years. Yes, education is ultimately the responsibility of the Government, but it is industry that needs this to happen and will directly benefit from an increased talent pool. As such, we need to work together. I believe this is the easiest and quickest way to create a generation of inventors and innovators to make Scotland a global leader in the digital economy.www.digitalxtrafund.scot--------------------------------------Scots entrepreneurs share fundrsquos aim to inspire youngstersTHERE is no doubt that the Digital Xtra Fundrsquos vision of digital learning is a highly challenging and ambitious one. But Kraig Brown believes in thinking big. His mantra is thatthere is a will, there is a way.Bringing Chroma Ventures on board is undoubtedly a big step forward. The company was established in Scotland earlier this year by entrepreneurs Paddy Burns and Chris van der Kuyl.Pictured left, Paddy Burns, Chris van der Kuyl and Gavin Anderson of tech investment firm Chroma VenturesIt is the investment arm of J Studios, the multiple award winning video games company best known for developing Minecraft for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo games consoles.It shares the fundrsquos ethos that inspiring young people to understand and to create with technology is essential to the future well-being of Scotland.The donation is one of the biggest the charity has received to this date.As part of the companyrsquos new commitment to the fund its Principal Paddy Burns, who is also Chief Executive of J Studios, will now join as a trustee, bringing new thinking and strengthening the charityrsquos entrepreneurial credentials.Kraig Brown says that he is delighted about the tie-up. ldquoLike many charities,  was full of uncertainty for us.ldquoThis support from Chroma Ventures has enabled us to continue supporting educators and young people at the same level as previous years. At a time when many in the third sector are struggling, this is important as it builds confidence among our grant recipients, stakeholders and other industry partners that we will consistently support talent in Scotlandrsquos tech sector.And Paddy Burns comments: ldquoTechnology is a thread that runs through my own back story and the sort of initiatives delivered by Digital Xtra Fund resonated strongly. I firmly believe that improving digital skills throughout Scotland can lead to le changing opportunities for young people across the country.Article in association with Digital Xtra Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"janey-godley-tory-sleaze-back-like-s-club-7-rebooted","story":"David Cameron is in the news, apparently, a lobbying sleaze has erupted after it was discovered he texted the chancellor Rishi Sunak on behalf of Greensill Capital.Turns out Cameron also lobbied the NHS on behalf of the company as soon as the pandemic hit.

They were so friendly with previous residents that they buckled the fence as they leaned over, obliging their owners to replace it. Nor were they discriminating in who they would allow to feed them. They liked anyone who could increase their calorie intake. When chewing wood palled and they went in search of a proper snack, they would knock the lid off our neighboursrsquo compost bins, the racket alerting them to their needs.Not knowing much about horses, I didnrsquot initially know that they were Eriskays. This is a rare breed that, by the s, was endangered to the point of extinction. Originally Hebridean islanders, these squat, muscular beasts were packhorses, bred to carry creels and undertake long, arduous journeys. They are descended from the Pictish horses that were ridden by our medieval forebears, including, I recently read, Robert the Bruce. Given their sweet nature, it is unpleasant to think of them being whipped into the battlefield fray.Those were the days when, in the equine world, small was good. On a visit some months before lockdown to Huntly Castle in Aberdeenshire, I was struck by the size of the stalls in what was left of the original stables. Barely large enough for a modern motorbike, they suggest these creatures must have been petite. Pity the one that was picked to carry the gluttonous Earl of Huntly, who rivalled Henry VIII for girth. It is said that he once had hurriedly to escape the castle through a window to escape capture by Mary, Queen of Scotsrsquo men. An image of the camel and the needlersquos eye comes to mind.In Hoolet, and hereabouts, soldiers, posses and reiver gangs of that era rode not on Eriskays but on similarly small, sturdy breeds. Prized for their stamina and strength, they were known as lsquohobbiesrsquo. No matterthe thugsrsquo feet were almost dragging on the ground as they raced from one pillaging to the next, so long as their steed covered the ground swtly. In that respect, some reivers must have resembled young urban drug dealers today, wheeling through the streets on bikes so undersized, their knees are under their chins.One of the most interesting buildings in our nearby district is at Crichton Castle, in Midlothian. The castle has its own historical and architectural fascination but its main interest, to my mind, is that it is home to one of the finest stables in the country. At first sight yoursquod think it was a chapel. Built in red sandstone, with two storeys, a pointed roof and crow-step gabling, this is where the castlersquos soldiers kept their mounts. Ostlers would probably have slept on the upper floor, among the straw. Nothing says more about the importance of horses in this period than the magnicence of this building. You can picture the riders saddling up, strapping on their swords and heading off in a cloud of dust, like something from Americarsquos wild west. Which, thanks in no small part to the capabilities of their horses, areas of Scotland once closely resembled.A year or more ago, to my regret, the Eriskays left the field behind us. Much as I liked the sheep that replaced them, they were no substitute. The placid, whiskery grey mare, who Irsquom told produced many beautul foals, had reached the end of her le after more than  years. Her companion, the stumpier, peppery, brown gelding, was relocated to a field near the burn. There, evenhe is out of sight, you can sometimes hear him shoving empty plastic buckets, on the hunt for food. I miss his intelligent gaze and rough - often muddy ndash coat, more waterproof than a Barbour jacket. Whenever I stroked him, Irsquod breathe in the unbeatable smell of horse. If it could be bottled and used as an air freshener, it would bring the best of the countryside indoors.Seeing him all alone in his new home I felt sorry for him. Then, one frosty morning, when I was walking down the brae, an unfamiliar horse poked its head over the wall, aslooking for a chat. It was another Eriskay, also brown, with a mane cropped so short it was almost punk. Despite the breed being recommended for children as a docile ride, I later heard its rider chastising it for nipping her. It reminded me of a school friend who, as an eight-year-old, had her own Shetland pony. She arrived one day and lted her t-shirt to show her round midrf, which bore the perfect imprint of a full set of horse teeth. Although Thelwell did his best to endear these four-legged barrels to the nation, I was never fond of them. All those I encountered, including the biter, could be tetchy. These days, a Clydesdale would be my idea of a perfect ride: slow and stately, with a back so broad that, once in the saddle, yoursquod feel enthroned.You can scarcely drive a mile in these parts without passing grazing horses, or riders, going at a clip as they head for open country. Some are bred for the racecourse or the hunt, but as many are enjoyed simply for hacking, without any competitive end in sight. Down here they are a way of le, not a status symbol or accessory. Itrsquos a demanding responsibility, absorbing hours of every day. Yet without them, the Borders would be unrecognisable, and forlorn. As would Hoolet. Italian towns have church bells to punctuate the hours here we go by the clatter of hooves."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-question-time-tonight","story":"The leaders of all Holyrood parties bar the SNP have agreed to take part in Thursdayrsquos show, which will feature questions from a virtual audience.Heres everything you need to know.Who is taking part in BBC Question Time Leaders and co-leaders will be taking part as part of the  with Scottish Labour being represented by Anas Sarwar, Douglas Ross of the Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater, and the Scottish Lib Dems leader Willie Rennie taking part.

Yes, we have seen new policies to tackle poverty, but poverty has continued to rise and we have not had a coordinated approach, the leadership, at national or local level to end the need for food banks.ldquoFood bank parcels have only ever been a proxy for poverty levels.

But not with your boss, evenyour boss is the First Minister of Scotland. If my boss tried to sleepy cuddle me Irsquod be straight to Human Resources and hersquod probably be on his way to the hospital.Yet that is one of the things we know Alex Salmond did with a colleague during his time as leader of this country.The married -year-old also says he had consensual sex with a colleague, and stroked anotherrsquos face while she was sleeping, apparently to try and ldquowake her up.The reason I point this out is because it is something Mr Salmond wants desperately to get away from ndash and which some journalists are more than happy to oblige.Sure, Channel  news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy gave him a grilling on the day he launched his new political party, March , and my own colleague Tom Gordon did similar ndash askinghe was still a creep and bully, orhe had reformed.But those questions, fielded by predominantly male political journalists, have dwindled somewhat.Alongside this, Mr Salmond has become more aggressive in his responsesanyone dare ask him why he is fit to stand for political office. It follows a pattern: he repeats that he has gone through ldquotwo court trials, three inquiries and was cleared before berating the journalist for ldquotrying to re-try him.There is one problem with his approach. How are the electorate meant to judge his suitabilityhe will not address the elephant in the room  Thatrsquos why the questions, no matter how bullish and rude the responses, should not stop coming.This hasnrsquot always happened because histo politics has injected excitement into what would, until his arrival, have been a relatively boring election campaign.His behaviour, which surely would have seen him forced to resign had he been in office when it became public, is being slowly brushed aside.After all, it isnrsquot like there arenrsquot other things to report on when it comes to the Alba Party. Many of their online events have been plagued by technical dficulties, which has left Salmond standing in front of a microphone like a bingo caller while his helpers try to fix the internet connection, making a joke, or possibly a new policy idea, about improving the broadband in Scotland.When asked in one recent interview with Sky Newsrsquo Adam Boulton about his conduct with women the former FM trotted out his usual answer: ldquoI like the way you wave away the trialshellip A trial in front of a jury in which I was acquitted. A jury, incidentally, with a majority of women on it, in front of a lady judge. He went on: ldquoI think most fair minded people will say lsquoThatrsquos that, itrsquos time to move onrsquo. I donrsquotthink Sky Television should be trying to retry me.Mr Salmond may want to move on, which is all well and good, except being acquitted in a criminal trial does not explain away non-criminal behaviour.His defence was centred around the former first ministerrsquos assertion that his conduct, while indecent, was not criminal. That was, he has always insisted, a line he never crossed.But there is a line between the criminal and the indecent and that is where Mr Salmond owes the electorate an explanation.How are voters expected to decidehe is fit toto Holyroodhe wonrsquot address these questions  How will women in Holyrood feel about his past behaviour This is not about the Alba Party, let me be clear about that. Diversity in politics is good, and some have suggested a move like this has been on the cards for while.With the SNP being such a broad church, and its only truly unying goal being independence, it makes sense that other issues such as the gender recognition act reform, or even how to achieve independence, would begin to split the party. Those who have joined Alba are seeking a new way of achieving independence and have strong views on womenrsquos rights which they believe are being eroded by attempts to reform the gender recognition act.These are important issues they should be discussed.It is also entirely legitimate for those candidates to seek a better political home for their views.The problem is that Salmond is its leader, and some of its supporters already know this presents dficulties. Albarsquos policies on womenrsquos rights may be taken far more seriouslythis were not the case.Particularly so as Mr Salmond appears to be using the support of women in his new party as a proxy an attempt to show that there is no problem with his behaviour of the past.When it was pointed out to him recently that ldquosome people are a little bit dubious about your record with women, he instantly replied: ldquoClearly some of the strongest feminist voices in Scottish politics are not, otherwise they wouldnrsquot be our party candidates.The problem is, womenrsquos concerns about gender recognition and the behaviour of one man, who was the most powerful man in Scotland at one point, are very dferent issues.If Mr Salmond truly wanted to show he cared about womenrsquos rights and safety, he should look at his own past behaviour and start answering the questions. Instead he is hiding behind female juries, lady judges and female politicians."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12531970.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-miss-majority-holyrood-election-support-scottish-independence-dips-latest-polls-show","story":"The Savanta ComRes survey for The Scotsman predictedthat the party will MSPs in total ndash two short of a majority ndash the same number as in .However there would still be a pro-independence majority at Holyrood, with the Scottish Greens forecast toeight MSPs, two more than , and the party predicted to secure % of the list vote in .Only % of voters said they plan to vote for Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party, which would leave it without a single MSP elected.The poll projects that the SNP willa constituency vote of % and a list vote of % in the May  election.It predicts that the Scottish Conservatives will achieve % of the constituency vote and % of the regional list, which would see it MSPs ndash one more than in .Scottish Labour is forecast to% on the constituency and % on the list vote and is predicted to MSPs, three fewer than in .The Scottish Liberal Democrats are predicted tofive MSPs, the same number as in , with % of the constituency and % of the list vote.The poll of , Scottish adults also found that support for Scottish independence is split, though support for No has increased since a survey at the start of April.The latest poll found that % would vote No in an independence referendum, while % would vote Yes, with the remainder undecided.When ldquodonrsquot knows are excluded, % support No and % said they would vote Yes.A survey at the start of April found thatan independence referendum was to be held tomorrow, % would vote Yes and the same proportion No, with the remainder undecided.The latest poll was carried out between April  and .Meanwhile, support for Scottish independence is at itslowest level since over a year, according toYouGov research forThe Times.The poll found that  per cent of voters want Scotland to be an independent country, not including undecided voters.In early March, when YouGovlastasked the questions, support was two percentage points higher.Support of % represents the least support for independence since December .When all voters are included,  per cent said they would vote ldquono and  per cent ldquoyes in a referendum askingScotland should become an independent country.Meanwhile, ten per cent of voters were undecided, fourper cent would not vote and twoper cent refused to disclose their intentions.The research also reported \"pushback\" against the plansfrom Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond to focus on independence soon after the Holyrood election next month.Only  per cent of voters said they thought there should be another ballot onSturgeonrsquos timetable, with  per cent opposed.However, there was more support for a referendum being held in the next five years, with  per cent in favour,  per cent opposed and  per cent unsure.Ms Sturgeon has previouslyconfirmed she will be seeking another referendum before the end of .Mr Salmond has said he would demand that independence negotiations with Whitehall begin immediately.He has repeatedly criticised the SNPs lack of action on the matter of independence.It comes as The Scottish Trades Union Congressvoted yesterday to back another independence referenduma majority of MSPs are in favour of the move after May  ndash but it stressed the immediate priority is recovering from the pandemic.The announcement is the result of a vote at the bodyrsquos annual meeting, which concluded it is for the Scottish Parliament to decide when oranother referendum should be held.But the union bosses rejected attempts to gain a supermajority of MSPs in favour of independence by the Alba Party by using what it calls ldquotactical manoeuvring, fearing it may undermine the sovereignty of voters as Scotland remains broadly split on the question of independence.STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: ldquoOur vote today has reaffirmed the right of the Scottish people to self-determination and recognised that as the central democratic institution in Scotland, our Parliament should have the power to determine whether and when to hold a second referendum.ldquoBut we have also asserted that economic and social recovery is our priority, and that radical policy is needed to achieve that in a way that redresses current imbalances of power and wealth. We will hold to account all parties of all political colours who take their eye off that ball.Ms Foyer also said any second vote would not have to be a straight choice between independence and remaining in the UKa ldquomeaningful third option is developed.Since before the  referendum, some have said the possibility of ldquodevolution max should be explored, where Scotland remains part of the UK but is given substantially more powers than are currently held at Holyrood, with only major portfolios such as defence reserved to Westminster."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-retired-teachers-help-close-attainment-gap","story":"Poverty and educational inequality have co-existed for a long time. I started teaching at the age of  in a Fe mining community, where deprivation stared me in the face. I came across one wee girl whose attendance at school was very erratic.When I questioned her, she tearfully explained that she could not manage to school every day because she had to share a pair of shoes with her brother. The ldquoshoes were a pair of leaky welly boots.My sister came to the rescue with some second-hand shoes, which led to an immediate improvement in attendance and attainment.There were great hopes and expectations that the comprehensive revolution of the s would narrow the attainment gap. When he was Secretary of State for Scotland, Willie Ross introduced comprehensive education without even the need for an Act of Parliament. He simply sent out a circular to all local authorities telling them to abolish selection and fee-paying in all state schools.Such radical measures certainly helped, yet here we are, over half a century later, still talking about the need to narrow the attainment gap.It would be wrong, of course, to confuse equality of attainment with equality of opportunity.The former is unachievable but the latter is both achievable and desirable. What, then, can be done to improve the attainment of pupils from deprived areas First of all, extra resources must be concentrated on those who are most in need. Smaller class sizes, homework clubs and the provision of home internet connection would help, but I have always believed that the most valuable educational resource is a good teacher and sometimes good teaching requires one-to-one communication, especially for pupils who experience dficulties.An increasing number of parents seem to be paying for extra private tuition for their children but many parents on low incomes simply cannot afford the additional cost. The inevitable result is a widening of the attainment gap.The Scottish Government should intervene by organising and paying for the recruitment of a pool of unemployed and retired teachers who are willing to give a few hoursrsquo or even one hour per weekrsquos tuition to young people from deprived home backgrounds.Most retired teachers understandably want to enjoy their retirement but there may be some with time on their hands who would be very capable of giving one-to-one tuition, possibly in the comfort their own home, when Covid restrictions are eased.At the start of the current pandemic, retired NHS staff were asked to consider helping out. The same pandemic threatens to widen even further the educational attainment gap, with long-term devastating consequences for a whole generation of deprived young people. Would enough retired teachers respond to the challenge An imaginative recruitment campaign is worth a try.Dennis Canavan, Bannockburn.Taking children out of povertyIT is, of course, entirely John Milnersquos choice as to how he will vote in May , but I find it strange that he has placed his trust in Anas Sarwar to alleviate child poverty, as Mr Sarwar, by his own admission, wonrsquot be in power after Mayrsquos election, and has his sights set on coming second.Given the wide-ranging proposals put forward by someone who does have her sights set on winning the election and lting children out of poverty, with such mechanisms as doubling the new and unique to Scotland Child Benefit, providing free breakfasts and lunches for all primary school children, and laptops or tablets for all school pupils, with a wrap-around system of childcare free to low-income families, I would suggest that the best route to take children out of poverty would be for Mr Milne to give both his votes to the SNP.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Defending the indefensibleMAYBE Bob MacDougallis stretching credibility to suggest that, in an independent Scotland, shipyards couldnrsquot contract for overseas orders. Here are some equally bizarre extrapolations of my own: the remaining , or so BAE systems workers throughout the UK making these frigates could have been made millionaires for half the cost of the frigates so far.The frigates in turn are being built to help protect two new aircraft carriers the UK can only ever use in distant offensive actions ndash assuming, that is, that the UK can ever afford enough planes of its own to fly from them to make the circumstances viable. The F- Lightning planes cost pound million a pop and are so expensive to run that the US, which makes them, are considering scrapping the . trillion project and designing a new plane.To sum up: Westminster is building frigates to defend horrendously expensive aircraft carriers that may soon become redundant. Perhaps an independent Scotland may be better at husbanding its financial resources.David J Crawford, Glasgow.A parting of the ways THE one thing that Scotland appears to be a world leader in is poverty.Not only do we have serious issues such as child and fuel poverty, but with the recent revelation that one in seven Scottish adults apparently suffers from ldquodata poverty there is yet another ldquopoverty to add to the ever-expanding list along with ldquonature, ldquohygiene, ldquoexercise, ldquospiritual and ldquoculture in Scotland.Personally, I suffer from ldquohair poverty. How do I get a Scottish Government grant for this David Bone, Girvan.Guarantee of EU membershipSCOTLAND is, and always has been, a relatively poor country.The one action which rescued Scotland from its third-world status was the Act of Union with England in  to form the United Kingdom, a union which has proved to be immensely profitable for both Scotland and England.The disaster that is Brexit shows only too clearly the perils of setting up more boundaries between countries, as Britain has done with its former principal trading partner, Europe. For Scotland to commit a similar act of folly with its principal trading partner, England, would be catastrophic. The so-called answer proposed by the SNP is for Scotland, as a separate country, to jointhe EU.Apart from the fact that Scotland would have far less freedom as a member of the EU than it has as a devolved part of the UK, there is the serious question of whether Scotland would be accepted as a member of the EU.Scotland has a much larger capital debt than is allowed under EU rules, and its membership would have to be approved by all of the existing members of the EU. This includes countries such as Spain, which already has its own independence problem with the province of Catalonia, which is unlikely to make it sympathetic to Scotlandrsquos cause.It would be madness to hold a referendum on Scottish independence until the Scottish Government has obtained an unqualied guarantee from the whole of the EU that Scotland, on becoming independent, would be accepted as a full member of the Union, and on what terms.The alternative of independence outside the EU and outside all other trading blocks, with nocurrency and no international bank, is suicidal.Finally, it must not be forgotten that the Westminster Government can be voted out of office at not more than five-year intervals, while the break-up of the UK would be permanent and irreversible.James Cormie, Perth.Look abroad for neutral chairmanNEIL Mackaywrites that Nigel Boardman, selected by Boris Johnson to head the inquiry, has links to a private bank which has links to the Tory party.Whether this will skew the outcome remains to be seen. In view of the need to have the inquiry headed by a neutral chairman, would it not be better to get a lawyer from Australia, Canada or New Zealand to head it  Andnot, why not George Smith, Clydebank.Who believes Boris now ALTHOUGH briefly a briefing room, the million-pound makeover of Number  Downing Street tells us a great deal about the Prime Minister.He takes up fancies with great enthusiasm and trumpet-blowing then quickly drops them when he tires of them or they become inconvenient or embarrassing or are revealed as vain folly.Even on the day of debriefing the briefing room he was at it again, impetuously announcing that all measures would be taken to prevent the proposed football European Super League and that he would legislate against it.The league seems to have fallen apart faster than his promise, of course.

anextensive range of mechanical and engineering works have taken place - but with the castle going back on the market, its now up to the future owner to complete the project.Carbisdale Castle was built between  and  for Mary Caroline, Duchess of Sutherland, the second we of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, rd Duke of Sutherland.The Duchess was better known as Duchess Blair, however, due to her first marriage to Captain Arthur Kindersely Blair of the st Highland Light Infantry, who died in a hunting accident in  near Pitlochry.Her marriage in  was not well received by the Sutherland family, and following the death of theDuke in  his will - which was in favour of the Duchess -was contested by his son, the th Duke.A court process followed, finding the Duchess guilty of destroying documents in attempt of securing the inheritance.She was imprisoned for six weeks in Holloway Prison, London.Eventually, the Sutherland family came to an agreement giving Duchess Blair a substantial financial settlement - as well as agreeing to build her a castle.The Duchess employed a firm of Ayrshire builders and got to work building Carbisdale Castle in .Because of the close location of the castle to her late husbands family, it was thought it was her deliberate attempt to spite the family.This is further supported by the fact the castles tower only features clocks on three of its four faces.The side facing Sutherland is blank,allegedly because the Duchess \"did not wish to give the time of day to her late husbands family.\"The castle was later bought by Colonel Theodore Salvesen, a wealthy Scottish businessman of Norwegian extractionin .He provided the castle as a safe refuge for King Haakon VII of Norway and Crown Prince Olav, who would become King Olav V, during the Nazi occupation of Norway in World War II.During that time, the castle was also used to hold important strategic meetings.King Haakon VII made an agreement at the Carbisdale Conference on  June  that the Russian forces, should they enter Norwegian territory, would not stay there after the war.Three years later, on  October , the Red Army entered Norway and captured  towns, but later withdrew according to the terms of the agreement.After the Colonel died his son, Captain Harold Salvesen, inherited the castle and gave its contents and estate to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association .Carbisdale Castle Youth Hostel opened to members on  June .The castle remained in the ownership of the SYHA until the costs of owning and maintaining the buildings and its contents became untenable and the castle was offered for sale, being purchased in  by its current owner.Amid a project toit to its former glory as a private residence, works have begun.However it will now be up to the lucky purchaser to complete the project \"in accordance with their own specications and intended future use of the property.\"Robert McCulloch, Head of Estates and Farms Agency in Scotland at Strutt  Parker said: \"Carbisdale Castle is an iconic building with really rich and notable history.\"The property today can be viewed as a lsquoblank canvasrsquo of almost , square feet of internal accommodation enabling a buyer to take the property in whatever direction they prefer.\"That could be as a private home, a commercial venture , or a mixture of both, subject to the appropriate consents. \"With the combination of uplt in interest in Scottish rural residential properties from UK buyers and across the globe since the onset of the pandemic together with rising demand for domestic holiday accommodation and facilities, its exciting to be able to bring a property as remarkable as Carbisdale Castle to the market.\"The flexibility of its future use together with its striking architecture and dramatic position will undoubtedly attract global interest.\"What remains to be seen ndash and will be interesting to discover ndash is whether the buildingrsquos future lies as a private home for the exclusive use of its

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

given the coronavirus jab at University Hospital Coventry.In a Zoom call with NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens, the grandmother of four was asked what she would say to anyone feeling hesitant about getting a second jab.Mrs Keenan replied: ldquoI would be saying lsquogo and get it, and get it nowrsquo.ldquoBecause itthe best thing theyrsquove ever done, really.the best thing I ever did.

anything.Asked about how she felt being the first to have the jab, she added: ldquoI feel really honoured to have it done and to be the first and set the ball rolling.Mrs Keenan said that, having since had her second dose, she was now most looking forward to ldquoa little holiday, adding with a laugh ldquoIrsquom not greedy!The nonagenarian, who only retired from her job working in a jewellerrsquos four years ago, also praised NHS doctors and nurses for their work during the rollout.She said: ldquoTheyrsquore incredible, I cannot find words to say hellip they are really incredible

called back.Anyone aged  and over can still arrange their jab, as well as people who are clinically vulnerable or a health and care worker, who should contact their GP for an appointment.The NHS is also inviting those eligible for a jab by letter and text, with some GPs also calling unvaccinated patients personally to encourage uptake.Doctors, nurses and other health care workers are

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy.

He thought the landscape idea would be fitting.“We were thinking of locations and the Storr is quite an obvious one.

Back in the mid-s, Ronnie was among the youngest recipients of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Gold Award. Ronnie, who was orginally from Thomas Street was a member of the army cadet force in Ballymena. When the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme was introduced, the ACF, like many youth organisations, embraced the concept wholeheartedly.Ronnie, who now lives at Deerfin Fold in Harryville, was one of many cadets who strove for the coveted ‘gold award’ and thanks tohis efforts he was invited to the awards ceremony in Edinburgh. But it turns out that Ronnie not only scored a gold success, he did so at the tender age of !Apparently, he was so keen to sign up for the cadets his instructor had added two years to his age so he could join, thus he may well be one of the youngest Gold winners in the history of the hugely challenging awards programme.

The committee is made up to two representatives from the communities of Portglenone, Grange, Hillstown, Cloney, Cullybackey and Tullygarley. With the support of both Mid  East Antrim Council and the Lottery Community Fund, we have continued to work with our local communities in a number of dferent ways.As part of an ongoing  year project funded by the Lottery Community Fund, BMW have been organising Zoom classes, one-to-one training, Samsung tablet loan scheme and monthly postal cards and gts. Zoom classes are held every two weeks and topics have included Gardening, Cooking and Craft. Joanne Brown Kerr, Development Officer, commented: “Over the next few weeks we look forward to enjoying some fantastic old film footage through NI Digital Archives, learn how to be Energy Efficient and enjoy some music, fun and quizzes. “These are all free of charge and open to anyone living in the above or surrounding areas.“The Samsung Galaxy Loan Scheme involves providing a device to someone who would like to take part in Zoom and learn more about using the Internet to reduce feelings of isolation. “We have loaned out all  tablets and provided one to one training either over the phone or in a safe and social distanced manner. “For those in our databasewe send an update via letter each month along with a card and gt. Some examples of gts have been herb seeds, teabags, notebooks and other small food items.Joanne Brown Kerr, Development Officer, commented: “It has been amazing to see how the Zoom classes have grown in numbers over previous months and how we are all getting used to a new way of doing things! “ The feedback from recipients about both Zoom classes and the monthly letters has been overwhelming and we hope to continue to do this until restrictions lt.“The BMW team have also been working on a ‘Year to Remember’ book, made up of stories, poems, illustrations and recipes which will remind us of our experiences – both good and bad – of this pandemic. We look forward to launching this in the coming weeks.Another project BMW are working on is a fantastic online resource of information relating to those who were involved in WW from our local areas.  This is the next stage of an ongoing WW project following the successful production and launch of a fantastic WW book called ‘Remembering’.If you would like to find out more about any of the projects mentioned above, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with Joanne by phone on    or email admin@bannmainewest.

It has worked to date.

We’re not anywhere near that level where localised restrictions would need to be brought in to manage a greater threat, but it is about asking the people to use those basic steps that have worked for us in the past.Mr Swann said vaccine centres may be set up in specic areas where there is a spike in cases.Patricia Donnelly, who heads up the local vaccination programme, said a number of pilot schemes were under development which will see pop-up vaccination clinics in workplaces, sports facilities and community centres in towns such as Ballymena, Cookstown and Coleraine in the next week or two.She added officials were planning to target areas of deprivation and areas where the uptake of the flu vaccine and public health screening programmes are traditionally low.We have always saidyou can bring the vaccine closer to people, they are more likely to take itthey are even slightly hesitant, she explained.Many motivated people who go to the vaccination centres will travel distances to get their vaccine, but for those who are a little bit more doubtful, we have to provide more locally accessible .It also emerged during the briefing that it is likely the Moderna vaccine will be offered to younger cohorts as an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.However, Ms Donnelly revealed it would not be available in Northern Ireland until June.She warned: We have very modest amounts coming, which creates a dficulty, so you can’t really depend on it, but we are likely to use it with the younger age group when it arrives.Read MoreNearly % of NI#s over s have received first Covid vaccine doseCommenting on the possibility of Covid- certicates, suggested by the First Minister last week, Mr Swann said he was not comfortable with the idea of forcing people to use them to access hospitality or close-contact services.He added he was keen that work be carried out to see how useful they would be in relation to large-scale gatherings where social distancing is not possible.He also admitted they may be needed for international travel.Northern Ireland recorded one Covid-related death and  positive cases yesterday.There were  Covid- inpatients, nine of whom were in intensive care.There is just one active Covid outbreak in local care homes.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cc-b-fe-d-effe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cc-b-fe-d-effe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ac .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cc-b-fe-d-effe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Comment PremiumDr Gabriel ScallyOpinionIt#s excellent that NI’s testing and tracing is being improved, but playing catch-up is never a good approachFrom today, in Northern Ireland, you will be asked to take a test and self-isolateyou’ve been identied at high risk of developing Covid-.

Completely contrary to this, however, you’ll find in the council’s written evidence a detailed log of no less than eight engagements between council and PSNI during this period,” he told MLAs.Council chief executive Anne Donaghy told MLAs of multiple incidents of “sinister and threatening graffiti” from mid January which included the message that “all border post staff are targets”.“There was increasing information from political representatives, contacts at grassroots and staff that suggested tensions were rising, this included reports that Crimestoppers had been informed of a number of iniduals at the port were being targeted,” she told MLAs.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_afa-f-bf-d-de_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_afa-f-bf-d-de_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_afa-f-bf-d-de_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_afa-f-bf-d-de_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PSNI cars outside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs offices near the Port of Larne PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePSNI cars outside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs offices near the Port of Larne Ms Donaghy said there was also a report that a DAERA staff member had been followed home from work and sinister graffiti had appeared near their home.She also said there were reports from staff of “intimidating behaviour at the ports, including an increase in stationary and slowing vehicles observed at the port and the suspected recording of car number plates details”.“Video footage of cars taken at Larne Port also appeared on social media,” she said.Ms Donaghy criticised “mixed messages and a lack of reassurance from the local PSNI”.She said there was an increased presence of police at Larne Port, with , standard hours and  overtime hours dedicated to the area.“In total, council had to ask for the written assurance on five separate occasions, two of which had to be escalated to the office of the chief constable as we were keen toour staff safely to the Port of Larne as soon as possible,” she said.PAMost ReadMagheramorne Estate mansion transformed into wedding venue with  jobs createdMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIBridgerton star Rege-Jean Page arrives in Belfast to film Dungeons and DragonsStormont moves to protect famous Belfast street signsMagherafelt man charged with drink driving after recording highest ever alcohol reading in Northern IrelandTop VideosPlay#A complete mess#: builder leaves couple with badly finished bathroomPlayVideo: GARC thug threatens Sunday Le journalist during Ardoyne parade protestPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car Latest Northern IrelandGrandmother, , who had Pfizer jab first urges people to get second Covid doseBBC commissions new series The Fast And The FarmerStormont department’s secret dealings with engineering firm distorted level playing field, court rulesNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Latest delays and ersionsLatestWest Ham join Max Aarons suitors as full-back gears up for Norwich exitEddie Hearn says Anthony Joshua’s bout with Tyson Fury is ‘as done as it can be’Paul Merson stresses importance of speaking up about depression and addictionApology over failure to honour black and Asian troops who died for EmpireRussia holds major drills in Crimea amid Ukraine tensions,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Tourism is worth roughly €mto the Bundoran economy annually, welcoming hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.Sinn Fein councillor Michael McMahon, a former mayor of the town, said visitors are always welcome to the town.It#s not our intention to turn people away from Bundoran, he said.We depend very much on Northern Irish tourism because we#re in very close proximity to the border.They have been the bread and butter in Bundoran for decades. Mr McMahon said the roll-out of the vaccine will allow the town to safely welcome holidaymakers in the coming months.The vast majority of the people in the six counties are vaccinated so they are no threat.If they#re doing the right things - keeping two metres apart and keeping a safe distance - then I don#t see any harm in that.Mr McMahon said that with the absence of international travel, the town will be more dependent on visitors doing staycations again this summer.I want to see tourists coming to Bundoran and I want to see people getting back to some sort of a normality.I want to see restaurants, arcades and hotels opening, he added.Local tourists descended on the town in record numbers last summer when restrictions were lted, with many choosing Bundoran as their staycation destination, giving a massive boost to the local economy.Tourism officer for Bundoran Shane Smyth said the pandemic has caused an increase in visitors to the town.We have always had a big historic connection to Bundoran with people from the North, he said.They were the backbone of the visitor population to the town for decades and centuries.It was only last year then that we started to get more people from the southern counties that were traveling to Donegal for the first time and that was great to see, he said.Belfast Most ReadMagheramorne Estate mansion transformed into wedding venue with  jobs createdMixed feelings in Bundoran over influx of people from NIBridgerton star Rege-Jean Page arrives in Belfast to film Dungeons and DragonsStormont moves to protect famous Belfast street signsMagherafelt man charged with drink driving after recording highest ever alcohol reading in Northern IrelandTop VideosPlay#A complete mess#: builder leaves couple with badly finished bathroomPlayVideo: GARC thug threatens Sunday Le journalist during Ardoyne parade protestPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car Latest Northern IrelandBrexit disruption to NI medicine supply lines would be unacceptable – ministerGrandmother, , who had Pfizer jab first urges people to get second Covid doseBBC commissions new series The Fast And The FarmerStormont department’s secret dealings with engineering firm distorted level playing field, court rulesMayor stands by decision to withdraw staff from check duties at portsLatestLindsay expecting to receive huge response from Cltonville to get European dream back on trackSir Alex Ferguson: I cried tears of joy when Scotland qualied for Euro Dominic Raab insists cuts to aid budget announced in ‘fully transparent way’US pledge to halve emissions by  moves world closer to climate targetFilming begins for th series of Call The Midwe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He added: Whilst the investigation is at an early stage, a strong line of inquiry is that this attack is the work of the New IRA.This was an explosive device designed to create a fireball. That fireball would have engulfed the car, anyone in it and in the proximity.First Minister Arlene Foster said yesterday dissident republican groups were currently attempting to attract new members in the north west and in her own Fermanagh-South Tyrone constituency.I do want to absolutely condemn the actions of these people, the DUP leader told the BBC.My local representatives in that area, and unfortunately in my own area, have watched as dissident republicans are seemingly trying to recruit at present.I say to all young people who may get caught up in the midst of this: think what could have happened to that young woman and her very young child and think of the consequences of that.Following a meeting of the Policing Board#s resources committee, Sinn Fein#s Gerry Kelly said members wished to record their abhorrence at the attack on this mother and her family, and welcome the strong messages of support and condemnation voiced across the community and from all political parties.He added the committee meeting had focused on the new PSNI People Strategy and plans to move forward with a range of recruitment competitions for officers and staff.

If approved an additional  plots will be created at the local graveyard. For many years concerns have been raised that the City Cemetery has been running out of burial space. Derry City and Strabane District Council, which manages the cemetery, have lodged a planning application in recent days for the extension proposals. The Derry News has seen confidential documents from a special meeting of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee held on Tuesday to discuss the plans. googletag.cmd.push A report was presented to councillors detailing plans to expand the existing City Cemetery on to adjoining lands at Southway. The plans include a new road into the cemetery off the lower end of the Southway road .  It has also emerged that a portion of the lands could be made available for social housing. Council officers estimate that the expansion will cost pound.m. The earmarked wooded area is presently owned by the Northern Ireland Housing Executivewhich leases it to the Woodland Trust. Council officers previously explored the possibility of expanding it in two parts. An initial assessment indicated that , additional plots could be accommodated. googletag.cmd.push The larger part of the works were to be sited on the high ground below Kildrum Gardens where , plots would have been situated. The smaller area on low land opposite Lone Moor Gardens – where the new entrance will be made – was to accommodate  plots. However, as detailed plans were drawn up it emerged that the lower site was unsuitable because of engineering costs and the inability to meet inclusive standards for pathways. Furthermore, the document states that the number of plots that could be accommodated would be signicantly reduced by site works and drainage systems and the presence of red squirrels and badgers may have led to planning issues.     Development of the lower cemetery site opposite Lone Moor Gardens was therefore ruled out. But for health and safety reasons officers recommended approving the new access road. According to the report, the approved upper Kildrum site will have space for approximately  plots. It could extend the lespan of the existing cemetery for between five and seven years, dependent on future burial rates, it adds. Local residents were assured that the new access road will provide around  parking spaces for residents or visitors. Council officers also attempted to assuage the concerns around fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour which have caused problems for residents in the past. NEW SITE Part of the rationale behind the expansion is to allow the local council to find a suitable site for a new cemetery. Since the late s the local council has been reviewing the lespan of the cemetery and as such decided to research potential new sites. It sought expressions of interest from landowners who were willing to sell land on two occasions during  but nobody came forward. A third advertisement in  generated four expressions of interest at Coney Road in Culmore, lands adjoining the old Killea Cemetery, lands at Nixon’s Corner and near Braehead Road. The preferred site at Killea was ruled out as the cost was deemed too high. Lands close to Nixon’s Corner are now viewed as the most realistic option. When asked to confirm that approval was granted and plans for a new cemetery site, a spokesperson for Derry City  Strabane District Council said: “The meeting was held in confidential due to the commercially sensitive nature of the discussions however the recommendations from the meeting have to come before Full Council for ratication next week and we will be in a position to provide more info at this point.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club had been invigorated at the turn of the Millennium and in the - season they had narrowly missed out on the league title. Hearts and minds were already looking to future progress on the field, but a sudden council decision was to plunge the club into uncertainty, inadvertently removing that field. “In late s and early s all first team games were played at Meadowbank as it suited intermediate football rules,” said former first team coach Robert Rainey. “The Magherafelt council CEO John McLaughlin called a meeting with chairman Glenn Robinson, secretary Brian Rocks and myself to explain the new creation of Meadowbank sports arena. googletag.cmd.push “The team, having examined the council plan, observed that it did not comply with intermediate football rules.” The clubs original mini-soccer center back in . The decision left the club in an awkward spot. Strict conditions had to be met for the Sky Blues to continue to compete at intermediate level and they were about to be rendered homeless. There were limited options within the council area for leasing pitches that would meet the leagues rules, but a solution was found less than a mile from Meadowbank. “At the monthly Sky Blues meeting it was agreed to ask the council to rent out a pitch in Magherafelt known as Stoney Park,” said Robert Rainey. googletag.cmd.push “This pitch was a nightmare to the council as it was open ground and very hard to maintain, so the council agreed to this request from us and a lease was agreed.” An agreed -year lease on the land marked the first step on a challenging journey to creating a facility fit for a club with ever-growing ambitions. The playing surface at Stoney Park lived up to its name and was hard and unforgiving. The clubs plans included the resanding and drainage of the entire area. Work at Spires Park in  ahead of the clubs new committee room and kitchen.     The development would also include an exterior and interior fence, a new two-team changing facility, showers and a separate referees changing room. Consultation with local residents proved just one of a number of hurdles the club had to navigate in getting their plans through. They enlisted local MLA Patsy McGlone to help with their application, and at a make-or-break planning meeting in Ballymena, their plans were approved. With the area acquired by the club known as Stoney Park, the club felt a rebranding was in order and officials convened in a snooker room connected to Anthony Campbells house in Magherafelt. Amid lively discussion, Martin Kerr proposed the facilitys name be changed to Spires Park, a reference to the distinctive spires of the towns three main churches. Linfield played at official opening of Spires back in  pictured was club captain Gareth Cassidy. The committee concurred, and Kerrs canny name change banished many club members memories of the dficult playing surface in one fell swoop. By the summer of , the fencing, painting and decorating had all been completed, in time to allow the Sky Blues to commence the   season in their shiny new home. The changing rooms and referees facility were next on the to-do list, and as the club continued to grow, further upgrades were required. “We knew Magherafelt and the South Derry area was a hot bed of footballing talent,” said former Chairperson Glenn Robinson. “All we had to do was put the hard work into securing Spires, and we knew the club would thrive. The decision by the council had forced the committee to think big picture and long term. “To our delight, we leased Spires Park, redeveloped it, and during the worst recession in living memory, secured and repaid the finance required to do it.” The development of he facilities took a further step under the leadership of Chairperson Brian Surgenor. Office cabins, a small kitchen, disabled access toilet and large meeting space were among the progress, as well as a new storage shed and ball stops at the leisure centre end. With a top class facility in place, the clubs volunteers put their shoulders to the while in maintaining the Sky Blues focal point in the area. BBC came to town last year to interview all the local clubs in relation to Covid-, Thomas Niblock is pictured with Club Chairman Gerry Kelly. Glenn Robinson highlighted the importance of Spires Park in securing the clubs status as an important piece of County Derrys footballing tapestry. “The decision to move to Spires has catapulted Sky Blues as an important football brand and club not only in South Derry but also Northern Ireland,” he said. “Since  thousands of young and old players have used the facility and everyone from the original committee back then to the current one should be congratulated for the work they have put into this. “Football is the beautul game and Spires Park has given so many players in this area a chance to enjoy the game we all love. “Everyone linked with this club should be proud of what they are doing to provide these opportunities.” Last week, the thud of colliding leather echoed around Spires Park as collective training resumed. The excited cries of young and not-so-young players. Yelps of celebration. The sounds of football are back and through years of hard work, the Sky Blues have built an arena fit to welcome them.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was very generous to me and gave me a couple of hours work experience in the office and it kind of went from there. Unfortunately David passed away in  and he left my name with the electoral office to become the MLA for East Londonderry, so thats where it came from.  LT: How did that feel when someone like David McClarty, who you looked up to, left your name as his successor  googletag.cmd.push CS: I had mixed emotions around it. David was a wonderful man and the community really got behind him after that happened. It was a huge honour when, after his passing, he had given me that role. Equally, it was daunting and I didnt have him there to guide me and mentor me through it. I always wonder what he would have made of the last seven years with me as his successor. I hope Ive made him proud.  LT: You mentioned about helping people. What has been your most proud achievement in that sense  CS: Prior to me becoming Minister, despite having over , incidents of domestic abuse across Northern Ireland every year, no one had ever tackled it. googletag.cmd.push I made it my mission that we would get a conversation started around it, and that led to the piece of legislation that my successor has been able to make into law now. If this all ended tomorrow, thats what I would take away from it.  LT: Did it frustrate you how your time as Justice Minister came to an end with the Assembly unravelling  CS: It was disappointing, because I feel that government of Sinn Feacutein, DUP and myself was one that had the opportunity to transform Northern Ireland. Certainly the conversations we were having around the Executive table before it all fell apart were the most positive, I understand, ever.     We had created a new approach in Northern Ireland where we were looking at outcomes. I really hope people start to realise what our job is, and vote for people on that basis.  LT: It had been rumoured at the time you had considered quitting politics. How close were you to doing that  CS:  was probably the worst because I really did think wed moved on, and it made me reconsiderit was something I wanted to continue in. Ive had those feelings even since then, because we had three horric years where politicians in particular parties were not being responsible to the people who voted for them. The only reason I continue to do this job is to help people and try and progress things for them, andI cant do that it would make me consider whether it was worth it. Its my job to help people, and most people are really kind and generous. Thats what I focus on and what keeps me going.  LT: Over the last while there has been violence and protests in the area. How do you try and calm the situation as a local MLA  CS: I watched the behaviour unfold and its sad to see it does seem to be young people. They are being exploited by potentially more sinister elements within the community. Kids will look for opportunities, andthey arent there, and someone  is providing them in the form of paramilitarism, that might be a better option for them. Its no coincidence the unrest is happening in socially deprived areas and we need to get back to building them up again and not allowing paramilitaries to manipulate them. Recent violence in Coleraine. LT: How important are independent voices in Northern Ireland politics  CS: Often people would criticise me and ask what one MLA in  do, but in my seven years as MLA I have demonstrated I have had an impact. There is almost something more honest about independents, andwe need more of anything in politics at the minute, its honesty. I dont have to refer my opinion to someone, I can just have a very considered approach myself. If anyone compliments me, they say they appreciate my honesty and candour.  LT: Youve mentioned female voices. Three of the current party leaders are women. How would you assess the current position  CS: The Assembly needs to be representative of the people of Northern Ireland, so% of the population are women, then we need to have % of MLAs as women as well. The Assembly, in fairness, has come great strides in terms of that representation, because we have more female MLAs than weve ever had. But we need more, and I would encourage any women, particularly young women, who are thinking about this to consider getting involved and having a voice. It probably means them joining a party, but be the change you want to see.  LT: Is there anything in particular youre hoping to see done in the remainder of the Assembly term  CS: Im working on a piece of legislation around trauma. Its a fact of le, whether its a car accident or have a traumatic birthing experience. Mainly in Northern Ireland, our trauma comes from the conflict, and we have this generation in their s and s now who were traumatised by conflict and weve never dealt with that. Were now seeing that manesting in mental health issues, and its no coincidence we have some of the most signicant mental health issues across these islands. I would like to develop a piece of policy or legislation that stops people being re-traumatised. I think it opens up that conversation about how we address the conflict.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was very generous to me and gave me a couple of hours work experience in the office and it kind of went from there. Unfortunately David passed away in  and he left my name with the electoral office to become the MLA for East Londonderry, so thats where it came from.  LT: How did that feel when someone like David McClarty, who you looked up to, left your name as his successor  googletag.cmd.push CS: I had mixed emotions around it. David was a wonderful man and the community really got behind him after that happened. It was a huge honour when, after his passing, he had given me that role. Equally, it was daunting and I didnt have him there to guide me and mentor me through it. I always wonder what he would have made of the last seven years with me as his successor. I hope Ive made him proud.  LT: You mentioned about helping people. What has been your most proud achievement in that sense  CS: Prior to me becoming Minister, despite having over , incidents of domestic abuse across Northern Ireland every year, no one had ever tackled it. googletag.cmd.push I made it my mission that we would get a conversation started around it, and that led to the piece of legislation that my successor has been able to make into law now. If this all ended tomorrow, thats what I would take away from it.  LT: Did it frustrate you how your time as Justice Minister came to an end with the Assembly unravelling  CS: It was disappointing, because I feel that government of Sinn Feacutein, DUP and myself was one that had the opportunity to transform Northern Ireland. Certainly the conversations we were having around the Executive table before it all fell apart were the most positive, I understand, ever.     We had created a new approach in Northern Ireland where we were looking at outcomes. I really hope people start to realise what our job is, and vote for people on that basis.  LT: It had been rumoured at the time you had considered quitting politics. How close were you to doing that  CS:  was probably the worst because I really did think wed moved on, and it made me reconsiderit was something I wanted to continue in. Ive had those feelings even since then, because we had three horric years where politicians in particular parties were not being responsible to the people who voted for them. The only reason I continue to do this job is to help people and try and progress things for them, andI cant do that it would make me consider whether it was worth it. Its my job to help people, and most people are really kind and generous. Thats what I focus on and what keeps me going.  LT: Over the last while there has been violence and protests in the area. How do you try and calm the situation as a local MLA  CS: I watched the behaviour unfold and its sad to see it does seem to be young people. They are being exploited by potentially more sinister elements within the community. Kids will look for opportunities, andthey arent there, and someone  is providing them in the form of paramilitarism, that might be a better option for them. Its no coincidence the unrest is happening in socially deprived areas and we need to get back to building them up again and not allowing paramilitaries to manipulate them. Recent violence in Coleraine. LT: How important are independent voices in Northern Ireland politics  CS: Often people would criticise me and ask what one MLA in  do, but in my seven years as MLA I have demonstrated I have had an impact. There is almost something more honest about independents, andwe need more of anything in politics at the minute, its honesty. I dont have to refer my opinion to someone, I can just have a very considered approach myself. If anyone compliments me, they say they appreciate my honesty and candour.  LT: Youve mentioned female voices. Three of the current party leaders are women. How would you assess the current position  CS: The Assembly needs to be representative of the people of Northern Ireland, so% of the population are women, then we need to have % of MLAs as women as well. The Assembly, in fairness, has come great strides in terms of that representation, because we have more female MLAs than weve ever had. But we need more, and I would encourage any women, particularly young women, who are thinking about this to consider getting involved and having a voice. It probably means them joining a party, but be the change you want to see.  LT: Is there anything in particular youre hoping to see done in the remainder of the Assembly term  CS: Im working on a piece of legislation around trauma. Its a fact of le, whether its a car accident or have a traumatic birthing experience. Mainly in Northern Ireland, our trauma comes from the conflict, and we have this generation in their s and s now who were traumatised by conflict and weve never dealt with that. Were now seeing that manesting in mental health issues, and its no coincidence we have some of the most signicant mental health issues across these islands. I would like to develop a piece of policy or legislation that stops people being re-traumatised. I think it opens up that conversation about how we address the conflict.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Applications were recently made for new Irish street signs at Ballynagard Crescent and Hatmore Park. Once an application is made to Derry City and Strabane District Council, the council then writes to the residents in the streets to find out their views on the street sign application. From those who reply to the councils correspondence, a minimum of % of respondents must support the new street sign proposal for it to be granted. In January of this year, the council agreed to reduce this threshold to %. googletag.cmd.push However, the applications for new street signs at Ballynagard Crescent and Hatmore Park were all based on the previous threshold. In relation to Ballynagard Crescent, a total of  households were contacted in relation to the application. Of these households,  responded to the council and % of them were in support of the new street sign being erected. However, because this did not meet the current threshold of %, the proposed new road sign will not be installed. At Hatmore Park,  households were contacted by the council. Forty responses were received and % of the Hatmore Park households who responded were in support of the new street sign, with % opposed to it. googletag.cmd.push As a result, a new Irish street sign will be erected in the street. Januarys decision by the council to reduce the bilingual street sign threshold from % to % was criticised by unionist councillors. They described it as a backwards step for cross community relations in the local area. However, those who backed the decision said it would promote equality within local communities.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The appointment process for those in the age bracket is due to open at the end of April, but limited appointments are now available, mainly at the vaccine centre in the SSE Arena, Belfast.     Health Minister Robin Swann said those eligible should seize the opportunity. “Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you,” he said.  “I would also strongly encourage anyone aged  years or over who hasn’t booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible. “I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by JCVI .” “Opening up to - year olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Drumrane PS Burnfoot, St Canices PS Feeny and St Matthews PS Drumsurn will all receive new signage. The move has been welcomed by local UUP representative Robert Carmichael. “Our children’s safety is paramount and should always be at the forefront of our minds,” he said. Alison Steen, principal of Drumrane PS, said the new limits would make existing initiatives at the school even safer. “The staff and I fully welcome the new speed limit outside school - it will make exiting on to the main road safer for our parents in their cars and also for families using the buses and taxis,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “We are part of the Sustrans project and encourage families to park a little further away and walk into the school grounds. “We also encourage the older children to cycle to school and run the cycling proficiency scheme every year. The mph speed limit will make these initiatives safer and we hope that they will become more popular. “Lots of families cross the road when they park at the local shop and the lessening of the speed limit will also lower the risk of an accident in the village,” she added. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Responding to an Assembly Question from Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsMinister Edwin Poots said officials were seeking approval from the Department of Finance. I fully recognise the pressures faced by the Lough Neagh fishing industry as a result of the Covid- pandemic, he said. I have had to consider closely complexities relating to the eligibility criteria for a scheme while balancing the need for an inclusive approach. I have now directed my officials on how I wish to proceed with a support scheme to alleviate the financial impacts of the pandemic on commercial fishermen licensed to fish on Lough Neagh. googletag.cmd.push My officials are liaising with the Department of Finance to seek approval to proceed with the scheme. Patsy McGlone MLA has welcomed the progress, but said there is no justication for its delay. It is not clear what changes the Minister has made to the scheme since the Assembly Committee was told previously that it had been cleared by the Departmental Solicitors Office and by the Department of Finance, he said. I have raised this issue with the AERA Minister and departmental officials repeatedly in the Assembly and Committee over a number of months.  There is no justication for theof time it has taken to finalise the scheme. People were promised that this support would be provided last summer. googletag.cmd.push “Many of those fishing families are on relatively low incomes, and they need that support. “It is now up to the Finance Minister to respond promptly and authorise the revised scheme, so that the financial support that has been promised to this sector can finally be delivered.” Mid Ulster councillor Niall McAleer has also welcomed the progress made on the scheme. It is welcome news that a financial support scheme has been confirmed today that will finally see some much needed cash being put into the pockets of local fishermen, he said. Despite the fact that the DAERA Minister Edwin Poots has repeatedly said, as far back as last August, that support would be put in place soon, it has taken over a year since the start of the COVID- pandemic to put this scheme in place, which is unacceptable.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moneymore Nursery Unit was founded in  in partnership with St Patricks Primary School, the areas Catholic maintained primary school, and the controlled Moneymore Primary School. However, in , the nursery unit removed St Patricks PS from its original admissions criteria, a move parents claim which makes it more dficult for children hoping to attend St Patricks to access local nursery provision. Terry ONeill, who had three of his children denied a place in the nursery due to the criteria, says agreement had been reached in  for the nursery to reflect a cross-community ethos. googletag.cmd.push “Moneymores play group was originally in the Catholic parish hall,” he said. “When it was moved up to the Protestant ground, it was agreed to have a dferent unorm, crest and entrance into the nursery. It meant it felt more neutral.” The Moneymore man has contacted the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young Peoplefor assistance. In correspondence with NICCY, seen by the County Derry Post, the Education Authoritysaid the nurserys current admissions criteria is at odds with its original intent. “The Education Authorityacknowledges your observation that the original purported intent of Moneymore Nursery School i.e. integrated provider of education in Moneymore appears inconsistent with the current schools admissions criteria, and this has been the case since   academic year,” they said. googletag.cmd.push “As you will be a aware legislative responsibility for determining admissions criteria rests with eachinidual school Board of Governors and is outwith the responsibility of EA. “Consequently EA has no role in establishing or amending inidual schools’ admissions criteriaand neither does EA have the legislative authority to challenge an inidual schools’ admissions criteria.” A response from Moneymore Nursery Unit is also included within the correspondence, where the unit say they have always been connected to Moneymore PS. “Moneymore Nursery Unit has always been a unit connected to Moneymore Primary School,” they said. “The criteria for the Nursery Unit are reviewed annually and in most years amendments are made.     “The Nursery Unit is often oversubscribed so the governors take account of a number of factors when reviewing and amending the criteria.” The primary schools are paired for the Shared Education programme and interact under activities related to it. Northern Irelands Childrens Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma said the current situation allows schools to drt from their original mission and that government should instruct, rather than advise, Boards of Governors. “School Admissions Policy, across Northern Ireland, is an issue which we monitor on an ongoing basis,” she said. “I am concerned, as Board of Governors ultimately have responsibility to set these in their respective schools, that many schools ‘drt’ from their original mission. “That is why we must reform when the Department of Education ‘instructs’ rather than ‘advises’ Boards of Governors. “I will continue to recommend the Department moves to instruct Boards of Governors in unorm policies, relationship and sexual education, restrictive practices and of course admissions policies. “The importance of the latter has been demonstrated by the recent challenges posed by the transfer test.” The County Derry Post contacted Moneymore Nursery Unit for further comment, but did not receive a reply.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock.

He and his we, Agnes, began to hold services in Downpatrick and surrounding neighbourhood, preaching, holding society meetings and administering the sacraments.He went on to build a Methodist preaching house in the town, personally raising funds, obtaining a suitable site and even joining in manual labour to ensure its completion.He conducted the opening service on November , , at Scotch Street and he and his family moved into an adjoining small room, which for many years afterwards served to accommodate preachers appointed to the town.It was decided in  to replace the original building with a new one on the same site. The result was the present building which was opened in April  at a cost of pound,.The congregation at the time decided to use chairs rather than pews in their new worship centre so that the building could be used for youth work and other activities during the week.In , the congregation completed an extension to the building in the form of a new kitchen and toilet facilities as well as a large upper room for youth work and other community activities. The cost of was pound, all of which was met by the local congregation.Whilst the Methodist congregation in Downpatrick has always been relatively small it has nevertheless made enormous contributions to religious, civil, and civic le in the town and surrounding area.There are strong ecumenical relations dating back to its inception as a church body. The congregation has endeavoured to work alongside denominations and the church was used as a refreshment point on the annual St Patrickrsquos Day pilgrimage from Saul to Down Cathedral where pilgrims were treated to a potted history of Methodism by Dr Brian Turner.The congregation also hosted well renowned annual lectures by visiting speakers including Baroness Blood and the distinguished author and journalist Alf McCreary, among others. In more recent years the dwindling congregation began to consider its future as part of the Dundrum, Newcastle and Downpatrick Methodist Circuit.All three congregations have suffered losses over the last two decades and it was time to consider how the Methodist community in southeast Down might look in the future.In January of  following several discussions with all three congregations the Circuit Council took the dficult decision to close Downpatrick and Dundrum Methodist Churches and consolidate as one congregation under the new name of Donard Methodist Church which meets in the Newcastle Methodist Church building.The Rev Mervyn Ewing, circuit minister, said: ldquoClosing a church is a huge and dficult decision to make which members of the Circuit Council did not make lightly.ldquoIt is important to note the considerable sacrices that were made over the years by the Downpatrick people who were committed and devoted to God, one another and their church.ldquoWe are very conscious of the emotional cost this decision has exacted on the devoted congregation. As Christians we believe firmly in resurrection for something new to grow and flourish there must be death.ldquoAs Methodists, building on all that has been before and what we have learned from one another and God, we forge ahead believing that in the lsquoNew Thingrsquo God creates there will be le and energy to stay true to our Methodist calling.Since the present Downpatrick Methodist Church was opened in  the ministers in charge have been as follows:, John McCaffrey, BA , John Hart , William E.

I watched the tall athletic figureballs with a hard bat, as they were known, while most in the club were playing with the new sponge covered weapons. I immediately decided that was the type of style and bat I wanted to play with.It was an exciting time in the club for young hopefuls eager to impress the boss, Leslie Sullivan, and get a place in of the three teams competing in the league. When I was eventually told that I would be playing in the A team away to St Maryrsquos, Newcastle, and partnering Noel in the doubles I was so excited that I practiced every night in preparation for the match which we won and then had to thumb a lt home.It was the start of a long tournament doubles partnership. We may not have been the most successful mdash our styles were too similar for that mdash but we certainly made the opposition work for every point.By the late s reverse bats, as they were known, were now the preferred option for most players, but Noelrsquos long range chopped defence suited the pimpled bat known as the lsquoBarnarsquo, named after  times world champion Victor Barna, and the perfect foil toto loop drives created by the new sponge revolution.The matches between Noel and his attacking opponents were a joy to watch and earned him the nickname Chopper. But soon new defensive products arrived, making Noel an even a more dficult player to contend with and resulted in him winning inidual trophies.Opponents who had played him previously knew what to expect and those who didnrsquot soon realised that they had to earn every point as the ball kept coming back mixed with the occasional well-judged forehand kill. All his matches were the same mdash succeed or fail, no quarter asked for and certainly none given.Noel Breen leaves behind a legacy of loyalty and dedication to the sport of table tennis.Always among the first to enter the leaguersquos charity events, he gave up his time to coach the Downpatrick Special Olympics team to compete in the league and helped other clubs in the district when they needed players.But it was at the Strangford club where he started and ended a long and distinguished service as a player and committee member. Whenever he was needed he was always available. He put up tables for competitions, made iders to separate tables and even secured sponsorship from local businesses to pay for the materials.A few years ago he told me he was advised to retire due to health issues. But following a short rest period he ed to support the club due to falling membership. Once a table tennis player always a table tennis player.His passing leaves another void in the golden years of the Lecale League. His affable personality endeared him to all who knew him, as evidenced by the numerous comments posted on social media sites following the news of his death.One especially from Martin Pickles is worthy of mention. He posted that Noel was a great competitor and played a good game of table tennis mdash high praise indeed from the master of defence, and a perfect epitaph to conclude this tribute to my good friend and mentor. Thanks for the memories and the craic Chopper.With deepest sympathy to his we Mary, daughters Noeleen and Carol, son Paul and family circle.By Jim Ritchie, secretary of the Lecale Table Tennis League and chairman of Strangford Table Tennis Club..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21April2021-Three.jpg","title":"Three year wait for new bypass  ","story":"WORK on Ballynahinchrsquos new multi-million pound bypass may not be completed until the spring of  at the earliest.The news has been confirmed this week by the Department for Infrastructure which has revealed that work on the eagerly-awaited scheme is not expected to start for another  months.Construction work on the largest ever road scheme proposed for the district mdash which could cost up to poundm mdash is expected to take an additional  months to complete,funding is made available.The update on the proposed schemersquos timetable comes after Stormont roads minister Nichola Mallon confirmed on Monday that she intends to make a so-called direction order for the near two-mile bypass linking the Newcastle and Belfast roads.Direction orders designate theof proposed road schemes with the roads minister reaffirmingher commitment to the delivery of the Ballynahinch proposal when funding becomes available.The bypass is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, with a number of politicians seeking confirmation that money for the scheme will be allocated.They are also demanding to know when construction work will start given the importance of the scheme to address chronic traffic congestion and help revive the market townrsquos economic fortunes.Speculation had been mounting that work on the eagerly-awaited scheme could potentially begin sometime this year given that the project is shovel ready. However, that is not going to happen given the update provided by the government department last night.The roads minister said the important project will deliver a bypass that will ldquosignicantly reduce traffic in the centre of Ballynahinch and improve journey time reliability and safety on the main Belfast to Newcastle Road.In addition to making a direction order, Mrs Mallon has confirmed that her department is currently exploring further opportunities to improve Ballynahinch town centre to create a ldquosustainable, liveable place where people have the space to stay, meet, shop and safely walk, wheel and cycle.She explained this will include opportunities for active and sustainable travel in the town including a new footway cycleway and a park and share facility along the route of the bypass.ldquoWe have a real opportunity to seize this chance for change and build back better together for our local communities, the roads minister declared. ldquoAs Minister, Irsquom committed to making progress in Ballynahinch and right across the North.ldquoThis is a positive step forward for the local community who have waited many years for progress on the Ballynahinch bypass and moving forward with it is part of my plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.Confirmation of the direction order comes after roads officials released a computer generated image on the Department for Infrastructure website which provides an aerial fly-through of the new road scheme, beginning at the Newcastle Road end.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Roads officials insist that the Ballynahinch scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety, while politicians urging the roads minister to confirm an early start date for the eagerly-awaited scheme are confident that it can play a key role in the economic regeneration of the market town.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said last night: ldquoIt is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement and a further  months to construct the scheme subject to funding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21April2021-Young.jpg","title":"Young Irish dancers make a return to toe tapping action  ","story":"THE easing of restrictions afforded dancers from then locally-based Brennan Miskelly McCormick School of Irish Dancing toto outdoor classes last week.The school, which normally hosts classes in Downpatrick, Crossgar, Teconnaught and Castlewellan, was delighted to get back in action following five months of lockdown and online zoom classes.The week culminated in a presentation of certicates to the dancers who competed at an online feis run by An Comhairle Uladh.The school entered  dancers in this first ever online feis.

Relationships between the two at the helm are an insult to the electorate. Crucial decision-making is mired in hopeless procrastination.Angry words, whether they are over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Covid regulations, attendance at funerals or lockdown rules, pollute the political atmosphere. At a time when people from all backgrounds want clear-sighted direction, we get fudge, indecision, superficial strategic planning and costly mistakes.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The vast middle ground of Northern Ireland voters demand better. They want an end to grand-standing and would dearly like to see some maturity from The Executive Office. Demands from the DUP and the UUP for the head of the Chief Constable Simon Byrne was, in the view of many across our society, a scandalous politicisation of law and order. Despite denials to the contrary, thoughtless ramping up the rhetoric over the Protocol and the Storey funeral fiasco has directly contributed to recent scenes of street violence, sectarianism and confrontation.I deplore the mentally bankrupt attitude of Arlene Foster and of Steve Aiken in respect of the PSNI and the Chief Constable. That is not to ignore the ratcheting up of tensions by the words uttered by Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney, Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long.To predict ato terrorist violence that we worked so hard to bring to a close in  is grossly irresponsible, insensitive and wrong. Sane, sensible negotiations to make an Irish Sea Border or a hard border on this island unnecessary could have been achievedwe had seen some sensible contributions from Dublin and Westminster leadership. Instead, we got scare-mongering and shrill exchanges.Hundreds of thousands of people want nothing more than an end to sectarian friction and yearn for normality. I fully understand their disappointment and anger. As a unionist, I now fear they will register their disgust in next May’s Assembly election by staying at home.That would not be an answer but most of our frustrated voters want an end to mere sectarian headcounts.They want our leaders to behave like responsible adults and not petulant youngsters.We need to ‘call time’ on what passes for politics in Northern Ireland, and begin to think collaboratively and constructively to resolve real issues for families and our present pandemic-damaged economy. The age of the political ‘kindergarten’ needs to give way to grown-up politics that puts the needs of all our people first and foremost.We cannot go on limping from crisis to crisis. Overall, our politics are being undermined and I have to hope that the handbrake will be applied before democracy itself becomes the casualty.North and South of the border, the electorate took big decisions for all the right reasons in ’.Now, that same ‘can-do’ and confident spirit is needed to end the awful political incompetence. • Baron Maginnis of Drumglassis a former UUP MP, who became an independent Lord in Lord Morrow: A more conciliatory Irish approach is needed to end tensionsClick here – Mike Nesbitt: ‘Conversion therapy debate shows why we can’t have unionist unity’Click here – Nolan’s patience tested by SDLP man: ‘I’ve asked you  times’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Mr Drakeford added: ldquoOn behalf of the Welsh Government and those supporting the government in this parliament, which was another huge development during his letime, I extend our sincerest sympathies at the end of an exceptional le lived.:Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said Philip had ldquooffered so much to so many people including through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or the serving and former members of the Armed Forces.ldquoHis own military service saw him play a key role in the struggles of World War Two, and he never forgot the men and women he served with and the countless thousands who followed, Mr Davies said.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ldquoWe are here not only to grieve but also to thank Prince Philip for his letimersquos contribution.ldquoItrsquos not a title or status or crown that is Prince Philiprsquos most important legacy that we celebrate today but the support that he provided to others.The Duke of Edinburgh last visited the Senedd while accompanying the Queen to the opening of the fth session of the-then National Assembly for Wales in .Campaigning for the May  Senedd election was postponed over the weekend following Philiprsquos death, but was set to resume for all parties following Mondayrsquos recalled parliament plenary. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
