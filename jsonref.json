But we still need your votesThe Not the Booker prize is back – for the 11th time. We’ve been uncovering excellent novels for more than a decade, and that’s a mighty fine thing. But let’s not dwell on the past, because the future promises yet more excitement. Like many 11-year-olds, the Not the Booker is changing.We still want to find this year’s best novels and uncover a few gems that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. We still want to have a serious discussion about literature and prize culture. We still want to have fun. And we still want to hear from you about the books that matter. So this year’s Not the Booker prize begins like every other, with nominations for this year’s best fiction on this very blog and a public vote to whittle those nominations down to a shortlist.It’s here that the important change comes in. This year the public vote will choose three novels for our shortlist. One other book will be selected by the 2018 judging panel. And – here’s the new bit – inspired by a suggestion below the line from Ongley, we’re enlisting the help of Chester’s award-winning Storyhouse library and the 2019 independent bookseller of the year, Edinburgh’s Golden Hare Books. They’ll each select one novel to complete our shortlist of six.We’ll read those in turn, as always, at the rate of about one a week. I’ll post my thoughts here on the site and – crucially – you’ll be able to post your own opinions about the books below the line. Then there’s the final vote, the judges’ panel and the beautiful moment when we get to bestow an actual  mug on the lucky winner.At this stage, we only need one nomination for each title. So if someone else has already nominated your favourite novel, there’s no need to nominate it again – just tell us what it is about the novel that makes it so great.If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty, you can find all of our terms and conditions here – and how radiant and beautiful they are.

Official growth figures are due to be published next month.“The short-term outlook for the UK economy is very murky indeed, with a significant risk that a severe economic downturn will begin within the next six months,” NIESR said.Jagjit Chadha, director of the thinktank, which is Britain’s longest-established independent research institute, said no-deal Brexit would effectively “throw concrete” in the wheels of British trade with the EU at a moment when the UK is already “fragile and vulnerable” from a slowdown in growth.“However we look at it, there will not be much economic joy in such an exit,” he added.Alongside domestic uncertainty, growth in the world economy has deteriorated over recent months against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between the US and China, harming business confidence and serving as a brake on growth.It said Threadneedle Street could cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points and the Treasury could ramp up spending to offset the hit to the economy, enabling growth to remain at zero next year under such a scenario.“There is no palpable growth for some years to come following a no-deal Brexit,” Chadha said.The thinktank’s forecast for a no-deal scenario where the UK escapes recession next year could embolden Brexiters. However, it said public borrowing would rise sharply, breaking the Conservatives’ deficit reduction promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4844ef9c33fb0a90c9279d6af4c34a877f6351/741_828_4897_2939/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f151201598cf33bd1406845c2ef666be","title":"tell us about your favourite canal boat shop","story":"There are more licensed boats using Britain’s canals than at the height of the industrial revolution – and barge-based businesses are booming too.

Friendship, not showmanship, is valued by foreign governments. Bluster at home diminishes lustre abroad.Over many years, Brexiters constructed a fable that presents the UK as the helpless victim of an unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels. Their version of history has become ever more at odds with reality. Brave Britannia is increasingly portrayed as a heroic underdog determined to fight for its independence from Europe. It matters not a jot that the organisation from which the UK is purportedly seeking to escape is a decent grouping of democratic nations that the UK willingly joined, which it helped significantly to shape and of which at least half the British people now very much wish their country to remain a member.It is probably impossible to break the link between the fantastical tale and its fanatical followers. However, in the hope that rational argument still has some role to play in British public debate, the record should be set straight regarding the reality of the influence that Britain has brought to bear in shaping EU decisions and indeed the European project as a whole.I was in a social setting recently with a group of British people with differing views on Brexit. The issue was simmering below the surface when one of them proclaimed that the UK was leaving the EU because “we don’t like France telling us what to do”. This nonsensical, but not untypical, interpretation of relative French and British influence in Europe will come as a surprise to many not least to generations of French negotiators for whom frustration with the impact of “perfidious Albion” was a familiar EU experience. There is, of course, a fundamental contradiction between asserting that the EU is run by bureaucrats and that it is subject to excessive influence by other governments.For three decades I sat around the European negotiating table, worked the Brussels corridors and networked in EU capitals. The truth is that, throughout the years of its membership, the UK has been particularly effective in the pursuit of its interests.Like other member states, the UK has been represented around every EU negotiating table at every level as the decisions have been thrashed out. Sadly, many British people are not even aware that there were such tables to sit around. The UK also elected its members to the European parliament. Its EU commissioners helped to shape EU legislation. British nationals have held key positions in all the EU institutions.But British influence in the EU went well beyond that available to most member states. The UK’s impact was exceptional due to several factors. The quality of its civil servants. The effectiveness of its coordination mechanisms. The reach of its diplomacy. The potency of its networking. The admiration for its pragmatism. The predominance of the English language.British influence in Europe, it is true, was hamstrung in self-inflicted ways. The UK’s decision to opt out of some key policy areas diminished British influence in other areas. London governments, partly driven by a jingoistic media, often favoured short-term tactics over long-term strategy. If the UK had put as much heart as it did head into its European policy, its influence would have been much greater. David Cameron’s decision to pull the Conservatives out of the EPP Group in the European parliament diminished British influence there a development compounded by extreme British Eurosceptic MEPs more interested in throwing shapes rather than in shaping policy.Every member state has its strengths and weaknesses. But there is a wide measure of consensus across Europe that British influence on the EU has been exceptional and immense. The EU today looks more like the one the UK wanted a quarter of a century ago than the one France had in mind.Brexit will change all that. Europe will be the poorer for the loss of British influence. But Britain itself will be diminished even more. It is important that our British friends understand the influence they once had in Europe so that they also know what they are giving up. As an EU, without the UK, continues to shape the legislation and regulatory standards that will affect British business, France will be delighted to find that it has more scope to “tell the UK what to do” than was ever possible when the UK significantly influenced every decision.• Bobby McDonagh was Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009-2013"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bab060b1b9ecc00a8139831577c53ae4ea09d45b/0_0_3453_2071/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7d5f70c2673a6bcc517fffba75c3fe","title":"republicans progressives red baiting socialism","story":"Condemnation of Democratic congresswomen is xenophobic, dangerous and flat-out falseThe Republican party has come out swinging against socialism – a strategy sure to be a mainstay of its 2020 campaigns. “Our opposition to our socialist colleagues,” the Wyoming senator Liz Cheney claimed, referring to the congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, “has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, with their religion, or with their race. It has to do with the content of their policies. They are wrong when they attempt to impose the fraud of socialism on the American people. They are wrong when they pursue policies that would steal power from the American people and give that power to the government.”It’s a bold line coming from the daughter of a man, the former vice-president Dick Cheney, who did more to centralize power in the executive branch than perhaps any other public official in living memory. It’s also a bald-faced lie. Cheney’s diatribe against socialism – like Trump’s racist railing against the same group of progressive freshman congresswomen to “go back” to where they “originally came from” – has a long legacy in American history: it’s called red baiting.And this round is no less xenophobic than those before it. When New York legislators voted to suspend five socialist state assembly members in 1920, they did so on the grounds that they were “enemy aliens” who had been “elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States”.The first red scare – well before the more well-known McCarthyism of the 1950s and 1960s – saw hundreds of real and suspected leftists deported under the Immigration Act of 1918. It also fueled the revived popularity of the antisemitic tract The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, with one well-circulated version replacing “Jews” with “bolsheviki”. Unsurprisingly, many of the most prolific anti-communists were also committed segregationists who violently fought black-led labor and civil rights organizing in the south, accusing members of groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee of being dupes for the Comintern. Nearly two decades before brutally suppressing Martin Luther King’s campaign to integrate Birmingham’s business district, the commissioner of public safety, Bull Connor, cut his teeth by waging war on communists in the same city.Throughout American history, attacks on so-called radicals have fit hand-in-glove with racist and anti-immigrant politics. The message – whether to Jewish anarchists, CIO unionists or (hardly socialist) Barack Obama – has never been subtle: you don’t belong here.The idea behind red-baiting has always been that there’s something inherently foreign to the US about the left – that despite the longtime presence of socialism in America it’s some toxic import, whether from the Soviet Union or elsewhere. And the CIA and FBI have spared no expense in violently suppressing socialists at home and abroad, from the killing of the Black Panther party’s Fred Hampton in Chicago to the overthrow of the democratically elected leftwing government of Chile’s Salvador Allende.Whatever lies the GOP throws out to try to cloud that fact, the kind of democratic socialism being voiced by politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib isn’t any closer to the Soviet Union than our republic is to ancient Rome’s. The goal is straightforward: orient society around protecting human and planetary wellbeing, not the endless accumulation of corporate profits.If the GOP wants to stake its electoral chances on red-baiting politicians’ seedy plots to give people free healthcare and a livable planet, so be it: there are more of us than there are of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab09daea537fcb7aa8dcaddb57bcfa7871d6cff3/0_65_4601_2760/master/4601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e358436d5b1b0e7af08fe7c93f280949","title":"summer job wet wales ice cream parlour childhood","story":"It was the summer after my first year of university, and I was back in uniform for the first time since school. The blue baseball cap and polo shirt combination was not glamorous, and I hated wearing my hair up, but the ice-cream parlour in the Snowdonian village of my childhood was hiring, and I needed the work.These sorts of summer jobs are on the decline among young people with technology at their disposal, but I didn’t have the option to become an influencer or an internet millionaire. Back home, everyone I knew worked a summer job, but my distinctly posher university friends were off on adventures: backpacking around South America, repairing to their families’ houses in the south of France, Interrailing. I had already wasted a substantial wodge of cash on a quixotic attempt at a law degree that had me begging fervently to transfer courses before the tedium of property law actually killed me. Back in the village I had worked so hard to leave, I was doubting whether I could afford university at all.The ice-cream parlour was a fairly new addition to the high street, but in a village with a thriving summer tourist economy it seemed like a good bet. Other friends were stacking shelves at Tesco or doing gruelling kitchen shifts, while the parlour was a friendly family business adored by my ice-cream-loving autistic brother, who would pop in with my mum before his walk around the lake. They treated their staff with kindness and we responded with enthusiasm and respect. Furthermore, they were happy for us to try out the ice-cream, which was homemade. I can still recall the creamy mascarpone-infused strawberry cheesecake the richness of the dark, milkless chocolate. Access to the counter’s rainbow array of flavours would have been the fulfilment of any child’s dream.What the family hadn’t banked on was the summer being one of the wettest any of us could remember. Sheets of torrential rain swept the high street, and even the most foolhardy of amateur climbers took one look at Snowdon and packed off home. (We have a local saying along the lines of: if you can’t see Snowdon, it’s raining. If you can, it’s still raining.) Occasionally a family of tourists in kagoules would drift in reeling from the deluge, but for long periods of time the shop was empty. This must have been extremely worrying for the owners, whose business was fairly new, but what it meant for me was silence and solitude. Hours of it, sometimes.In hindsight, I was depressed. Not because of the job, which gave me some structure and routine (in between shifts, I mostly lay on the sofa), but because of life events. I had dropped out of my course, had no money, and had had a bad breakup. London felt lonely and expensive, infested by privilege. Despite being in a sort of despairing fugue state, I spent my days serving up, with a smile, marshmallow pink ice-cream to children.“I don’t know why you’d want to live in London,” my boss said, after which I merely glanced pointedly to the biblical gale twisting its way down the high street. A boy I had known since primary school slouched past and we shared a fag on the pavement outside. “I have to get out of here before I become someone’s dad,” he told me, taking rapid puffs. I knew what he meant: Kirsty MacColl’s twist on the Billy Bragg line “All the girls I knew at school were already pushing prams” came to mind. The fissure between those who leave and those who stay had already opened, and I had not yet picked a side. I had entered the adult world without a backwards glance but here I was again, immersed in childhood.What did I learn? That a boss who allows you to read in the quiet moments is invaluable. I made my way through my new course list: Calvino, Elsa Morante, Levi, Pirandello, John Berger’s Ways of Seeing. I read the classics my mother had left in my room two years before as a gentle nudge that law might not have been the right choice: Tess of the D’Urbervilles (things could be worse), Mansfield Park, little taster scoops of Ulysses. But before too long I had jettisoned them all for children’s literature: The Georgia Nicholson books by Louise Rennison, Just William, all the Harry Potter books.A part-time or summer job is a crucial stepping stone to adulthood, but what I hadn’t realised at the time was how it helped me accept my childhood. The children of the ice-cream parlour’s owners, and those who came into the shop, were in heaven. The Welsh mountains provided them with the freedom and adventure that I had come to take for granted.It would be the last summer I went home for the vacation. Not long afterwards, one of the kindly owners died, leaving behind a young family and a business that is thankfully thriving to this day. London was not to his taste, but it was to mine, and I came to make a success of it. But I owe my job at the ice-cream parlour for helping me get there, and for teaching me that becoming an adult doesn’t mean leaving the whole of your childhood behind.I dropped in there not long ago, with an old friend who has been very ill. There was some other teenager behind the counter. I asked for dark chocolate, and my friend chose bubblegum, and I teased her for choosing like a kid would. We walked around the rim of the lake and talked about who was dead and who was in prison and who had had another baby, as we always do.

Despite how the world often chooses to represent me.Every other day you will probably see “granny” used in reference to older women: on the BBC in broadsheets and tabloids in the local press on YouTube and other social media. It’s a veritable granny fest.“‘What a f****** woman’ – Granny has time of her life.” This is the headline letting us know that an older woman was having a ball at the Glasgow’s TRNSMT festival earlier this month, singing along with Lewis Capaldi on the shoulders of a younger man.It may come as a shock, but a lot of older women are not grandmothers. But regardless of whether we have grandchildren or not – we older women are not defined by our reproductive organs.I co-founded Advantages of Age, a social enterprise which is challenging media stereotypes around ageing. It is disturbing to see the way older women are reduced to simply “grannies” as far as the media is concerned.The Sun can be depended upon for a gran cliche. “Welcome to Granbia,” it announces, “Gambia has become a sex paradise for British grans that makes Magaluf look tame.” Older women are not allowed to be sexual beings either.A few weeks ago, the  ran a piece about “the over-50 influencers defying stereotypes” – the piece featured the headline: “We’re the #instagrans.” While the piece was actually positive, it still managed to be needlessly patronising about how older people use the internet: “The furthest into the internet an over-50 might travel is Facebook to keep an eye on the kids and post the occasional blurry picture of the garden.”Naturally, among the users of our Facebook group, this kind of representation is a source of passionate discord.On YouTube, there’s a whole genre of videos devoted to grainy footage of raving grannies, inevitably featuring a white-haired woman DJing or dancing wildly at a festival. You’ll see headlines such as “This 80-year-old Polish granny DJs every week in Warsaw”. I love that older women are still dancing and enjoying music in an uninhibited manner – but do they have to be patronised along the way? There’s a distinct pat-them-on-the-head tone to all of this.The French Front National once tried to counteract Madonna’s criticisms of its hateful agenda by calling her “Granny Gaga”. Lynn Barber once referred to Debbie Harry as “a plump granny” – that is shameful coming from another woman and, of course, Harry doesn’t have any children.Grannies seem to be all around us: murdering grannies, boxing grannies, sky-ing grannies, grieving grannies … According to Bloomberg: “Grannies in running shoes deliver ramen for Uber Eats in Japan.” And then the BBC weighs in with “Family drugs gang granny Angela Collingbourne jailed” and “South Africa’s boxing grannies” are all over the internet.Somehow men are writers, war veterans, engineers, artists, politicians before they are ever labelled grandad.Ageism is a massive problem in society today – look at what happens to the over-50s in the workplace – and by permitting this level of granny-ism, the media and others are compounding the many negative and unfair stereotypes around older women. We need to be seen as valuable, loved and intelligent elders – the media can help by stopping this demeaning Instagran culture.• Rose Rouse is the editor and co-founder of Advantages of Age, a social enterprise challenging media stereotypes around ageing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b983e3b8becc7992baaf1e01d56df66e8301c6bc/0_80_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574e7e6a56ecd4bab3495ea3a6e2262f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

Whooshes and whirrs then emanate from the stage as he performs a rare outing of the 1992 Pulp B-side Space.Located at Jodrell Bank Observatory, Bluedot is a weekend-long monument to the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. There’s a replica lunar module and Helen Sharman gives a talk on being the first British astronaut. You can smell space at one stall – a bit nothingy, although the Milky Way is quite fruity and Mars pungent and sulphuric. There’s even an experiment that bounces voice messages from the artists and the audience off the moon and plays back the warped versions. Here, science is as culturally celebrated as music, which makes for an endearing, unique mix of people and their passions – a balance that stretches to being wholesome without feeling sterile.Jarvis doesn’t quite follow through on his promise of ascension into outer realms, but instead plays a set of mostly new, unreleased material from his new Jarv Is project. The latest single Must I Evolve? unfurls with pulsing repetitions, and House, an on-the-nose ode to house music, oozes galloping, elongated grooves. “Whoever the next Tory leader is, I dedicate this to them,” he says, announcing Cunts Are Still Running the World as a mud-caked crowd partake in a hearty, sweary singalong.Elsewhere, Squid play a brilliantly potent blend of free-form no wave and hyper-taut post-punk, Jon Hopkins’ safe rave stuffs the tent to bursting point and Audiobooks play a compelling set of oddball electro-pop. The daytime lineup often doesn’t match the excitement or quality of the evenings, but Kraftwerk’s only UK performance of the year turns out to be a perfect headline set.From the opening gargles of Numbers, they sound utterly pristine. It’s a riotously dance-heavy set at times, too. A remixed Computer Love weaves in and out of its sweet, almost symphonic pop melody, crashing around fizzing beats and crackling electronics. It’s thrilling to hear them tweak their own music in a way that feels flawlessly tight yet expansive and flowing. Similarly, Radioactivity palpitates with new life as it reaches almost euphoric levels and Tour de France seems to last as long as the race itself but never loses an iota of momentum.With no new music in 16 years, Kraftwerk’s current pursuit of modernity seems to exist more in perfecting the purity of their sound and distilling their own back catalogue into sparkling new variations. When they play a pulsating and propulsive Autobahn, it’s staggering to think it’s now 45 years old. Only five years separate the band’s own ground zero moment and the moon landing – and both stand as futuristic accomplishments achieved during times of relatively primitive technology. Five decades on, these achievements still seem almost inconceivable.For all the celebrations of futuristic pursuits past and present, the closing set from New Order ends the festival on a beautifully poignant note. Ian Curtis is buried just a few miles away from the site, and the band’s closing finale of Atmosphere and Love Will Tear Us Apart shows that listening to Joy Division’s music in the endless drizzle can feel just as otherworldly as Bluedot’s more explicitly spacey visions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f430589ea9af5655ead075a82ab0abeed24e4f32/0_103_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d5afdd316ea0e5ebb65351fde0c451","title":"four inspirational days in nova scotia","story":"South London artist and muralist Remi Rough finds visual inspiration in the region’s rocky landscapes, colourful villages and journeys on water … and captures it in a muralI’ll be completely honest the only thing I knew about Nova Scotia before I went was that rapper and hip-hop artist Buck 65 is from there! What I found was a completely charming province, and one that’s very erse, too, with so many different experiences you can have. You’ve got city life in Halifax, then sprawling national parks, and so much of life here is led on or by the water. I came here with the challenge of creating a mural on a building in Halifax, and I found so much inspiration along the way. The result was amazing – I left a little piece of myself on the harbour front.As there are year-round direct flights from London to Halifax and they only take six hours, you can get right into the Halifax swing of things without long transfers or bad jet lag. Spend your first morning walking along its historic harbour front to get a feel for the city. It has great cultural experiences where you can learn more about the region’s past, like the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. The Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum is particularly moving – while ship’s survivors went to New York, all who perished came to Halifax, and you can learn about their poignant personal stories here.One of the absolute gems of this region is the quaint, colourful village of Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site. Established in 1753 by the Brits, it’s just an hour’s drive from Halifax, and is best known for its beautiful, multicoloured 18th- and 19th-century buildings. There are so many shades, from tomato red, to deep purple and peppermint green ... strolling around and taking it all in is a delight, especially along King St, which has been nicknamed “the Unesco fresco”.Lunenburg is the perfect place to go kayaking. Set off from the bay at Blue Rocks, a spectacular 10-minute drive along the coast from the town of Lunenburg, and paddle through dozens of little channels out to the open sea. There’s plenty of nature around - I saw an osprey, and a huge heron. And I do love that people here spend so much time outdoors – they have everything on their doorstep.Back in Lunenburg, lunch at the Beach Pea Kitchen \u0026amp Bar  – they have some cracking fishcakes. Most restaurants here serve fish and seafood, and it’s all so beautifully fresh. Spend the rest of the day hanging out in town, just walking around and taking in the scenery and the slower pace of life. For dinner, treat yourself to lobster at the Old Fish Factory restaurant, one of the best places in town for it.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site, about an hour from Lunenburg, has got an incredible collection of petroglyphs, stories carved on rocks by the Mi’kmaq, a First Nations people, thousands of years ago. Our guide was great, and told us all about their history, and the people who’d created the carvings. The Mi’kmaw people, for instance, are credited with inventing the ice hockey stick – they are recorded as having played the game as early as the 18th century. Today, October is celebrated as Mi’kmaq history month, and the entire Mi’kmaw Nation celebrates Treaty Day annually on 1 October – the date when the Peace and Friendship treaty of 1752 was signed by the Mi’kmaq of Shubenacadie and the Brits.Peggy’s Cove is the perfect place to stretch your legs on the drive back to Halifax, and take in some amazing views of sea and sky. It’s got a strikingly elegant lighthouse, but what impressed me most were the rocks which covered the whole area – it looked like the moon, a completely alien landscape.Finish the day back in Halifax dining with locals at Edna, which stands for “eat, drink, nourish, always”. It does a mix of fish, meat and veggie dishes, and you eat at communal tables, which is fun.Start your morning with a sail around Halifax harbour on the stunning schooner Bluenose II. It’s a faithful reconstruction of the first Bluenose, a 1920s racing and fishing ship that, unfortunately, sank in 1946. We set off at full sail and got amazing views of Halifax from the water. The captain, Phil, is a great character, with a huge beard!Then it was time to do my mural the space was a stairwell at the back of the Marriott Harbourfront hotel. Normally it would take me around three days to do a piece this size (it’s around 7 x 10 metres) but we only had a day! I used inspiration from all the places I’d seen, so there were lots of muted greens to represent things like moss on the rocks at Peggy’s Cove, and mustard colours for the seaweed at Blue Rocks, then lighter notes like peppermint green for the houses in Lunenburg.For dinner, try the Bicycle Thief, a lovely, laid-back Italian restaurant. The spaghetti with meatballs is massive and delicious!The next day, before I left for the airport, I spent a few more hours finishing the mural. A lot of people helped, like a guy from the crew of the Bluenose II, who’s also a street artist. It felt great to give something to the community I hope they like it! I’d love to come back and spend more time in Nova Scotia – hopefully that’ll happen soon.Inspired to visit?

And in an age when any old slob can be made to look like a superhero with a bit of green screen and CGI, unadulterated old-school stunts such as fist fights and car chases are in high demand. So who are you gonna call? Increasingly, the answer seems to be Leitch and Stahelski.Far from household names, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski are very well known in Hollywood. Both from martial arts backgrounds, they went into movie stunts, establishing their own company, 87eleven, in 1997. They are the people who design the stunt sequences, provide the personnel and train the actors – from Scarlett Johansson to Keanu Reeves – the latter of whom Stahelski stunt-doubled for in the Matrix movies.After doing second-unit directing on movies such as Captain America: Civil War and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, they realised they had everything they needed to make movies by themselves. So did Reeves, who asked them to direct the first John Wick in 2014. Detractors might sneer that the movie was basically one giant action sequence with a few dialogue breaks, but Stahelski and Leitch knew how to make that work, tempering the machismo with Reeves’s inherent soulfulness, and providing the slick, inventive, mordantly violent thrills that audiences crave. Stahelski went on to direct the Wick sequels while Leitch has directed Charlize Theron’s Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, and now the Fast \u0026amp Furious spin-off Hobbs \u0026amp Shaw, with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham.Stunt performers often take pride in their unsung heroism but certain insiders have always recognised their value. No surprises that Quentin Tarantino is a stunt aficionado. His forthcoming Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood hinges on the co-dependent dynamic between a washed-up TV cowboy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his laidback stunt double-cum-chauffeur, Brad Pitt. Pitt has regularly required stunt doubles, specifically for Mr \u0026amp Mrs Smith where his tricky action work was performed by David Leitch.Rumour has it that Tarantino based DiCaprio and Pitt’s characters on Burt Reynolds and his long-time stunt double Hal Needham. The two were so close that Needham lived on Reynolds’s property for nearly 12 years, then directed him in action movies including The Cannonball Run and Hooper (about a Hollywood stuntman). Tarantino gave a speech when Needham became the second stunt person ever to receive an honorary Academy Award in 2012. It could be a while before Stahelski and Leitch reach such heights but things are heading in the right direction: Stahelski’s next gig is a reboot of Highlander Leitch just signed a “first-look” deal with Universal. If anyone has paid their action movie dues, it is surely them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96fb66c79369dbb98941f070620007a0e676c6bc/144_103_2995_1796/master/2995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d033e8e6e9076754cf7097c784a6ab33","title":"natalie portman confirmed as mighty thor in marvel sequel","story":"Actor will reprise Dr Jane Foster character who takes on Thor’s powers in Thor: Love and ThunderNatalie Portman will take up the mantle of Thor in the upcoming Marvel sequel Thor: Love and Thunder, announced on Saturday.Stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, and director Taika Waititi, will also return from 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, and Portman will reprise her character of Dr Jane Foster, who debuted in the 2011 original. For fans confused by the character and gender shift, Waititi explained that the movie would be based on an existing 2014 comic book storyline where Thor loses his abilities and Jane Foster wields his powers and magical hammer Mjolnir.Further details of the plot have not been released, but the New Zealand director clarified that her name would be Mighty Thor.And at the end of Hemsworth’s most recent on-screen appearance in Avengers: Endgame, the character had left his role as ruler of Asgard to join the s of the Galaxy team, and appointed Thompson’s Valkyrie character as his replacement.Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth instalment in the franchise, and Waititi’s second time directing a Marvel film.Portman has not featured in a Thor franchise film since 2013’s Thor: The Dark World, which was not well received critically. But Waititi’s Marvel debut with Ragnarok was praised for injecting a newfound sense of humour and style into the ailing franchise.Portman posted on Instagram that she was “thrilled” to return to the series and to work with Hemsworth and Thompson.“Remember this as the before picture for when I get jacked,” she joked.No details have been released about whether Tom Hiddleston, who portrayed Thor’s brother Loki in the previous three films, would return. But Hiddleston was previously confirmed to feature in a new Marvel TV series, called Loki.Also announced on Saturday were a Black Widow film starring Scarlett Johansson, a sequel to Doctor Strange, a reboot of Blade starring Mahershala Ali, and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings – Marvel’s first Asian superhero film – starring Simu Liu and Awkwafina.Last week the James Bond franchise announced that female actor Lashanna Lynch would take over the mantle of agent 007 in the next film, with Daniel Craig also set to return as a retired James Bond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f4dc5eba8a7cfe4f3a29de8fad276ba8816e594/0_42_5338_3203/master/5338.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4bcda76682737e3b29b911f85546773","title":"20 best tomato recipes part 1 claire ptak tart fuchsia dunlop stir fry","story":"A classic pan con tomate, crispy tomato fritters and Chinese stir-fried eggs – simple dishes with summer’s finest ingredientThis is a quiche but the true stars here are the slow-roasted tomatoes. The custard is only there to gently wrap its arms around these tart and sweet, almost dried tomatoes and the creamy cheese. The pastry is rye and crisp – the perfect case for the rich filling.You will need baking parchment and baking beans for this recipe.Makes one 23cm tartFor the oven-roasted tomatoesheirloom tomatoes 800g (about 5-6) in different colours thyme 10 sprigs olive oil 4 tbsp pomegranate molasses 3 tbsp sea salt and pepper For the rye pastryice cube 1cold water 60mlrye flour 175g plain flour 50g fine sea salt ½ tsp unsalted butter 150g, cold and cut into 1cm cubesFor the fillingplain flour 2 tbsp large eggs 2 whole milk 200g sea salt and peppertriple cream cheese 200g, such as Delice de Bourgone, or a double cream cheese like brieHeat the oven to 150Cgas mark 2.

Place them skin-side down in the prepared dish and drizzle with the oil and pomegranate molasses, tuck in the thyme and season well with salt and pepper. Bake for 2 hours until reduced and concentrated and beginning to dry out.Meanwhile make the pastry. Add an ice cube to the water and stir a few times. Set aside.Add the flours and salt to a food processor, or bowl if you don’t have one, and blitz a few times or whisk together. Add the cold butter and mix until you have a sandy texture. Add the water (removing any unmelted ice) and blitz (or mix in) until it just starts to form a ball. Turn out onto a floured surface and press together a few times to form a ball. Press into a flat disc and wrap with clingfilm. Chill for 30-45 minutes. If you have to chill it longer, it will be fine but you will need to let it soften slightly before rolling out. When you’re ready, roll the pastry out to a few millimetres thickness. I like to roll rye pastry thicker than normal pastry because it is more brittle but also because it can handle being thicker without seeming stodgy.Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Press into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin and trim the sides. Chill for 10 minutes. Line the shell with parchment and fill with ceramic or dry baking beans. Bake for 25 minutes until the pastry is almost baked. Let cool for 5 minutes before removing the paper and beans. Bake again for 5-7 minutes until the pastry gets a little colour. Remove and make the filling.Whisk together all of the filling ingredients except the cheese. Pour through a sieve and set aside.Fill the pre-baked rye pastry shell with the roasted tomatoes. Dot with large chunks of the cheese and pour over the strained custard mix. Drizzle with any remaining tomato juices. Place on a tray in the middle of your oven (still at 180Cgas mark 4) and bake for about 25-30 minutes. This is a shallow quiche so it bakes quite quickly. Adjust the time if you use a deeper or smaller tin. Cool slightly and serve with a leafy salad.Claire Ptak is the owner of Violet Cakes, London E8 Traditionally, for pan con tomate people used bread that was a day or two old, which would come to life with the juice of the tomato. My favourite is pan de coca (a Catalan flatbread) or alternatively pan de payés (country loaf), or a slice of sourdough. In the Basque country they often use a baguette, though this wouldn’t be my first choice, as once rubbed with tomato the soft texture can become too pasty. Look for bread with a good crust and quite an open airy texture – not dense and solid – that will crisp up nicely if you are toasting it. Industrial sliced bread won’t do, as it will just become a mush.You also need good olive oil, something fruity but not overpowering, such as Arbequina, which will complement the sweetness of the tomato. Use as much as you like, but remember that you might end up with oil running down your arm as you eat.Inevitably, there is always an argument over which of the few ingredients should go on to the bread or toast first. At home the way we do it is to toast a pile of good bread, then put out the halved tomatoes, cut cloves of garlic (for those who want them), a bottle of good extra virgin olive oil and some sea salt, and let everyone help themselves. If you are happy using your fingers this is really the best way, however messy.If you are using garlic I would say only do so if the bread is toasted, and then rub it on before the tomato, as the roughness of the toast’s surface gives you something to grate the cloves against, and it will embed itself better if the bread is not already soaked in tomato. Next I would squeeze the juice into the toast until it is coloured bright red and all that is left of the tomatoes is their skin. Ideally, you will have more juice than flesh on the toast, so it looks as if it has been painted red.Some say salt should come next, then oil, as this helps the salt to impregnate the bread, but I like to drizzle on the oil first and rub it in, then scatter on sea salt, as I love the crunch it gives.Eat straight away, neat, or with whatever topping you like, from slices of cured ham or sausage to anchovies, or manchego cheese. Freshly cooked kippers are good too.From Brindisa: The True Food of Spain by Monika Linton (Fourth Estate, £29.95)When the Chinese of the coastal provinces first encountered the tomato, it reminded them of more familiar fruits and vegetables, which is why it became known as a “barbarian aubergine” or a “Western red persimmon”. Here, then, is a recipe for “barbarian aubergines” stir-fried with eggs, which I ate every other day when I lived in Sichuan. It’s beautiful, with its vivid mix of red and yellow, and seems much more delicious than the sum of its parts. I’ve given a recipe for two eggs and two tomatoes, which you can increase by an egg and tomato or two if you please. The potato flour mixture, if added, gives an extra luxuriousness to the juices, but isn’t strictly necessary.Serves 1ripe tomatoes 2, similar in volume to the eggseggs 2 saltcooking oil 4 tbsp caster sugar ½ tsp potato flour ½ tsp mixed with 2 tsp water (optional)Cut each tomato in half, then into sections the size of tangerine segments. Beat the eggs evenly together with a little salt.Heat 3 tbsp of the oil in a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add the beaten eggs and swirl them around. Use a wok scoop or a ladle to nudge the edges of the egg towards the centre, so the uncooked egg can run out. As soon as the egg has set (it may be a little golden), remove it from the wok.Return the wok to the high flame with the final 1 tbsp oil if you need it. Tip in the tomatoes and stir-fry until they are hot and smell cooked and delicious, adding the sugar and salt to taste. Then return the eggs to the wok and mix everything together. Add the potato flour mixture, if using, and serve.From Every Grain of Rice by Fuschia Dunlop (Bloomsbury Publishing, £25)The year-long warm climate in Mexico means plump, sun-ripened tomatoes are always available so you will see fresh tomatoes – never tinned – used. They’re an essential ingredient in dishes from classic salsa roja, where tomatoes are charred for a rich smoky flavour, to soups, stews and guisados (mains) like this chicken tinga, to be served with tacos, quesadillas or tostadas.

Remove the cooked chicken from the broth and, when cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones. Tear the chicken into shreds. Set aside. Strain and reserve the stock.Finely slice the remaining onion. Add 100ml olive oil to a pan and sauté the onions until translucent. Remove from the heat and reserve.Prepare 1kg of tomatoes by removing (and reserving) the centre and the seeds of the tomatoes. Slice the rest of the flesh into short thin strips and set aside for later. In a blender add 500ml of reserved chicken stock, the remaining 4 garlic cloves and the reserved tomato centres and seeds. Roughly chop the remaining plum tomatoes and add to the blender. Blitz until completely pureed, then strain the mixture to remove the seeds.In a deep pot, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil, add the blended tomato mixture and cook on a medium heat until the tomato starts changing colour, about 5 minutes.Season with the salt, oregano, chipotles in adobo, star anise, remaining 6 bay leaves and black pepper. Add the reserved sliced tomatoes and cook until soft. Add the sauteed onions. Add the shredded chicken at the end and mix all the ingredients thoroughly.Let everyone make their own tostadas de tinga.

The crunchy crumbs lend texture, and a crisp fillet of mackerel crowns the dish.This is a feast, and one you can come back to time and again, with or without the mackerel (which should be line-caught to help preserve future populations).If you can find juicy black olives like kalamata with the stones still in, they will transform the recipe.5 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced2 heads fennel, tough outer layer removed, cut into 5mm slices, fronds reserved300g spaghetti½ tsp dried chilli16 black olives, stoned and halved1 ½ tbsp capers4 tbsp vermouth or white wine (optional)Salt and black pepper4 sustainably sourced mackerel (or plaice) fillets 1 handful parsley leaves, roughly choppedLemon wedges, to serveFor the anchovy breadcrumbs3 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly bashed4 anchovy fillets60g breadcrumbsFirst, make the breadcrumbs. In a frying pan, warm the oil and garlic over a medium-low heat for about three minutes, until the garlic begins to colour and turn wrinkly. Turn the heat up to medium and add the anchovies, squishing them into the pan. Add the breadcrumbs, tossing them in the anchovy oil until they’re nicely coated and beginning to colour – three to four minutes. Once they’re a nice toasty colour, take off the heat and leave to cool in the pan.Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and add three tablespoons of oil. Add the garlic and fennel, and cook gently until they begin to soften – eight to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, put a pan of salted water on to boil and cook the pasta.Once the fennel is soft and the garlic fragrant, add the chilli, olives, capers and vermouth (if using use some pasta water if not). Let it bubble away for a minute or two and reduce to a sauce, season, then take off the heat until the pasta is ready.Once the pasta is al dente, drain, reserving half a cup of the cooking liquid. Transfer the pasta to the pan with the fennel sauce, with a few splashes of its liquid, and put on a very low heat.Put the frying pan on a high heat. After a few minutes, add a tablespoon of oil, season the mackerel fillets well and fry, skin side down first, for two to three minutes on each side, until just done.Stir the parsley and any fennel fronds into the pasta, then transfer to plates. Top each plate with a mackerel fillet, sprinkle over the anchovy breadcrumbs and serve with a wedge of lemon.For a simpler dish, braise some squid slowly in a pan with the fennel, with delicious results. If you’re vegetarian, omit the mackerel and, instead of the anchovy, dry some more black olives in a low oven for an hour, before blitzing with the breadcrumbs.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

But while City were hoping their performances would cement their growing popularity in the country, an editorial with the headline “Chinese fans’ love for Man City goes unreciprocated on home soil” which appeared on Xinhua’s English language website on Monday appeared to suggest their conduct on the tour had produced the opposite effect.Citing the failure of Guardiola’s squad to engage with local media and supporters, it goes on to accuse City of only coming to China due to a “desire to win wallets, not hearts and minds”.“For the Premier League champions, their appearance in China was nothing more than a commercial obligation, and their lack of enthusiasm and the indifferent treatment of their hosts stands in stark contrast to representatives of other clubs,” read the article.“For Manchester City, they saw their recent success as a reason not to treat Chinese and foreigners with the same respect. Above all, it was an orientalist expectation on display by the Manchester City press relations staff that Chinese media would operate as an extension of their PR department, rather than as serious football journalists.“An attitude of arrogance and the belief that they were the main attraction to the Premier League Asia Trophy was misplaced and stood in direct contrast to the other clubs. Wolves could not do more to engage with fans and even Newcastle, despite arriving under a cloud of off-field negativity, treated China with the utmost respect and dignity. Today those clubs leave China with a new-found respect and new fans Manchester City leave China with neither.”City have refused to comment on the article, although it is understood that they believe it is not representative of the squad’s experiences in China. A few hours after it was published, a story with the headline “Bernardo and De Bruyne amazed by reaction in China” appeared on the club’s website which detailed some of the off-pitch appearances made by City players this week, including “a number of open training sessions and supporter signing sessions, with the excitement from local fans clear throughout”.Asked whether the reception had made him proud to play for the club, Portugal international and player of the season Bernardo Silva responded: “It makes us feel like we are doing good work. People like us. And to come here to China and get this support is just amazing, so we’re very happy to be here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/631c3982c5d042f068c29baa06421cce9de13dd7/0_187_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902297fa40a5457ba4ddcd729c6dac28","title":"southampton continue to invest in youth after gao jishengs boardroom reshuffle","story":"Spool forward to this summer and a round of musical chairs that was prompted, in part, by the departure of the chairman Ralph Krueger, upon the expiry of his contract. Krueger was ready for a new challenge and he has returned to NHL ice hockey, where he has become the coach of the Buffalo Sabres.The headline item of Southampton’s top-level reshuffle has been Gao’s decision to take on the post of chairman and, once again, it has led to questions about his intentions. He remains based in China and, so far, he has only truly got involved in club affairs when it has come to the sacking of managers (Mauricio Pellegrino and Mark Hughes) and the setting of budgets at the start of a season. Is now the time for him to tighten his grip?Nobody at the club really knows and it is fair to say that an element of mystery surrounds Gao, who has maintained a radio silence in England since his takeover. He has two employees from China in Southampton, who work in and out of the training ground while a third, based in China, has been credited with the unusual shirt sponsorship deal that the club announced in May with LD Sports.Southampton describe LD Sports as a “new sports content, marketing and entertainment platform”, although little is known about the Chinese brand. Where is the money coming from?What the Southampton board do know is that Gao does not intend to invest significantly in the playing squad. Before this window, the club’s transfer dealings under his stewardship showed a £7.7m profit and, although money has been spent this time – namely on Danny Ings, Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo – there will be book-balancing sales to follow those of Matt Targett and Sam Gallagher.Southampton have encouraged the agents of Mario Lemina and Charlie Austin to push their clients to interested clubs Jordy Clasie is primed to return to Holland and Guido Carrillo has offers in South America. The problem could be that Carrillo prefers to stay in Europe. Wesley Hoedt has returned for pre-season in good shape but the club will listen to offers for him, together with Fraser Forster, Cédric Soares and Sofiane Boufal.All eyes are on the transfer market and the signing of the pacy and dangerous Adams from Birmingham has quickened the pulse. Yet he has not been the only striker to swap St Andrew’s for St Mary’s. When Southampton announced the capture of the 16-year-old Ramello Mitchell from Birmingham at the beginning of July, it made waves in youth football, not least because Manchester United and Liverpool had wanted him, and it also shone a light on how the club are continuing to adapt their recruitment strategy.There was a time when Southampton would stick to harvesting their youth players from within a 90-minute radius of the club – plus their satellite academy in Bath, for which they were given special dispensation because of their location on the coast there are no footballers to be found in the Channel.But the realisation came to dawn that they had to do more they had to compete on a broader playing field, particularly for talent aged 16-18. And so they started to hunt for young players on a national scale and in specific European countries – namely France, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia.Yan Valery, who was taken from Stade Rennais in 2015 at the age of 16, was the trailblazer and the club have since signed others from outside their traditional catchment area. Michael Obafemi joined from Leyton Orient in 2016 and Kayne Ramsey came from Chelsea in 2017 – the year that the club also took the highly-rated winger Enzo Robise from Reims and the midfielder Will Ferry from Bury. Ferry is current academy player of the year.The standout purchases at this level last summer were those of the midfielder Alex Jankewitz from Servette and the centre-half Allan Tchaptchet from Sannois Saint-Gratien. The club paid an initial £400,000 for Jankewitz and the fee could rise to nearly £1m. He has just signed his first professional contract and is considered to be a superstar in the making.After Mitchell, Southampton announced the captures of the forward Sam Bellis from Manchester City and the attacking midfielder Marco Rus from Yeovil, while they have completed further deals to take 16-year-olds from elsewhere. Southampton were also in for the Fulham winger, Harvey Elliot, only for him to choose Liverpool.Each youngster has been attracted by the first-team pathway on offer, something that Southampton have long traded on and, under Ralph Hasenhüttl, can push afresh. The manager is committed to giving young players a chance and wants to work with a streamlined squad so as not to stifle upward growth from the academy.Southampton’s next pre-season friendly is against Guangzhou R\u0026ampF in Macau on Tuesday, which will be the latest nod towards Gao’s ownership. The club’s identity comes from elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51c03368c49084770b38ae8fb9ec09e123cca9da/0_0_6568_4379/master/6568.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6b568c3081aa9278afd50f48b3a33d9 700w","title":"how we met he had a reputation for playing the field he sounded really dodgy","story":"Amanda and Clive had been hearing about each other for about 10 years before they met. “We had mutual friends and I would always hear about Clive doing this or that, Clive on the picket line or Clive cheating on some girl,” she says, and Clive laughs. “Clive had a reputation for not sticking with girlfriends very long and just playing the field, so I wasn’t keen to meet him at all. He sounded really dodgy.”“I would hear wonderful things about you,” he says. “That you’d had lives in London and Barcelona, that you were a journalist and artist, and you sounded like someone I’d like to meet. There were several events I remember going to where people would say: ‘Amanda’s meant to be coming’ and then she never did. I was always a bit disappointed.”Finally, friends got them together over dinner in 1996, although not with the intention of setting them up. “By that time my impression of him was being tall, Germanic-looking, pretty arrogant,” says Amanda. “He wasn’t like I imagined at all. He was a lot quieter and more humble than I expected, and had a wicked sense of humour. That was my strong first impression of him – that he was full of joy, and fun to be around.”For Clive, he says it was a “feeling of shock. The moment I met Amanda I realised I would spend the rest of my life with her.” It wasn’t any one thing, he says, just that: “I’d never experienced anything like that.” Was it as definitive for Amanda? “Oh no, not at all,” she says. “I think he’s probably a bit more romantic than me. It took me about a year to decide that it was quite a serious relationship.”They got together that night – she dropped him at the tube station and they kissed – and when Amanda lost her job and had to rent out her flat she moved in with Clive. They had been together for about a year, so cohabiting happened sooner than they might have liked but, says Amanda, “it turned out to be quite a good thing”.She continues: “The other strange thing that happened was that Clive got nominated for an Oscar. Which was a complete shock. We were living in this semi-derelict flat in Islington. He was signing on I had just lost my job.” It was for the short film Holiday Romance, which Clive had written, and unbeknown to him, the director had submitted. “I was so thrown by it that I forgot to sign on. So I had to go to the office the next day and say: ‘Sorry I forgot – but I’d been nominated for an Oscar,” he says. Their lives became quite glamorous for a few weeks. “I think Amanda thought the rest of our lives was going to be like that,” says Clive and they laugh.Around the same time, they had, says Amanda, “a crucial conversation in a coffee bar”. Amanda was in her mid-30s and wanted children, and wanted to make sure Clive felt the same. If he didn’t, she told him, they would probably have to break up. “I think I went a bit pale and quiet,” says Clive. Amanda says: “But to his credit he said that’s what he wanted, too. For me, that was the turning point.”They now have two children, aged 16 and 18, and the family moved to Sydney in 2006 after Amanda was offered a job there. Their relationship works, says Amanda, mainly because “we have the same sense of humour we don’t let things fester. I’ve never met anyone who I admire as much as Clive. He’s a true egalitarian, and he lives his life along those values. I find that very unusual and admirable, and valuable for our children.”How was Amanda different from all of Clive’s previous girlfriends? “Whether it’s having children, travelling the world or just being at home together,” he says, “everything I do with Amanda feels like a funky adventure. It feels like we’re a team pulling in the same direction, rather than two people negotiating terms and conditions.”Want to share your story?

But how is that possible?Kirsten, 22, knew something strange was happening at about eight weeks into her pregnancy. The classic first trimester symptoms, such as weight gain, food aversions and nausea, were all arriving as expected – but she wasn’t the only one affected.Her partner, Silas, 23, was experiencing similar physical shifts. He started gaining weight and felt repelled by familiar foods. As Kirsten’s morning sickness took hold, he was struck with equally debilitating nausea. “I felt sick every day for weeks,” he says.Initially, Kirsten was sceptical. She worried that Silas’s symptoms were an elaborate joke, or that he was being insensitive. “But, as time went on, I realised he was truly suffering,” she says. “The nausea was the worst of it. He had it much worse than I did. I ended up sharing my morning sickness medication with him so he could get through the day.”Silas’s experience was no freak phenomenon. He had Couvade syndrome, otherwise known as a “sympathy pregnancy”. The mysterious – yet surprisingly common – condition causes pregnant women’s partners to manifest the physical and psychological symptoms of pregnancy. Those with the syndrome report abdominal pain, morning sickness, bloating and lethargy, as well as mood swings, memory loss and depression. In more extreme cases, they can even experience pseudocyesis, in which their stomach swells throughout their partner’s pregnancy, only to begin retracting after the birth.For Kalu, 25, the symptoms were brief, but all-consuming. During the first trimester of his partner’s pregnancy, he struggled with extreme anxiety and nausea. “My stomach was twisting and turning,” he says. “I was throwing up for days. The only thing I could eat were liquids, such as water and fruit smoothies.”It is easy to dismiss these men as simply being melodramatic, especially when you compare Couvade syndrome with the intense physical strain of a real pregnancy. Perhaps that is why there has been so little research into the causes.“I don’t think that people understand the nature of the disorder,” says Dr Arthur Brennan, a senior lecturer in nursing at Kingston University, who has written several research papers on the condition. “It sort of straddles the boundaries between a mental disorder and a physical disorder. It doesn’t fit tidily into one or the other category.”Couvade syndrome may not be limited to heterosexual human couples, although they make up the majority of the reported cases. Dr Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, says the most severe case of Couvade syndrome he has ever heard of came via a vet: “A woman developed a variant of Couvade syndrome triggered by her dog’s pregnancy: she had all the symptoms of the syndrome, and she knew she was not pregnant.”So what does cause Couvade syndrome? For a long time, it was believed to be purely psychological. Some early explanations, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, suggested that the symptoms were born out of a man’s envy of the woman’s ability to procreate. Others suggested it could be a way of erting attention back to the man, who can feel irrelevant or marginalised during pregnancy.But more recent studies have suggested that Couvade syndrome could be linked to empathy and attachment. Symptoms, it seems, are more prevalent in men with greater investment in their unborn baby, and increased involvement in the pregnancy.This was the case for Mike, 32. The tattoo artist had Couvade syndrome with all three of his partner Amanda’s pregnancies, experiencing morning sickness, pseudocyesis, exhaustion and heightened emotions. He believes it may have been down to the couple’s closeness. “We breathe each other’s air constantly,” he says. “We own a couple of businesses together, we live together, we work together and we have children together, so we’re very close. We also spend a lot of our free time together, too, because we’re friends.”There are potential physical explanations for Couvade syndrome. What we know from the very few studies that have been carried out so far is that men’s hormonal levels shift significantly during the antenatal period. Testosterone tends to diminish, while oestrogen and prolactin rise.“I’d say my oestrogen levels were all over the place when Amanda was pregnant,” says Mike. “I was an emotional wreck.”“My training regime practically stopped because I didn’t feel like I had the urge or energy. I’m quite a testosterone-y bloke: I’m mad on the gym, and I train hard and often. But when Amanda is pregnant, that just stops. My ‘want’ just disappears. I just get emotional and lazy, and eat cake.”“A number of studies have found that testosterone is lower,” Brennan agrees, “whereas prolactin tends to rise. The link, or the apparent trigger, is found in men who had the greatest concern or responsiveness to the unborn baby. Possibly, this could be to do with empathy, but it could be due to anxiety as well.”But for those with Couvade syndrome, it’s not really about finding answers. Instead, the priority is removing the stigma that surrounds the condition, and for it to be acknowledged as a legitimate part of the pregnancy process.“I don’t really think it’s a cause for research,” says Mike. “Obviously, some people may take the piss, or say I’m trying to steal the thunder from Amanda’s pregnancies. And, yeah, they are her pregnancies, but I can’t deny what’s going on.”If anything, he says, the syndrome should be celebrated as a symbol of intimacy between two parents (the couple are now working on a book about how to stay close during pregnancy, which they credit to the experience). “Couvade syndrome taught me to be more compassionate to have more understanding of what it was Amanda was going through – not just physically but mentally,” he says. “Maybe Couvade syndrome will give men more of an understanding of what a woman goes through when she pushes her body to its limits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00426b4b1b3a8c7e7d4e8d261efeaceff9c1dd01/92_305_4756_2854/master/4756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96658bb668ad7e158bc5a6b1afd9c05c","title":"live nation metallica tickets resale sites concerts","story":"Admission confirms rumours that labels and artists sell live music tickets to secondary marketLive Nation, the world’s largest live music firm, has admitted placing tickets for Metallica directly on to resale websites, despite having claimed that it is against ticket touting.In a secret recording of a telephone call between an associate of Metallica, a Live Nation business partner and a senior Live Nation executive, the executive outlined a plan to bypass the regular avenues by which fans buy tickets at face value.On the 11-minute call leaked to US music website Billboard, the executive can be heard saying that Ticketmaster, Live Nation’s official ticketing subsidiary, “will not do it”.He discussed sending the tickets direct to secondary ticketing companies, websites such as StubHub and Viagogo that allow touts to sell at large mark-ups.Live Nation admitted that it had placed the tickets, for Metallica’s 2017 WorldWired stadium tour of North America, directly on to the resale market, but insisted that this was unusual.“Live Nation does not have a practice of placing tickets on the secondary market. Our standard practice is to use Ticketmaster’s Platinum, VIP and other tools to help tours price closer to true market value,” said a spokesperson.“In this situation, a consultant for the band opted to use the secondary market to try to capture that value.”A representative for Metallica told Billboard that the band’s members were unaware of the practice, as the band had delegated the matter to a “ticketing consultant”.Live Nation said people associated with Metallica had decided to use the secondary market after realising how much money was being made from their concerts by touts, sometimes known as brokers within the ticketing industry.“In 2016, Metallica performed a single show in Minneapolis at which more than 10,000 tickets were transacted on the secondary market without the band’s participation,” said the spokesperson.“After seeing the volume of secondary transactions for that show and the benefit being captured by brokers, the independent consultant worked with Live Nation on a unique distribution strategy that used the secondary market as a sales distribution channel for select high-end tickets.”Fans and ticket industry sources have long suspected that bands, venues or promoters are leaking tickets directly on to the secondary market, forcing fans to pay more to see their favourite acts, but the allegation has been difficult to prove.Live Nation told Billboard that the Metallica tour was not the only time it had engaged in passing tickets directly to resale sites but said it only did so when musicians asked it to.It said that between 2016 and 2017, “about a dozen artists out of the thousands we work with asked us to do this”.Adam Webb of FanFair Alliance, which campaigns against industrial-scale online ticket touting, told the : “Thanks to the efforts of government, MPs, the Competition and Markets Authority, the Advertising Standards Authority – as well as many in the industry – the UK’s secondary ticketing market is becoming far more regulated.“For a start, it would be unlawful for an event organiser to put tickets directly on to the secondary market without making a clear disclosure. Even rogue operators like Viagogo are being forced to comply with the law. We’re not there yet, but the UK is making progress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

Famous for being the radical outrider to the more staid Vote Leave campaign, which ultimately won official status, Leave.EU has since been dogged by fines, police investigations and questions about its links to Russia.The latest ruling from the EU will still see the organisation lose its identity, however, unless it takes action. Organisations and undertakings must be based in the EU to qualify for the domain, but a new loophole, introduced last week after outcry from EU citizens based in the UK who feared they would lose their digital identity, allows for domain names registered in the name of an inidual to be kept regardless of residency, provided that inidual is an EU citizen.That means that all Leave.EU, or any other British organisation with a .eu domain, needs to do to keep its identity is hire an EU citizen, or find an employee who already qualifies for citizenship, and transfer ownership of the domain name to them.The UK government advice does not go so far as recommending businesses exploit the loophole, however. Instead, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp Sport recommends “that UK registrants continue to prepare for a no-deal scenario” by registering an alternative domain name and forwarding all requests to that new URL."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2947f3087a8292e14525d943b1f9811dd509e9c8/0_330_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7ff4422dedf1dc8fdd2a6461189a0e","title":"mystery of chedworth 1800 year old roman glass shard solved","story":"Find sheds fresh light on wealth and influence of ex-inhabitants of National Trust propertyA fragment from a Roman bottle so exceptionally rare that it has taken glass experts from around the world two years to conclusively identify it has been discovered thousands of miles from where it was made.The discovery at Chedworth Roman Villa in Gloucestershire of the small shard of patterned green glass, part of an 1,800-year-old fish bottle, has astonished archaeologists.Nothing like it has ever been found in Britain. It would have been made in an area around the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine and was possibly used to hold exotic perfume.For it to travel all the way from the Black Sea to the Cotswolds sheds new light on the wealth and influence of the people who occupied Chedworth, a National Trust property regarded as one of the grandest Roman villas in Britain.Nancy Grace, the National Trust archaeologist who led the work to investigate the find, said it had puzzled lots of people. “People have been enchanted by it, but it has also been a long and difficult journey,” she said. “To have found that it is the only one of its type so far discovered in Roman Britain adds to our knowledge of the importance of Chedworth Roman Villa.”It is known that the villa was home to somebody of wealth and status. The fabulously exotic fish bottle from so far away “underlines that the occupants were in touch with the furthest regions of the Roman Empire and wanted to show off that influence. It is amazing that a small fragment has told us so much.”The shard was found in the summer of 2017 but it has taken until now to identify the type of bottle is came from because of its rarity. It was sent to one of the leading experts in Roman glass, the late professor Jennifer Price, who in turn sought advice from other glass experts around the world.The distinctive profile of the glass indicated it came from a long bottle with an oval shape and a sharp taper at the end. Price eventually found it matched a restored fish-shaped bottle in the collection of the Corning Museum of Glass in New York.In an indication of its rarity, the only other example of a Roman fish bottle comes from a 2AD burial at Chersonesus in Crimea.Price died in May but Grace said she could tell how much she was enjoying solving the mystery of the Chedworth glass shard. And she solved it, with her research published in the latest edition of the specialist newsletter, Glass News.The fragment was found by Peter Moore, an archaeologist and masters student at the University of York who was helping with a dig at the villa. He said he would never forget the moment he found it, realising straight away it was something special.“Knowing that you are the first person to gaze upon it for at least 1,800 years is a feeling that never tires,” he said. “Recovering such a unique find is incredibly humbling.”The trust commissioned the archaeological illustrator Maggie Foottit to produce an impression of how the complete fish bottle may have looked.The fragment is going on display at the villa from Tuesday as part of the villa’s festival of archaeology and will remain on display throughout the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ccfcc48300254953530c8e890a9fa488dadbb8a/0_348_1903_1142/master/1903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3182cc9786d13c25bad70deda936c6de","title":"why nba stars like james harden and lebron james invest in football clubs","story":"Even though MLS clubs cannot compete with the other US sports leagues in terms of income, soccer is seen as a growing market for wealthy athlete-investorsJames Harden’s summer of soccer continues. Earlier this month, the 2018 NBA Most Valuable Player had a kickaround at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. And he was at NRG Stadium in Houston on Saturday, enjoying Bayern Munich’s 3-1 win over Real Madrid while his new club picked up three points in Toronto. Two days prior, the Houston Dynamo and Houston Dash announced that Harden has purchased a minority stake in the group that controls the MLS and NWSL clubs and their 22,000-capacity stadium.In simpler and less lucrative times, sports stars might have been content to open a memorabilia-filled steakhouse or bar in the cities where they became local legends. Now they are so wealthy – Harden’s salary for the coming season is $38m – that they have asset managers and strategic investment portfolios.Harden sees the Houston deal as a way to deepen his relationship with the city where he became a megastar while tapping into a growing league in the world’s biggest sport. “It was time,” Harden said in a message recorded in the Dynamo’s locker room. “I’m invested, this is my city and I’m here, I’m here to stay. I know I need to bring a championship in basketball and I will, that’s coming very, very soon, but I just had to show my appreciation and let you guys know that I’m a part of the city and I’m here forever, so I’m a part of the Dynamo, we’re going to take this thing to another level.”The deal is “another opportunity to expand my brand globally, over these last four or five years I became very passionate about soccer so it made perfect sense,” he told Fox local news on Saturday.Harden was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Houston Rockets in 2012, becoming the face (and the facial hair) of the franchise. He is not known to be a regular at Dynamo or Dash matches, but has long been a fan of the Fifa video game series, which helped deepen his interest in football. So has his link with Adidas – he met Paul Pogba at Old Trafford in 2016 on a marketing trip to Europe.The Houston deal has strong Californian links. The Dynamo’s majority owner is Gabriel Brener, a Mexico-born businessman whose investment company is based in Los Angeles. One of the other owners is Oscar De La Hoya, the former boxer, who, like Harden, was born in LA. Among Harden’s advisors is True Capital Management, a wealth management firm headquartered in San Francisco that has more than 200 current and former sportspeople as clients. The company helped set up a meeting.“Really it started with a get-together between the ownership group and him and just feeling out if there was a mutual connection to put a partnership together. They offered him the opportunity to invest in a minority position in the team and we were instrumental in the process of helping to pull the terms together,” Doug Raetz, the CEO of True Capital Management, told the . He declined to discuss the details of the agreement.Harden has earned more than $148m in wages during his decade in the NBA, while in 2017 he signed a then NBA-record $228m contract extension to the end of the 2022-23 season. Endorsements add significantly to his wealth: in 2015 he agreed a long-term shoe deal with Adidas worth a reported $200m. The Dynamo, meanwhile, have the lowest annual payroll in MLS, as of June – under $8m for the entire squad. It is easy to see why the Dynamo are excited about the potential for Harden’s star power to lift the club’s profile – he has 9.8m followers on Instagram and 6.3m on Twitter, dwarfing their own 423,000 and MLS’s 3.3m. Houston’s 3-1 win over Toronto FC on Saturday keeps them firmly in playoff contention, but their crowds have declined in recent seasons and the current average, 15,557, is 19th in the 24-team competition. That number looks especially modest given that Houston is the fifth-biggest metropolitan area in the US, with about seven million residents.With rising player wages but only four teams with average attendances over 25,000 so far this season and broadcast income still paltry by the standards of the top European leagues, it is hard for MLS teams to make an operating profit. But franchises are increasingly valuable, with demand so high that the league is charging new entrants a $200m expansion fee.Stadiums, like other pieces of real estate, can soar in value. And perhaps most importantly, MLS’s commercial arm, Soccer United Marketing, is likely to become even more powerful and profitable in the run-up to North America’s hosting of the 2026 World Cup.“MLS we believe has a huge future here in the US and we think it’s on the early runway of something very, very big. I think the trends of youth soccer are looking unbelievable and it’s early in the league’s history but the trend is going in the right direction and it’s being supported by the valuations that you’re starting to see in these various teams and the new franchise fees that are out there,” Raetz said.“A number of retired athletes have been around the space and have showed interest but for an active player like James to get involved I think is groundbreaking.”As LeBron James put it to the Wall Street Journal in 2011: “The first time I stepped on an NBA court I became a businessman.” Whether or not Harden’s MLS gambit pans out, there’s always the sports drinks, the skincare range and the socks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf3f5aa0b0ca7327c7b4962a2151c2e7e6a8e65/0_368_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5768ed8989c7a083492c801bfb0fc60c","title":"shane lowry wins open","story":"They were nervous at the 1st, and so was he. The ovation they gave Shane Lowry when he stepped out to begin the final round of the 148th Open soon settled down into an uneasy silence. Lowry is an anxious man. He has said it himself. Back in 2016 he got so stressed about organising the guest list for his wedding that he and his fiancée decided they were better off eloping to New York instead. It was later that same year he blew a four-shot lead in the last round of the US Open at Oakmont. Everyone remembered that one and, even if they had tried to forget it, Brooks Koepka, seven shots back, had made a point of reminding them what happened “the last time Shane had the lead” on Saturday night.And then Lowry flared his opening drive wide left into the ugly rough while his partner, and good pal, Tommy Fleetwood, whistled his straight down the middle. Fleetwood’s second was even better, and set up a 12ft putt for birdie. Lowry, on the other hand, lumped his into the cavernous front bunker, so deep that he disappeared into it. His escape shot looked, for a second, as though it would run on right up to the pin, but it caught on a ridge in the middle of the green and spun right back down the way it came. It left him needing to make a long putt for par, which he missed, and then a shorter one, from 8ft, just to make his bogey.The night before, in the moments after his magical 63, Lowry had tried to explain how his game had changed in the months since he missed the cut in the Open last year. It wasn’t what he was doing, he said, but the way he was doing it. “I play golf now like there’s no consequences,” he explained, “like, what’s the worst thing that can happen? If I swing the club here and hit the ball, no matter where it goes, what is the worst thing that can happen to you?” Well, as he stood over that bogey putt, facing up to the prospect of a two-shot swing, it felt like he was about to find out.Lowry needed this one. And when he got it, the crowd erupted around him. There can’t have been a bogey‑five that has ever been celebrated quite like it. In that moment Lowry had confronted the worst, come close enough to it to get a good look, and now he had faced it down. With that, everything began to turn around. He would not play so badly again all day – and Fleetwood would not get so close to his lead again, either.So four hours later, Lowry arrived on the 18th six shots clear, followed by the raucous thousands, who came in pell-mell behind him as the stewards dropped the ropes and let them flood on to the fairway to watch the big finish. It was not the largest crowd the Open has ever had – there was one bigger, at St Andrews in 2000 – but it was surely the loudest. But then they have been waiting for this a long time. This was the first time they have had the Open here in 68 years. It would have come sooner, but for the Troubles. And without stretching the point, it felt significant that the Open ended with all those Northern Irish fans cheering on a golfer from Offaly, the son of an All-Ireland title-winning Gaelic footballer, no less.They were generous to Fleetwood, too. They had been cheering them both on all day long, like it was a Ryder Cup tie. Fleetwood and Lowry are good friends, and they had been looking out for each other. They started the round with a firm hug, and finished it the same way. And when Fleetwood, utterly dejected, made his way on to the 18th green, Lowry’s caddie Bo Martin ordered all the merry Irish fans to pipe down their singing and chanting with a wave of his hand. They fell entirely quiet and let Fleetwood play out the last two strokes of his round, and gave him a loud round of applause when he had.The miracle was that there was so many of them there to watch, because by the middle of the afternoon the weather was so atrocious you could not necessarily have guessed where they were playing, or which part of the country it was in, since the town all around had disappeared into the low, black rainclouds that had blown in.All you knew was that it was clearly some place where the locals were so crazy about the game that they thought these were fit conditions in which to be out watching golf. Any place, were they sensible, they would all have been shut up indoors with the curtains drawn, but here there were plenty striding about in shirts and shorts.A lot of them did not even have tickets but were up on the sand dunes, or along the roads running over the nearby hills – there was, astonishingly, even someone bobbing about in the sea who seemed to be trying to film it all on his mobile phone. They filled every last spot where they could feasibly catch a glimpse of this unlikely victory. It was only last year that Lowry lost his PGA Tour card because he had had such a bad run, six missed cuts, and not so much as a single top‑10 finish. “I failed in America,” he said then. Back here at home, he has succeeded in the most brilliant fashion, and, for this one week at least, brought a lot of people here together to watch him do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6170529807a02fb4593c34e0a3f4b99503e48ff/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5939503d6dcb0e5591863215e30e899d","title":"blue hags and spanish booty the legends of mull","story":"Tales of witches and doomed pipers, plus the promise of hidden treasures beneath the waves, fuel a creative spirit on the Isle of Mull that expresses itself through music, art and whiskyVisitors to the Isle of Mull – Scotland’s fourth-biggest island – are mesmerised by its many treasures. Everyone who lives here – be they artists, musicians or whisky makers – lives in symbiosis with their surroundings, feeding off the folklore embedded in the island’s soul.The story of MacKinnon’s Cave, said to be one of the deepest sea caves in the Hebrides, will chill the heart of many a musician. A piper who was walking his dog in the cave came to a sticky end when a female ogre (or fairy, depending on your folklore source) became unimpressed with his performance. The dog survived, but emerged crazed and hairless with fright. Some claim to have seen the doomed bald canine walking along the top of the caves – and if you’re brave enough to go inside, his harrowing howls can apparently be heard whistling in the wind.Then there’s the ancient Lochbuie stone circle: nine granite rocks that sit silently in their own natural amphitheatre, overlooked by the slopes of Ben Buie. Although most visitors find it a place of tranquility, legend has it that the area is haunted.More chilling still is the tale of idyllic Loch Ba, reputed home to Cailleach Bheur, one of Scotland’s most powerful witches. Once every 100 years, before any other creature had awoken, the blue-faced old hag would submerge herself in the water of the loch, and be transformed into an enchanting beauty. The spell was broken by the bark of a dog who had awoken before she’d finished bathing. The witch, also known as the queen of winter, is said to have created the beautiful rolling hills on the isle by striding across the land and dropping rocks from her basket to form her own stepping stones.The sporadic appearance of valuable artefacts in Tobermory Bay, meanwhile, have convinced many that a sunken Spanish ship from 1588 – either the Florencia or the San Juan de Sicilia – lurks beneath the waves. Having fled the Channel in the wake of the Armada’s defeat, it’s thought to have sunk in the bay, taking its rumoured cargo of £300,000 of gold bullion – which would now fetch more than £30m – with it.There are more riches in the bay than Spanish booty, however. In a town built as a fishing port – that has since developed an acclaimed arts scene, with its own gallery and theatre group – one thing you can count on is fresh seafood the many quaint restaurants and pubs serve crustaceans that go from boat to plate in minutes.You could even be lucky enough to see dolphins, whales and basking sharks just off the shore. Golden and white-tailed eagles have also made this picturesque island their home, as have otters and an abundance of other birds and mammals.The island is also home to the famous Tobermory Distillery, established in 1798. One of Scotland’s oldest distilleries (and the only one on the island), it produces single malts with a captivating charm that are expressive by nature and inspired by the bright, Instagram-perfect buildings that line the waterfront.With its kaleidoscope of colour, culture, wildlife, eerie legends and fine local whisky, Mull could be the place for you to conjure up your own story.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers, visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

As Veep’s central character, Julia Louis-Dreyfus imbued vice-president Selina Meyer with a convincing mix of charm and barely concealed rage, and the show’s sharp dialogue and keen observations of Washington DC hypocrisy made it a must-watch.It wrung much of its humour from the impotence of the VP position, as in the pilot episode, where Selina’s speech about clean energy is censored by the president so it that won’t alienate any of his benefactors, leaving her with just “Hello … ” and prepositions.It also highlighted the challenges of being a woman in public life, with Selina aware that referencing her gender would lose her political points (as she told her staff: “I can’t identify myself as a woman, people can’t know that”). While Louis-Dreyfus’s performance was the star turn, the entire ensemble was stellar, including Tony Hale as Selina’s “body man” Gary, keeper of secrets and hand wipes and head of staff Amy (Anna Chlumsky), a coiled spring in human form.The show’s incisive writing was no surprise, considering it was created by Armando Iannucci, who had previously skewered Westminster politics in BBC comedy The Thick of It. It was when he left at the end of season four that Veep began its descent. It increasingly favoured innuendos and insults over clever commentary and doubled down on obnoxious characters who were best employed in moderation, such as Patton Oswalt’s political campaignersexual harasser Teddy Sykes and staffer Jonah Ryan (Tim Simons).Plus, the show lost sight of what made its lead character tick. The final season saw Selina – who briefly inherited the presidency in season three before losing it in a general election – fight and manipulate her way back to the Oval Office, and it was miserable to watch. Where previous storylines were rooted in the fact that she often had to compromise her ideals in order to keep her position (such as when she defended the importance of abortion access behind the scenes but spewed mealy-mouthed platitudes on breakfast television), now we saw her sabotage a Tibetan peace treaty, allow China to meddle in American democracy, and set up Gary as the patsy for her charitable foundation’s financial misdemeanours.It made sense that almost 30 years in politics might have made her cynical but it was hard to believe that even a politician whose ambitions were continually thwarted could be so awful. The flash-forward finale made things worse: not only did it kill off Selina but also America’s sweetheart Tom Hanks, a call back to a throwaway season one remark that no one needed to see played out.It cannot be easy to satirise politics in the age of Donald Trump, and perhaps his presidency calls for an approach entirely stripped of subtlety. But it was sad to see one of America’s best comedies become almost as crude as he is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b5d123da75b607df2e5d46e674649f83105b0c/229_0_4607_2764/master/4607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8251da346f04a99e7504c52243c34d90","title":"equifax data breach security ftc settlement","story":"Equifax will pay up to $700m to settle with the US and states over a 2017 data breach that exposed social security numbers and other private information of nearly 150m people.The settlement with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as 48 states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, would provide up to $425m in monetary relief to consumers, a $100m civil money penalty and other relief.The breach was one of the largest ever to threaten the private information. The consumer reporting agency, based in Atlanta, did not detect the attack for more than six weeks. Compromised data included social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver license numbers, credit card numbers and in some cases data from passports.Affected consumers may be eligible to receive money by filing one or more claims for conditions including money spent purchasing credit monitoring or identity theft protection after the breach and the cost of freezing or unfreezing credit reports at any consumer reporting agency.All affected consumers would be eligible to receive at least 10 years of free credit-monitoring, at least seven years of free identity restoration services and, starting on 31 December and extending seven years, all US consumers may request up to six free copies of their Equifax credit report during any 12-month period.If consumers choose not to enroll in the free credit monitoring product available through the settlement, they may seek up to $125 as a reimbursement for the cost of a credit-monitoring product of their choice. Consumers must submit a claim in order to receive free credit monitoring or cash reimbursements.“Companies that profit from personal information have an extra responsibility to protect and secure that data,” said the FTC chairman, Joe Simons.“Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers. This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud.”The announcement confirms a report by the Wall Street Journal that the credit reporting agency had reached a deal with the US.The company said earlier this year that it had set aside around $700m to cover anticipated settlements and fines.The settlement must still be approved by the federal district court in the northern district of Georgia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95dafa28053a301f224d23b9067ff0df79fcee29/0_292_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c227fef4809e49ce45ce09f30bd0e8","title":"if others have rifles well have rifles why leftist groups are taking up arms","story":"Armed antifascists groups say they want to protect events from other malicious and potentially armed groups – a phenomenon that is becoming more and more commonThe van lumbered down one of Seattle’s many steep hills. A half dozen people packed inside but despite the heat, most wore long pants and boots, and several sported black hoodies. The atmosphere was subdued, except for the occasional joke. It wasn’t so much tension as seriousness – there was work to be done.The people in the van are members of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club (PSJBGC). Their stated aim is to fight white supremacy and build community defense in America’s Pacific Northwest, and their presence has become a fixture of protests in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, where the group is often invited to provide security against rightwing aggression.The night before, several of them had been called to a library in nearby Renton, Washington, where a Drag Story Time Hour, an event series in which a local drag queen or drag king reads to children in a library or bookstore, was being disrupted by rightwing protesters. The protesters, who opposed the event as “immoral”, held up signs equating drag with pedophilia, and screamed “Shame! Shame!” at parents and their kids. Among them were members of the Proud Boys, a violent rightwing street gang, and Three Percenters militia, who were open-carrying firearms. The north-west has been at the center of tense political clashes over the last two years. The area is an adopted home base for far-right groups like Patriot Prayer, Identity EvropaAmerican Identity Movement and the Proud Boys, who have organized numerous marches that have ended in violence. In response, a range of leftist groups have organized self defence groups and, in doing so, present gun ownership as a way to protect themselves and others.Now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was en route to Seattle’s Trans Pride March.In the weeks prior, word spread that a number of white supremacist groups had planned to disrupt the celebration. Hearing this, the club reached out to the organizers of the event, the Gender Justice League, and offered to assist with security or to provide escorts.Brooke Wylie, the head of security for the Gender Justice League in charge of overseeing the 101-person security detail for the event, did some research on the club. She told them the event had a policy of having no open carry (that is, no visible weapon), which they were fine with. She accepted their offer. Police were also present, but many marginalized groups do not trust them to provide protection at public events, especially when far-right groups are involved.Each member showed up with a concealed handgun. “We do our actions proportional to the threat, so when other people are out with rifles, we’ll be out with rifles,” Nick, the group’s de facto spokesperson, explained. “In this case, we don’t want to appear threatening for the people that we’re trying to protect and support we want this to be a happy atmosphere, especially for a population that may have faced gun violence on the street just for being who they are.”This scenario – in which armed community groups are working together to patrol a Pride event and protect it from other malicious and potentially armed groups – is becoming more and more common. There are more guns than people in America – approximately 393 million in a country of 328 million people. An average of 34,501 people died each year from firearms in 2018, 992 of those deaths were the result of police shootings.And the memory of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, when 49 people were killed at a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida, is still hanging heavily over the LGBTQ community.Throughout the day, Puget Sound members stood watch oversections of the park, staying connected via walkie-talkies. “Thank you for being here!” was a common refrain from march-goers, as were inquiries on how to join (the group has a several-month long vetting process and probationary period for prospective recruits.)Unlike some of the other masked antifascist groups at the march that day, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club considers themselves to be an “aboveground” organization, and chooses not to cover their faces.“Part of the reason we don’t cover our faces is that we don’t want to present as though we are a militia,” Fozz, a longtime member, explained. “We are not. We want to build relationships with people in our community, we want to appear approachable.”While the group has not used deadly force, a former member of the group, Willem Van Spronsen, recently made headlines when he was killed by police after trying to set fire to Ice vehicles in a parking lot outside the Northwest Detention Center In Tacoma, Washington, a private immigration detainment facility.Washington state’s relatively loose gun laws mean that even those with minimal training are able to show up to public events armed, which has potentially lethal implications. At a Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of Washington in 2017, an antifascist protester was shot in the stomach by a Trump supporter named Elizabeth Hokoana, who then claimed self-defense if convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison.This is the context in which an armed community defense group has been invited to protect a trans pride event. The thinking goes that, since there are already guns everywhere, and the people who want to hurt minority groups are often heavily armed, their side may as well have guns, too.When asked about how they would react if a survivor of gun violence came up and confronted them about their decision to bring guns into a public protest space, the Puget Sound Club members say that they would approach the situation with empathy. A member named Seraphiad pointed to their own history with gun violence as a starting point.“The reason some people decide to carry is because they too have been victims of gun violence and other forms of violence,” they explained. “I would relate to them based on my own experience with violence and share my choice to protect myself.”For many other left-leaning organizations, guns remain a difficult topic. The second amendment has attained almost religious significance to some conservative gun owners, while gun control has become a defining issue for centrists and liberals, the opinions of those on the more radical left vary. The Democratic Socialists of America, for example, responded to an interview request for this piece by saying, “the DSA has no comment on gun controls or the second amendments. Our members represent a ersity of viewpoints on this topics.”Others have been more forthcoming. Patrick Blanchfield, the author of a forthcoming book on guns and the left called Gunpower, doesn’t specifically oppose the idea of armed self-defense, but he sees its as a potential danger to both the inidual as well as a broader group or community, referencing the government’s brutal assaults on the Black Panthers as a historical example.Blanchfield also sees an issue in the way armed groups have the potential to inadvertently replicate existing oppressive structures. “You don’t want to be the antifa cop,” he explains. “For example, I would need some convincing that armed leftists didn’t shoot partners at a rate substantially lower than non-leftists.”The Puget Sound chapter is part of a long American leftist tradition of armed groups, from the Black Panthers to current groups like Redneck Revolt, the Socialist Rifle Association, Trigger Warning Queer \u0026amp Trans Gun Club, and the Los Angeles Black Coyote Collective.Twenty one members turned up that day. Nick, Fozz and a member who goes by Reverend were joined by Kat, a diminutive, self-described “soccer mom” quiet, serious Vixen, with strawberry blonde hair and orange knee socks Duke, the group’s stocky, bearded founder and Shannon, a civil rights attorney and constitutional law professor.There are plenty of anarchists among their ranks, but there are also people like Shannon who feel strongly about the second amendment and who are more interested in working within existing frameworks than tearing them down.“There’s power in knowledge of the constitution,” she explains. “It’s okay to be a knowledgeable person whose politics are left of center, and be willing to understand and fight back with the legal framework.”Duke, a lifelong anarchist who founded the Seattle chapter in 2017, describes himself as having retired from activism following the birth of his son in 2012. He did “normal progressive Seattle dad” things like taking his family to Black Lives Matter and Fight for 15 rallies until 2017, when he was inspired to act following the election of Donald Trump – and more specifically, by the proliferation of hate crimes that plagued Seattle during its lead-up.“I really got active in John Brown Gun Club because there were swastikas in my kid’s park,” he says. “I knew a lot of people at that point who were organizing with Redneck Revolt across the country, so I was like, this is something I can do. So I formed this chapter, and members started flocking to us.”The rise of white supremacist violence since 2016 served as a flashpoint for many members’ decisions to arm themselves. Fozz, who is Jewish, told a story about sitting down with his wife after Trump’s election and deciding which of them was going to learn how to use a gun, “because we’re going to need it.”For others, it was the shock of violence at the fatal 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that sparked their interest in armed self-defense.For Vixen, the decision to join came from the threats right-wing extremism poses to her identity. A trans woman who grew up shooting guns off her front porch in Indiana, she spoke about the toxic culture she had encountered at many gun ranges, and of the obligation she felt to protect her queer community.“Today, I’m a trans woman at Trans Pride, so I feel like I’m personally able to step in front and put myself in front of people who are being attacked or harassed and just try to de-escalate the situation – which is always the goal,” she said. “Obviously, you don’t ever want to celebrate having to use force on someone, but completely throwing it away as an option is really self-defeating.”So far, none of the members have had to use their weapons in this context, and the hope expressed is that they never will.The day after the march, Kat, Nick, Duke, Reverend and Fozz gathered at a coffee shop to debrief. The club views gun control through a specifically leftist political lens. As Duke sees it, the root cause of American violence isn’t the guns themselves it’s inequality.“It comes out of not wanting to arm former slaves and people in poverty who are struggling and organizing, and so when we talk about gun control in America, what we really should be talking about is capital control. If you read the Dred Scott decision, there’s a line in there that says ‘We don’t want to grant citizenship because Black people might get guns,’ and I think that says an awful lot about America and gun control.”White privilege is something that is repeatedly brought up throughout the weekend (while there are people of color in the organization, the membership is majority white). Shannon says that, due to her “middle aged white lady veneer,” she knows she will be treated differently by police when she open carries at a protest.Fozz, a union organizer by trade, has been on suspension for the past four months after his involvement with the PSJBCG during his off hours was made the subject of an investigation at work. His supervisors identified a photo of him open carrying at a protest according to Fozz, the suspension was framed as a workplace safety issue because his bosses believe that he is capable of violence.“It’s very disappointing as well as deeply concerning that an organization like a labor union would actually be critical of someone that takes the time and resources and expenses to stand up to people that would attack its membership,” he says. “I asked them the question, why do you guys have such a problem with a Jew standing up to neo-Nazis that are threatening his neighborhood?”That weekend, none of the Proud Boys or other fascist provocateurs did show up to Trans Pride. For now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was off the clock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/151fd2a3f94b9ac395038d384e1e5213499ba490/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e431ba52012d5884a85a73bd79f7d0be","title":"china signs secret deal to station troops at cambodia naval base","story":"Wall Street Journal says US officials have seen pact but Cambodian PM denies moveChina has signed a secret deal to allow its military troops to be stationed at a naval base in Cambodia, according to reports.The Wall Street Journal, citing US officials who had seen a pact drawn up between the two countries, reported that the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, has agreed to give China access to the Ream naval base on the Gulf of Thailand.Fears that China intended to place troops in Cambodia, giving them enhanced access to the contested South China Sea and an unprecedented economic and territorial foothold in south-east Asia, have circulated for months.The prospect of a Chinese naval base in Cambodia was first raised in a letter from the US vice-president, Mike Pence, to Hun Sen in 2018 but was repeatedly dismissed by Hun Sen as “fake news”.After renewed reports on Sunday, the prime minister once again denied the story. “This is the worst ever made-up news against Cambodia,” he told the pro-government news site Fresh News on Monday. “No such thing could happen because hosting foreign military bases is against the Cambodian constitution.”However, Hun Sen’s independence from Beijing has increasingly been called into question. Over the past two years he has accepted more than $600m (£480m) in loans as part of China’s controversial Belt and Road initiative. China has also committed almost $2bn to build roads and bridges across Cambodia, with further infrastructure and multimillion-dollar business deals in the works, and given another $150m in aid.“If true, it’s further evidence of Cambodia falling deeper and deeper into China’s embrace,” said Sophal Ear, a prominent Cambodian political scientist. “It does not come as a surprise as speculation has mounted from US government sources and I don’t believe that kind of speculation is based on no evidence.”Sophal added: “It reveals that we’re in uncharted waters. Hun Sen needs China and China needs Hun Sen and Cambodians pay the price. It appears that there are massive strings attached to these loans. If Cambodia had said no, do you think China would continue its massive investment in Cambodia?”China’s Belt and Road initiative, worth $1tn and spreading across 70 countries, is supposedly about securing trade routes but there are increased concerns it is also a way for China to secure its military dominance across pivotal regions. It has already set up its first overseas military base in Djibouti.In a statement, the US state department urged Cambodia to reject any Chinese military presence on its sovereign soil, saying the nation had a “constitutional commitment to its people to pursue an independent foreign policy”.“We are concerned that any steps by the Cambodian government to invite a foreign military presence in Cambodia would threaten the coherence and centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in coordinating regional developments, and disturb peace and stability in south-east Asia,” the statement added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f280548f98231175f894b9d358a38368bebf2791/40_50_2434_1460/master/2434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d3051ad7a2f7ae40f25788dd6bb487","title":"french submarine minerve found 50 years after disappearance","story":"La Minerve, which vanished in 1968 with 52 sailors on board, discovered off ToulonThe French navy has located one of its submarines that disappeared more than 50 years ago with 52 crew on board.La Minerve was discovered on the seabed in the Mediterranean off the port of Toulon.“It’s a success, a relief and a technical feat,” Florence Parly, the defence minister, tweeted. “I am thinking of the families who have waited for so long for this moment.”La Minerve was on a military exercise when it disappeared on 17 January 1968. Repeated searches have failed to find the vessel until now.Under pressure from relatives of crew members, a fresh search was launched at the beginning of this year using the latest hi-tech equipment to map and model tides and currents in the Mediterranean. Data from the time of the accident was also re-examined. This included seismic reports that suggested the submarine probably imploded as it dropped to the bottom of the sea.A senior French naval officer told Agence France-Presse the submarine was discovered by a boat belonging to the private US company Ocean Infinity. It announced it had found La Minerve at a depth of 2,370 metres, 27 miles (45km) from Toulon, which is home to a French naval base.The cause of the accident that led to the submarine sinking in just four minutes has never been established. Families hope the wreckage will provide long-awaited answers.The son of La Minerve’s commander, André Fauve, said it was a moment of “great emotion” for the families of the submariners who perished. “Many people told me they were supporting me during the search because they didn’t want me to feel alone but they didn’t believe it would be found,” Hervé Fauve told Le Monde.François Meunier, whose brother of Marc was a quartermaster on La Minerve, said: “It’s the end of a long wait and many questions.”The submarine, which had reportedly broken into three pieces, was located by Ocean Infinity’s search ship the Seabed Constructor, which arrived off the French coast five days ago. Using underwater drones, it found the wreckage on Sunday, helped by the fact that La Minerve had sunk in an area of low sedimentation. The first three letters of the vessel’s name were clearly visible on one piece of wreckage.Initial reports suggested the submarine may have had rudder problems before sinking. It was engaged in an exercise with a military aircraft when it disappeared at about 7.55am. The alarm was raised when it failed to return to its base the following day. About 20 boats, helicopters, aircraft and even a ing vessel used by the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau were involved but the search was fruitless.In 2018, the Seabed Constructor found the San Juan submarine that sank in the Atlantic off the coast of Argentina."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4838b130d61913c01544f27ac42aa4dac04f7690/0_1_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef1054014ece5d83e11addec95a2da48","title":"indias chandrayaan 2 moon mission lifts off a week after aborted launch","story":"With first mission to land on lunar south pole, India aims to join club comprising Russia, US and ChinaIndia’s mission to the moon has blasted into space one week after a technical glitch forced scientists to abruptly halt its scheduled launch.Thousands gathered to watch Chandrayaan-2 take off at 2.43pm local time (0913 GMT) on Monday from Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, north of Chennai. Last Monday, the unmanned mission was aborted 56 minutes from takeoff. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) blamed a “technical snag”. Indian media later reported that scientists had found a leak while filling helium in the rocket’s cryogenic engine.In a speech after the launch, Kailasavaoo Sivan, chairman of Isro, said the agency’s staff had worked tirelessly to fix the fault and had “bounced back with flying colours”.“It is the beginning of a historical journey of India towards the moon, and to land at a place near the south pole to carry out scientific experiments to explore the unexplored,” said Sivan.Scientists in the control room applauded as the spacecraft launched into space. It will spend 23 days in the Earth’s orbit, before beginning a series of manoeuvres that will take it into lunar orbit.With India poised to become the world’s fifth-largest economy, Narendra Modi’s ardently nationalist government is eager to show off the country’s prowess in security and technology.It was, he added, a “fully indigenous” project, using Indian technology.Chandrayaan-2 aims to become the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the lunar south pole region, where it will collect crucial information about the moon’s composition. It would be India’s first surface landing on the moon – a feat previously achieved by only Russia, the US and China.The $141m (£113m) mission is a “demonstration of the growing sophistication of India’s space power”, said Dr Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, head of the nuclear and space policy initiative at the Observer Research Foundation thinktank in Delhi.India launched its first lunar probe in 2008, and guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars in 2014. Its space programmes are famously thrifty, and its Mars mission, Modi has joked, had a smaller budget than that of the film Gravity.India’s achievements in space have been hailed by Modi as a mark of the country’s rising ambition as a global power. In March, he announced that the country had successfully shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. Though celebrated by Modi as a breakthrough for India’s national security, the missile test was criticised by Nasa for creating hundreds of pieces of orbital debris and threatening astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS).The launch of Chandrayaan-2 follows the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and comes amid renewed interest in returning to the moon among states and private industry. In January China landed the Chang’e 4 spacecraft on the previously unexplored far side of the moon, while in April the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure. Donald Trump has also said he wants to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024.Chandrayaan-2 – Sanskrit for “moon craft” – is India’s most ambitious space mission yet. Its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, helped to confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did so without landing on the lunar surface. Sivan said carrying out a soft landing would be “15 terrifying minutes”.At the forefront of the Chandrayaan-2 mission are two women. Its project director, Muthayya Vanitha, an electronics system engineer, was named by the science journal Nature as one of five scientists to watch in 2019. It is also being navigated by Ritu Karidhal, who helped to lead India’s Mars mission in 2014. It will take more than six weeks to travel about 238,600 miles (384,000km) to the moon. The four-tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter, a lander named Vikram after the founder of Isro, and a rover. The rover, named Pragyan, which means “wisdom” in Sanskrit, will spend two weeks traversing the moon’s surface. The six-wheeled vehicle, which will be deployed in early September, will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface, and search for water.The lunar south pole is interesting to scientists because they believe water may be present on its vast shadowed areas. The lunar south pole also has craters that are cold traps and which contain a fossil record of the early solar system, according to Isro.As well as Chandrayaan-2, India has said it aims to send three astronauts into space by 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11da9e3b2c2d8400e8e0ce33d1b69d67cfe2411c/0_186_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c980df82d9a203fdc71d3d033d6a8a","title":"six months on juan guaido supporters hang on to fading hope in venezuela","story":"Fresh protests to mark half a year after he declared himself interim leader, but Nicolás Maduro remains in powerSol Castro Sánchez was a picture of elation as she took to the streets of Caracas in the days after Juan Guaidó launched his dramatic bid to topple Nicolás Maduro on 23 January.“I guess this is what people in Germany felt in 1989 when the wall came down,” the retired professor enthused as she marched through Venezuela’s capital with tens of thousands of jubilant protesters and a homemade placard that read: “Enough is enough! We want them out!”Six months later, that excitement – and with it Castro’s conviction that change is nigh – is fading.“At that time, I felt you could reach out and you could grasp it,” the 63-year-old caraqueña admitted this week. “I don’t have that feeling any more.”When Guaidó declared himself Venezuela’s rightful interim leader on 23 January – and was recognised by dozens of foreign governments, including Britain and the US – the young opposition leader and his backers believed Maduro would fall within days.But half a year later, a massive show of domestic dissent and international pressure has failed to dislodge Hugo Chávez’s unpopular successor.“This was a very high stakes gamble … and it hasn’t really paid off,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group and author of a  report on possible solutions to Venezuela’s crisis. “Plan A has certainly not worked.”That reality has forced Venezuela’s opposition to begin exploring alternatives, particularly after a botched bid to spark a military uprising on 30 April.This month, Guaidó and Maduro representatives met on the Caribbean island of Barbados for the latest round of talks optimists hope could lead to free presidential elections in 2020, but which pessimists dismiss as a stalling tactic from Venezuela’s wily authoritarian leader.Guaidó, meanwhile, has busied himself touring his crisis-stricken country – he has visited 13 of Venezuela’s 23 states since January – in an effort to keep his campaign alive.“We are getting close to a real solution,” he claimed last week.Some have already given up on the 35-year-old politician, amid reports that even Donald Trump – Guaidó’s key backer – is losing interest in his crusade.The commitment of another crucial regional supporter, Jair Bolsonaro, is also in doubt, after Brazil’s far-right president recently dropped a mention of Guaidó from a speech for fear of upsetting Russia’s Vladimir Putin who, along with China’s Xi Jinping, continues to support Maduro. (On Friday, Bolsonaro said he hoped Russia would “help resolve the Venezuela question”.)Rengifo – who lives in a hotel near the border town of Cúcuta with hundreds of other stranded defectors – said it was time to up the ante. He hoped a more radical leader, María Corina Machado, could take the lead in toppling Maduro.“Guaidó can keep calling protests but people have stopped caring,” he said.Valentina Landaeta, a 23-year-old businesswoman who joined pro-Guaidó protests at the start of the year, said she had also lost faith. “Probably we are not going to have change,” she conceded. “It’s a little sad. We put our hopes in him.”In February, Landaeta recalled feeling sure Venezuela was entering a new era. “We were wrong,” she said.But Castro, who has continued to attend Guaidó’s dwindling demonstrations, rejected such pessimism and said she still saw him as the only person capable of defeating Maduro. “It has to be Guaidó,” she said.Of Guaidó’s doubters, Castro complained: “We love heroes. But once they are defeated, or perceived as defeated, we throw them in the trash. It happened to Henrique Capriles. It happened to Leopoldo López,” she said of two other prominent opposition leaders who have tried – and failed – to defeat Chavismo. “And I feel it has happened with Guaidó.”Juan Andrés Mejía, a close Guaidó ally, said he understood public frustration and accepted there was “always a risk” the international community would be distracted by crises such as Iran.“Obviously people are anxious, people are desperate … But it is wrong to say that all is lost,” Mejía insisted, claiming “huge progress” since January.“We all wanted this to end sooner. But we are dealing with a dictatorship that kills, that tortures, that robs,” added Mejía, forced underground by a crackdown on opposition politicians supposedly involved in April’s failed insurrection. “Defeating such an opponent is much harder to do than most people may believe.”Gunson agreed there were things for Guaidó’s camp to celebrate even though January’s “fervour” had fizzled.Guaidó – who on Tuesday will mark six months since his challenge with fresh protests – has retained widespread support. Venezuela’s notoriously fractious opposition has yet to fall apart, despite constant “sniping from the wings” from more hardline rivals.Maduro remains in power but is weakened – to the extent that it was conceivable the military might “elbow him aside” and replace him with a junta, Gunson said.But if talks come to nothing, Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian catastrophe would worsen and the future would be bleak. “There is a real danger this could escalate into some kind of long-term low-intensity armed conflict within Venezuela,” Gunson warned.As her long wait for a brighter future drags on, Castro said she sought solace in the past. “History tells you that this is not going to last for ever. It is not going to last 100 years,” she insisted. “I know it’s going to end – sooner or later it will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd86b9e1e8d9b36daceca42e3669dad4c812e09/0_126_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7023a858b1295b29b9257470a9b26a27","title":"uk must look after its own ships in the gulf says pompeo","story":"US secretary of state’s comment reflects tensions with UK over Iran nuclear dealThe UK must be responsible for the safety of its own ships in the Gulf, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said.His remarks reflect unresolved tensions between Britain and the US over Donald Trump’s plans for a US-led military convoy to protect international shipping operating off the Iranian coast.Speaking on Fox News, Pompeo said: “The responsibility in the first instance falls to the United Kingdom to take care of their ships. The US has a responsibility to do its part.” British ministers discussed the issue at a Cobra emergency meeting that largely focused on how to respond to the Iranian capture on Friday of the British-flagged Stena Impero. The ship, crewed largely by Indian nationals, is being held in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. All crew members are in good health and still onboard, the Iran embassy in India said on Monday.The detention comes at a time of high tension in the region, with US, British and Iranian forces facing off at sea.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke to his German and French counterparts on Sunday to urge them to recognise the need to internationalise the maritime security operation in the Gulf. A multinational task force already exists, and it is not clear what the US believes its proposed Operation Sentinel will add.A spokesman for the prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We already work closely with international partners to ensure a co-ordinated effort to defend freedom of navigation … The high volume of ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz – up to 30 ships covering more than 100 nautical miles – makes it impossible to escort vessels inidually”.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone.

Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDonald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats \u0027attempted to impede\u0027 a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.About a fifth of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, the busiest shipping lane in the world for crude tankers, and it is less than 25 miles (40km) wide at its narrowest point. Tensions in the Gulf had already affected oil trading, and Friday’s tanker seizures caused prices to rise.Britain has concerns that a US-led maritime security operation may have a different emphasis since Trump wants Europeans to join the US in pulling out of the nuclear deal signed in 2015.The UK has already advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz until the crisis is resolved. There are eight British-flagged ships in the region at present.In a statement to MPs on Monday, Hunt will vigorously defend the British decision to seize an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar on 4 July, insisting Britain – in co-operation with the US – had established that the ship entered British waters and was bound for Syria in breach of EU sanctions.Iran says it is not party to EU sanctions on Syria, and points out that no ship previously heading for Syria has been impounded in this way. Iran claims the UK has in effect ended up supporting the US efforts to impose an Iranian oil export ban, a measure that the UK formally opposes as a supporter of the 2015 nuclear deal.The UK Foreign Office is aware that the advent of the pro-US Boris Johnson as prime minister may see a change in UK policy towards the deal, or at least to the idea of a US-led maritime security convoy, but at present diplomats remain committed to the long-established European policy of protecting the deal.There is an urgency about the security of British ships, since one option is for British-flagged ships to be reflagged to avoid them becoming a target of the Iranians, something that would deal a blow to the British shipping industry.There are about 4,500 ships registered with Britain or its overseas territories.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Lord Lamont, the former chancellor, and head of the British-Iranian chamber of commerce, said Britain must resist the temptation to get drawn closer to the US. “More armed escorts are not going to solve the situation,” he said. “The risk of a loss of life is very high and then you will get a proper shooting war.” The Iranians will have seen the capture of the Stena as offsetting the interdiction of the Iranian tanker, he added.Pompeo also dismissed Iran’s announcement that it had captured 17 spies working for the US Central Intelligence Agency and sentenced some to death.Iran made the announcement in state media, saying the alleged spies had been arrested in the 12 months to March 2019. Such announcements are not unusual in Iran, but the timing has raised concerns that Tehran is hardening its position in its standoff with western powers. “The Iranian regime has a long history of lying ... I would take with a significant grain of salt any Iranian assertion about actions that they’ve taken,” Pompeo said. Donald Trump likewise tweeted that the Iranian claim was “totally false”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Teenage victim later gave birth to child that DNA tests found was fathered by accused (37)Dublin teenager accused of stealing mother\u0026rsquos car remanded on continuing bailT\u0026aacutenaiste says British government will focus on getting Stormont back up and runningMan in his 70s transferred to Beaumont and treated for head injury after being hit by carOwner of miniature chihuahua Gizmo issues appeal after seeing him carried away by gullCommon toad named Trevor becomes face of herpetological society campaignThree others taken to hospital following Sunday night crash in OmaghOwner expresses relief after he captures marsupial near Kilworth villageBrief warm spell could see highs of up to 28 degrees in some areas, says Met \u0026EacuteireannBar Council calls for \u0026lsquorape myths\u0026rsquo to be combated in its submission to review bodyFarmer Thomas McKeown says campaign will be a much-needed shot in the arm for the industryManagement at service provider for people with disabilities told HSE of \u0026lsquolegacy\u0026rsquo practicesBord Bia study reveals millennials buy potatoes \u0026lsquofar less\u0026rsquo than rest of the populationEvolution of soft drinks and their sweetening content may explain shortfall in tax yieldTipperary council seeks removal of unofficial site as condition of deal to house six familiesAn audit will value memorabilia relating to Beckett, Swift, Bram Stoker and many othersDublin City Council has lodged planning application for two southside sitesCockroaches were found in \u0026lsquoclothes and food\u0026rsquo, according to one complainantBuilding will be in a compound in Abuja with embassies from other EU countries"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3963673.1563779503!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork s wandering wallaby dora home safe and sound","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDora the Explorer - the wandering wallaby - is home safe and sound after being found near Kilworth village in North Cork.Dora the Explorer - the wandering wallaby - is home safe and sound after being found near Kilworth village in North Cork early this morning.Dora’s owner Andrew Boyle, who runs Araglin Animal Centre from where Dora escaped last week, spoke this morning of his relief that the three-year-old female marsupial was found safe and well.“I got a call at six o’clock this morning from this guy, Eoin Hislop who spotted her near Kilworth, just outside of the village and fair play, he stood with her until I got there,” said Mr Boyle.“She was in the front garden of a house so I pulled up the van right across the driveway to block - so my wife, Annabel and myself went in to try and catch her and it was good because she was in a garden.“She was in behind bushes so I got down on my knees and crawled in and Annabel went around the other side of the bush and we tackled her very calmly and Annabel actually caught her by the tail“I had an empty feed back in the back of the van so I just stuck that over her head and kept her calm and I sat in next to her in the back seat as we came back here to the sanctuary.”Mr Boyle praised Mr Hislop not just for contacting him but following his advice to anyone who saw the animal to stay with her and keep her in sight until he arrived at the scene.“She’s safe and sound and has no injuries, which is brilliant because if she had any injuries, even a little scratch, it could prove fatal - she had loads and loads to eat so she wasn’t undernourished in any way.”Mr Boyle thinks Dora escaped from Araglin Animal Sanctuary early last week when he and his wife were away for a few days as he discovered she was missing on their return on Thursday.But she was already making her presence felt with taxi driver, Noel Smith, hardly believing his eyes when he spotted her hopping along the roads at Mountain Barracks near Kilworth around 5.30am on Friday.Mr Smith filmed Dora to prove to everyone that he had seen a kangaroo or wallaby and reported the matter to Fermoy gardaí who issued an appeal to anyone who saw the animal to contact them.Mr Boyle then issued an appeal and explained Dora would not have any great road sense so he was concerned that she might be injured by a passing car or possibly injure herself when trying to flee from people.“Stress would be the big worry but she’s absolutely fine- the rest of the mob - the other wallabies here - hardly noticed her coming back into the enclosure but she’s absolutely normal so all’s well that ends well.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: It\u0026#39s time for a bonfire of the regulatory quangos that are destroying our democracySir Alan Duncan\u0026#39s long campaign to destroy the career of Boris Johnson Tory leadership latest: Sir Alan Duncan resigns as foreign minister, saying Brexit cast a \u0026#39dark cloud\u0026#39 over UKNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe back in prison after \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 of mental health wardSchool which changed uniform policy to make outfit \u0026#39gender neutral\u0026#39 now faces legal challenge from parents who say it discriminates against girls Comment: Is Ireland really about to \u0026#39cave in\u0026#39 to Boris over the backstop?Carl Beech aka Nick found guilty of making up Westminster VIP paedophile ringPaedophile Carl Beech and his web of lies about the Westminster sex abuse ringRussian oligarchs in Britain scrutinised by US investigation into election meddlingUS says it is up to UK to take care of its own ships in sign of disunity over Iran tanker crisisIsraeli crews demolish Palestinian homes in major operation in east Jerusalem\u0026#39Professional\u0026#39 fly tippers hunted by council after 50ft pile of rubbish appears on public footpath overnightWetherspoons becomes first business to ditch paper receipts as they say practice is outdatedIs it safe to visit Hong Kong?Comment: The Left are abusing the English language in their attempt to make \u0026#39Right-wing\u0026#39 synonymous with \u0026#39racist\u0026#39Reformist president\u0026#39s new party set to win majority in Ukraine\u0026#39s parliamentPrisoner escaped from hospital bed after he asked officers to get him a cup of coffee and a biscuitLeft-Handers Day 2019: The history behind the celebration and 13 facts about the wonderful leftVolvo recalls 70,000 UK cars over fault that can cause engine fireCharlie Elphicke MP charged with three counts of sexual assaultNumber of overweight children rises by a fifth because of lazy summer holidays spent staring at screens We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"music photographer denis oregancaptures glamour rock n roll","story":"As one of Britain’s top rock photographers over the past 45 years, Denis O’Regan has collaborated with legendary artists including David Bowie, Queen and the Rolling Stones, creating iconic images and capturing both the grit and the glamour of rock star life.

fly tippers hunted council 50ft pile rubbish appears","story":"A cyclists tries to get past the rubbish that was dumped in Stockport on Friday A local council is on the hunt for professional fly tippers who have left 50ft long pile of rubbish on a public footpath. Furious residents slammed the disgusting fly-tippers who have left the public pathway impassable due to the enormous mound of waste, which stands 12ft high. The rubbish appeared in the early hours of Friday morning and includes electrical cables, plugs, circuit boards, children\u0027s toys and even corporate waste.One container labelled highly flammable was pictured lying in the litter, which appears to have been compacted.It\u0027s thought the mess was dumped out of a HGV between 12.40am and 1.40am on Friday on a pathway in Stockport called the Fallowfield Loop.A nearby resident, who didn’t wish to be named, noticed the mound the following day when he took his dog for a walk.He said: I have walked down here everyday for years and I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. I was completely shocked when I saw, there is such a huge amount of rubbish.Local residents walk past the huge pile of rubbishTo be honest it\u0027s absolutely disgusting. To dump your rubbish anywhere but a tip is wrong, but to do it on a pathway that\u0027s used by the public is awful.” He said people would now have to be cautious when letting their dogs near the rubbish for fear of what has been dumped and added that it wasn’t just “a few blokes in their cars” but “an entire lorry full of rubbish”.He said: You can tell that it\u0027s been dumped here by some sort of professional waste disposal outfit.The council need to put concrete barriers up to stop vehicles coming down and prevent this ever happening again.Stockport Council’s website directs residents wishing to go to a recycling centre to Recycle for Greater Manchester where business waste has a minimum charge of almost £80. Business waste includes any waste that comes from construction, demolition, industry and agriculture. Lamps are charged 98p whilst the minimum charge for wood is £47.67.  Last week, an analysis by The  found some 47 local authorities now insist on payments.  The rubbish dumped on Friday night in Stockport Joe Paxton of the Reddish Walk Ride group which encourages better spaces for people in Stockport to cycle and walk more said: “It\u0027s not particular to Stockport - I think people will always try to get away with it, but councils clobbered by austerity now no longer do large refuse collections for free which won\u0027t help the situation. “This case, though, is an industrial one - it\u0027s not a man and a van dumping a few bits.” The incident was reported to Greater Manchester Police, Stockport politan Borough Council and the Environment Agency.Authorities hope CCTV footage will help uncover who is responsible.Cllr Sheila Bailey, Stockport Council’s Cabinet Member for Sustainable Stockport said: “We are extremely disappointed to hear of the fly-tipping incident near the entrance to the Fallowfield Loop in Reddish. “Due to the scale of this incident we are liaising with the regulating body who are the Environment Agency, and it has been raised to them- incident number 1720348.” “We have already gathered evidence and will be working with the EA in their investigations to help bring this horrible act and serious criminal offence to justice. Stockport Council confirmed that trade waste includes non-household goods, and said there were many reputable companies providing trade waste collection services.  They added that trade waste could be taken to the Suez facility at Longley Lane for recycling andor disposal at a charge.Comment: It\u0026#39s time for a bonfire of the regulatory quangos that are destroying our democracySir Alan Duncan\u0026#39s long

oligarchs britain scrutinised us investigation election","story":"Investigators say they are interested in interviewing alleged associates of Russian oligarch Oleg DeripaskaUS Senators investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election are renewing their focus on the activities of Russian oligarchs based in Britain.US congressional investigators say they are particularly interested in interviewing alleged associates of Russian Oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who is known to have close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.As part of its ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign, the US Senate Intelligence Committee has now written a formal letter to a London-based security consultant requesting his presence in Washington to give evidence.In the letter, a copy of which has been seen by The , the bipartisan committee of US Senators wants British-based security consultant Walter Soriano to attend a special closed session in Washington to answer questions about his alleged association with Mr Deripaska, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, as well as other key figures named in its Russian investigation.The committee also expressed an interest in Mr Soriano’s possible links with two former MI6 officers, Christopher Steele and Christopher Burrows, who were responsible for producing a highly damaging “dossier” on US President Donald Trump’s alleged ties with Russia.Mr Soriano is an Israeli cyber security consultant whose company USG Security Ltd has offices in London next door to Orbis Business Intelligence, which is run by Mr Steele and Mr Burrows.The committee has asked Mr Soriano to give oral evidence in Washington as well as producing “all documents and records, including hard copies or electronically stored information” relating to any dealings he may have had with a number of key figures in its Russia investigation.These include Mr Deripaska “or any of his employees or associates” as well as “Orbis Business Intelligence, or any of its employees or associates, including but not limited to Christopher Steele and Christopher Burrows”.Senators have also asked Mr Soriano to provide material relating to any dealings he has had with other key figures in their two-year investigation into Russian meddling. These include Paul Manafort, a former key aide of Mr Trump who is serving a seven-year jail term for fraud, Michael Flynn, the Trump administration’s first National Security Advisor, and Victor Boyarkin, a former officer in Russia’s GRU intelligence service who works for one of Mr Deripaska’s network of companies and is now subject to US sanctions.US investigators say the decision to summon Mr Soriano to Washington is a significant step in their attempts to understand the activities of Russian oligarchs linked to Mr Putin in Britain.“We are making progress with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and we are keen to talk to anyone who may have knowledge of what transpired during that time,” commented a senior US official.Mr Soriano, who is little-known in Britain and is understood to be an Israeli citizen, is a controversial figure in Israel, where he has been accused in the Israeli media of spying on police officers involved in the corruption probe into Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, charges he denies.

Please, please, please, anyone finds a chihuahua he\u0027s mine, a seagull took him from my garden, she wrote.Ms Hill said her six-year-old daughter is really upset and missing her dog.Experts have been drafted in as the search for the pet continues, and neighbours have been checking their roofs and gardens.UAV lost dog search and rescue who have been helping the family said on Sunday night: “Search for this evening has been called off.A lot of gardens have been checked and cleared along with rooftops, garage roofs and trees.“Leaflets will be distributed tomorrow in these areas for those who do not use social media.“Thank you so much to everyone who has helped or allowed to look around gardens today and are very appreciative of your support for the family of Gizmo.Tony Whitehead, a gull expert at the RSPB, told The  that this was a rare thing to happen, adding: I have come across gulls attacking dogs before, but it is incredibly rare.There are two things that could have caused this, the first one is that there\u0027s been a young gull recently fledged landing in an enclosed back garden where the dog is, and there\u0027s been some conflict, so the parents will have swept down to remove the bird.It\u0027s possible it\u0027s simply predation. Gulls are great opportunists, they aren\u0027t going to distinguish between a particularly small dog and a small bird.What I would say is, especially at this time of year where adult birds are particularly protective of their youngsters, if you have a very small dog, keep an eye on it, especially if you know you have gulls nesting on your roof or your neighbour\u0027s roof.Peter Rock, an ornithologist at the University of Bristol has warned owners of tiny dogs to not let them run around in the garden unattended.He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: These gulls are very large and as you know, if you\u0027ve been around gulls, you\u0027ll know they\u0027re very large and are quite capable of picking up small animals, quite commonly they will kill pigeons that look a little bit under the weather.It brings me back to that story a long time ago about poor little Roo in Cornwall who got attacked by herring gulls.He said that he has seen gulls rip the innards out of fully-grown mallards, and that small dogs could be at risk.Mr Rock added:  If you have a very tiny little dog I suggest you don\u0027t let it run around on your garden as it might well become a meal. It would have to be very tiny like this one was.There are several recorded incidents of seagulls attacking small dogs. The problem seems particularly rife in Devon in May 2015 Niki Wayne, 57, who lives nearby watched in shock as her chihuahua was pecked to death by ruthless gulls. As her owner took a shower, Bella managed to nudge open a slightly ajar door and run outside, where she was killed by gulls. An RSPB spokesman said: This must be extremely upsetting for the dog\u0027s owner. Fortunately these types of incidents are very rare and not typical gull behaviour.It is not currently legal to shoot a gull which is threatening or harming a pet. Those who feel they have a case can apply to Natural England for a licence, but it takes around 30 days for a licence to be issued if the application is approved.Some have called for pest birds to be killed if they are causing nuisance or hurting a family pet.Tim Bonner, Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance said “All humane options need to remain on the table when it comes to wildlife management especially when there are cases such as this that show a direct conflict with humans.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Customers can still request them but will not be given them as a matter of course.British retailers hand out 11.2 billion receipts - 7,300 tonnes - every year at a cost of £32m. Most end up in landfill because they cannot be recycled.Shops are gradually reducing their use of paper. Clothes stores including Topshop, Urban Outfitters, Gap, Clarks, New Look, Mothercare and motoring store Halfords have all begun offering e-receipts at an alternative in recent years.Many shopping receipts also cannot be recycled because they are printed on shiny paper and contain other substances.  In the chain\u0027s latest magazine, one wrote in, asking Tim Martin where they had gone. Stephen Simpson, of Keighley, West Yorks, said: I am wondering why you have stopped issuing receipts for meals at your pubs.Twice now, I have ordered meals with side orders as extras both times the side orders never arrived, leaving me wondering whether I had ordered them in the first place.With a receipt I would be able to see exactly what I ordered and show the staff exactly what may be missing.Tim Martin replied: We no longer issue receipts as a matter of course however, if you ask a member of staff, you can get one this way.Andrew Cregan, Payments Policy Advisor at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed Wetherspoons going receipt-free.He said: Many retailers continue to offer customers a paper receipt by default, but there are a growing number that seek to minimise their carbon footprint and cost for their customers through digital receipts or receipts on request, and more customers are opting for digital receipts as a more robust format in case items need to be returned.A spokesman for Wetherspoons said: We stopped because it created a mess at the bar, was a hassle for the pub teams plus it was a waste of paper and money as the customers didn\u0027t really want them either.Comment: It\u0026#39s time for a bonfire of the regulatory quangos that are destroying our democracySir Alan Duncan\u0026#39s long campaign to destroy the career of Boris Johnson Tory leadership latest: Sir Alan Duncan resigns as foreign minister, saying Brexit cast a \u0026#39dark cloud\u0026#39 over UKNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe back in prison after \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 of mental health wardSchool which changed uniform policy to make outfit \u0026#39gender neutral\u0026#39 now faces legal challenge from parents who say it discriminates against girls Comment: Is Ireland really about to \u0026#39cave in\u0026#39 to Boris over the backstop?Carl Beech aka Nick found guilty of making up Westminster VIP paedophile ringPaedophile Carl Beech and his web of lies about the Westminster sex abuse ringRussian oligarchs in Britain scrutinised by US investigation into election meddlingUS says it is up to UK to take care of its own ships in sign of disunity over Iran tanker crisisIsraeli crews demolish Palestinian homes in major operation in east Jerusalem\u0026#39Professional\u0026#39 fly tippers hunted by council after 50ft pile of rubbish appears on public footpath overnightIs it safe to visit Hong Kong?Comment: The Left are abusing the English language in their attempt to make \u0026#39Right-wing\u0026#39 synonymous with \u0026#39racist\u0026#39Reformist president\u0026#39s new party set to win majority in Ukraine\u0026#39s parliamentPrisoner escaped from hospital bed after he asked officers to get him a cup of coffee and a biscuitLeft-Handers Day 2019: The history behind the celebration and 13 facts about the wonderful leftVolvo recalls 70,000 UK cars over fault that can cause engine fireCharlie Elphicke MP charged with three counts of sexual assaultNumber of overweight children rises by a fifth because of lazy summer holidays spent staring at screens India launches Chandrayaan spacecraft in bid to become fourth country on the Moon We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/10/17/job-stats.jpg","title":"brexit businesses latest uk economy no deal","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsFirms urge for reduction in £30,000 earnings threshold for migrants, big boost to R\u0026ampD spending and a strategy for how Britain achieves net zero carbon emissionsClick to followThe IndependentBusinesses have called on the incoming prime minister to get Britain’s economy back on track, making it not only more prosperous but fairer and more inclusive, after three years of stalled progress.The Confederation of British Industry published a “Business Manifesto” on Monday in which it urges either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to secure a Brexit deal and implement a broader long-term vision for the economy that drives investment.Companies have held off investing in new plants, research and equipment in recent months as uncertainty about the UK’s future has grown.Mr Johnson, the favourite\u0026nbspin the race to become Britain\u0027s new prime minister, has proposed cutting income tax for the wealthiest Britons and handing a stamp duty reduction for homeowners whose properties are worth more than half a million pounds.Mr Hunt has pledged to cut corporation tax and boost defence spending as part of plans expected to cost up to £65bn.

Asda announced earlier this month that the service would be rolled out to 50 stores by the end of this year.Amazon takes on Uber with investment in food delivery firm DeliverooSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe failed to seal a £12bn mega-merger with Asda that he hoped would give the two supermarket chains the scale to confront challenges they face from all sides.The company\u0027s sales have been falling amid fierce competition from delivery apps and discount stores while further trouble could be ahead with online giants like Amazon making steps into the groceries market.Sainsbury’s sales dropped 1.2 per cent in its latest quarter despite large price discounts across a range of products.Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s chief digital officer said he\u0026nbsprecognised shoppers’ growing desire for convenience.\u0026nbsp“We’re excited to see what our customers think before deciding if, how and where we go next with the offer,” Ms Moriarty\u0026nbspsaid.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This forecast was based on a type of a no-deal Brexit, outlined by the IMF, that assumes no border disruptions. The fund’s more severe scenario incorporates significant border disruptions that increase Britain’s import costs.On another point, NIESR appears to be in greater agreement with the OBR: the think tank said there is a 25 per cent chance that the economy is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The OBR also said last week that the UK may be slipping into “a full-blown recession”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aside from Glastonbury, few other events spark so much excitement around the unveiling of their lineup. And while there are fewer “rock and roll” names on the billing this year, Primavera is leading the charge when it comes to proper representation of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders – without sacrificing anything in terms of quality. More than 50 per cent of the lineup is comprised of female-fronted acts, including Cardi B, FKA twigs, Christine and the Queens, Charli XCX, Robyn, Janelle Monae, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kate Tempest, Sigrid, Courtney Barnett, Yaeji, Peggy Gou and Helena Hauff. You’ve also got Interpol, Future, Nas, Mura Masa, Suede, Tame Impala, Kurt Vile and Mac deMarco. So it’s not as though guests will be short on options.Belgium’s biggest music festival often scores the most impressive lineup of any in Europe, and this year is no different. But don’t let the name mislead you: Rock Werchter’s lineup is always eclectic, and this year’s will include headline performances from Florence + the Machine, Muse and The Cure, plus Mumford and Sons, The 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, Kylie Minogue, Weezer, Brockhampton, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mac DeMarco. The festival site is situated on a farm near the town of Leuven, which is just a half-hour train from Brussels so festival-goers can choose to stay in the city if they don’t feel like camping. Organisers take special care to ensure good accessibility for all, so there is a separate entrance for less physically abled guests, and plastic surfacing over the grounds for easier wheelchair use.Roskilde is the biggest festival in northern Europe, so you expect big names – and each year organisers deliver. This year it’s going big on “the power of pop” and its ability to bring people together, so you have avant-garde artists like Christine and the Queens plus goth-rock legends The Cure. Also on the billing are Jungle, Tears for Fears, Alma, Julia Holter, Parquet Courts, Travis Scott, Brockhampton and Flohio. You’ll be joined by more than 130,000 fellow music lovers, and situated right next to the Danish capital of Copenhagen with easy connections by train, bus and air.This has to be the best lineup of any festival this summer, plus it’s cheaper than Glastonbury and the weather will surely be better too. Artists performing include The Cure, Lauryn Hill, Vampire Weekend, The 1975, The National, Bon Iver, Robyn, Years \u0026amp Years, Mogwai, Sharon Van Etten, Iggy Pop, Gossip, Iggy Pop, Bonobo and Jorja Smith. The festival’s ferris wheel is the stuff of legend, providing guests with beautiful views of the festival site and beyond. Things don’t really kick off until around 6pm either, so there’s plenty of time to take in the surrounding art galleries, flea markets, parks and more fantastic restaurants, bars and shops than you could ever hope to visit in the space of one trip. Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.Primavera is one of the biggest and most anticipated festivals around.

Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason. Rock en Seine takes place at the historical site of Domaine National de Saint-Cloud, which is regarded as one of the most beautiful gardens in Europe. The lineup is comprised of a mix of global stars and some of the most exciting international up and comers, from Foals and Aphex Twin to Agar Agar, Sharon Van Etten, Bring Me the Horizon and Polo \u0026amp Pan.“I understood as far as it was a comedy sketch, people were getting into it, it was cool… said David.After The Times\u0026nbspinterviewer protested that the sketch show wasn’t “cool”, it was “cruel”, David reasoned: “It’s not different to\u0026nbspSpitting Image, which serves its purpose.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Asda announced earlier this month that the service would be rolled out to 50 stores by the end of this year.Amazon takes on Uber with investment in food delivery firm DeliverooSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe failed to seal a £12bn mega-merger with Asda that he hoped would give the two supermarket chains the scale to confront challenges they face from all sides.The company\u0027s sales have been falling amid fierce competition from delivery apps and discount stores while further trouble could be ahead with online giants like Amazon making steps into the groceries market.Sainsbury’s sales dropped 1.2 per cent in its latest quarter despite large price discounts across a range of products.Clodagh Moriarty, Sainsbury’s chief digital officer said he\u0026nbsprecognised shoppers’ growing desire for convenience.\u0026nbsp“We’re excited to see what our customers think before deciding if, how and where we go next with the offer,” Ms Moriarty\u0026nbspsaid.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If you do not reply, the parent will call the head\u0026nbspfirst thing in the morning, they said.‘Aggressive’ parents demand teachers email and message them 247Going straight to the head when a complaint is not immediately answered is part of a rising culture in society of “wanting to complain at the highest level”, the report says. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe findings\u0026nbspcome after\u0026nbspa survey from the\u0026nbspNASUWT\u0026nbspteaching union in April revealed that\u0026nbsp“unbearable” communication from parents\u0026nbsphad led to\u0026nbspstaff considering quitting.The growing use of apps by schools is making it easier for parents to contact teachers directly 247, adding to their\u0026nbspworkload\u0026nbspand affecting their health, the union said.\u0026nbspSome teachers also have “unrealistic” expectations placed on them by parents who want “the highest grades for their children despite their lack of effort”, the Ofsted report says.Ms Spielman said: “Schools have to play their part to improve their staff’s wellbeing and manage the expectation of parents.“It’s high time leaders took steps to end this ‘instant response culture’, that is putting huge pressure on teachers, and allow them to focus on the important work of teaching.”‘Bullying’ Ofsted ‘too test-obsessed to understand Steiner schools’Ofsted: Intimidation of teachers over LGBT+ lessons is ‘unacceptable’Parents must be responsible for protecting children from knife crimeMore than two in three (68 per cent) of teachers feel their profession is undervalued in society – and many blame a lack of funding.Staff say a lack of resources, such as computers and library materials, stops them from doing their job as well as they can.Some teachers describe the facilities as “laughably poor” and they say classrooms are so small or badly equipped that they cannot provide a “good service to students”.Nearly half (46 per cent) of school staff reported low and medium levels of satisfaction with life, compared to just 18 per cent of the general population in EnglandMs Spielman added: “Teaching is one of the most important jobs there is, so we need to make sure it is highly valued by society and a rewarding career to choose.“As the school year comes to a close, I hope parents really appreciate all the long hours and hard work that teachers have put in for their child.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We know that poor behaviour damages teachers’ morale and increases workload and stress, which is why we want schools to instil cultures of good behaviour from top to bottom.“Where staff are struggling, we trust headteachers to take action to address the causes and ensure teachers have the support they need.“We are also tackling excessive data burdens in schools simplifying the accountability system to target the associated burdens and working with Ofsted to ensure staff workload is considered as part of a school’s inspection judgement.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018When Mr Musk first envisioned the Hyperloop system in a white paper in 2013, he suggested that vacuum tubes could allow transportation pods to\u0026nbsphit\u0026nbspspeeds of up to 1,000kph.The latest speed record is not only a long way off this prediction, it is also not on the same level as the fastest high-speed trains currently in use in China and elsewhere around the world.Yet the continued interest in the technology – not least among much larger operations in the form of Virgin Hyperloop One and HyperloopTT – means a faster and more commercially viable form of the Hyperloop may not be a long way off.SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition broke new records – and new pods (SpaceX Hyperloop)After announcing the new speed record on Twitter, Mr Musk revealed that the 2020 edition of the Hyperloop competition will take place in a 10km vacuum tunnel with a curve.A longer test track should presumably lead to much faster speeds, while the curve will mean teams will have to prepare a pod that can cope with real-world routes.No further details were given about the new test track, though HyperloopTT has previously promised to build a 10km track along a stretch of desert separating Aby Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.The developers of the track hope for it to be in place in time for the Expo 2020 event due to take place next year.This track is important for the future of the Hyperloop, Dirk\u0026nbspAhlborn, CEO of\u0026nbspHyperloopTT, previously told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Once the\u0026nbspUAE\u0026nbsprout is completed, other Hyperloop networks around the world will be quick to follow, as the technology will already be there.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even recent Pixel phones have only notches at the top.But the new rumours show that the Google Pixel 4 could have a huge bezel at the top of its display. And it could be hiding something more than the usual selfie camera.It also includes a large oval opening at the top, which does not seem to be the right shape for a normal photo camera or for any of the other sensors usually held at the top of the display.Instead, rumours suggest that it could hold a motion-sensing system that will be able to precisely track where its owner is and what they are doing. That would presumably use technology developed as part of Google\u0027s Project Soli, which looks to build small radar sensors that can be put into devices the size of phones or even smartwatches.Google to fix Chrome bug that gives you away when browsing incognitoSuch a technology could be used to allow people to wave their hands in front of their phone to control it, for instance.

But Whitehall sources said today that the plan will not go ahead.Sources close to the chancellor - who will quit on Wednesday as Ms May stands down - said he did not oppose increases to education spending in principle but believed it was absolutely right that the new PM and chancellor should be able to consider long-term funding decisions in the round as part of the upcoming cross-government spending review.Among other public sector workers receiving pay rises for 201920 above the 2 per cent rate of inflation were:- The armed forces, where a 2.9 per cent increase will be focused on improving the pay of the most junior personnel, bringing the basic pay of other ranks after completion of initial training up by more than 6 per cent to £20,000. A corporal in the Army will see annual pay rise by £995, compared to £768 for the starting salary of an officer- Senior hospital doctors and NHS dentists, who will receive 2.5 per cent rises, worth between £1,940 and £2,630 for consultants and between\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp£970 and £1,820 for specialty\u0026nbspdoctors- Police, who enjoy a\u0026nbsp2.5 per cent boost, providing a police constable with up to £978 more\u0026nbspthis year.Pay rises for senior civil servants and military top brass will be limited to\u0026nbsp2 per cent, after ministers rejected recommendations for a 2.2 per cent increase from an independent pay review.The rises represent the second annual\u0026nbspabove-inflation increase for public sector workers since the lifting of a 1 per cent cap which had been in place since 2013 and followed\u0026nbspa two-year freeze for most staff.iStockphoto)But the British Medical Association said the rises failed to offset the impact of 11 years of little or no pay increases for England\u0027s most experienced doctors, amounting to a real-terms pay cut of as much as 30 per cent for consultants. To receive their full recommended risse of 3.5 per cent, speciality doctors will have to sign up to a new contract deal, said the BMA.The chair of the BMA\u0026nbspconsultants committee, Dr Rob Harwood, said: “It’s clear from today’s announcement that the Government has not recognised nor rewarded the work and commitment of some of our most experienced and senior doctors and the pay uplift does not provide any mechanism to address historic underpayments to doctors.Ms May, said: “Whether it’s keeping us safe, saving lives or educating the next generation, our public sector workers deserve this pay rise in recognition of the brilliant job they do on a daily basis.“In 2017 we ended the public sector pay cap and I’m pleased that we can build on this today by giving almost a million of our dedicated public servants an above inflation salary increase.”Mr Hammond added: “Public sector workers deliver Britain’s world class public services and should be properly rewarded which is why I’m confirming a second year of above-inflation pay rises today.“This is in recognition of the hard work of millions of people, including soldiers, teachers and doctors, and will help us recruit and retain the best staff.“We are able to afford these pay rises because our balanced approach means we have reduced our debt while investing in public services, including pay.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This forecast was based on a type of a no-deal Brexit, outlined by the IMF, that assumes no border disruptions. The fund’s more severe scenario incorporates significant border disruptions that increase Britain’s import costs.On another point, NIESR appears to be in greater agreement with the OBR: the think tank said there is a 25 per cent chance that the economy is already in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The OBR also said last week that the UK may be slipping into “a full-blown recession”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ebola has been in Beni for almost a year now.\u0026nbsp“Blood started coming out of his body,” she told The Independent. “They brought him to the hospital but there was no cure. I caught the illness because I was looking after him. I started vomiting and had a headache and flu. I felt so sorry for myself. But I went to the hospital in time to be cured.”“I was really sad because he was the only son I had. Sometimes when I remember everything that has happened, I start burning. Ebola attacks more women than men because women are more compassionate. Most of the time, if a baby gets sick, it is the woman who brings her to the hospital. Women spend time with children here.”Created with Sketch.Life after Ebola: a community rebuilds in Sierra Leone Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘During Ebola, they quarantined areas.

The children are at assembly with no uniforms. I am the teacher at the school so I took this photo to show how we have been working hard for our children to be educated’‘Here is my son, Sessay (left), with his friends. I was happy to snap them. I have given birth to six children, but only three are still alive. The first one I lost was three years ago, and the second was two years ago. Four months ago I lost Senior Lahai. He was six months old and was affected by a runny stomach and a rising body temperature’‘Four months ago I lost Senior Lahai. He was six months old and was affected by a runny stomach and a rising body temperature. He was really, really sick, he wasn\u0027t even taking breast milk, and he died. My heart was broken. My baby used to be strong. He was able to sit by himself and was just starting to practise to crawl and reach for things. He laughed a lot when I played with him, I’d clap and dance. I have a happy moment when he started sitting by himself and learning to crawl. Those are the happy moments that makes a mother most happy. The moment I remember most about Lahai was when he was breastfeeding and was playing with my neck and chin with his hand. I look to the future and hope that such things won\u0027t happen again, and that God will give me children that stay with me’‘My step brother Ibrahim is building our toilet with loamy soil because we don’t have cement. WaterAid taught us about good sanitation and I want to show that we are now building our own toilets so that we will not go to the bush or use the stream as a toilet that is why I took this photo’Washing in the stream: ‘When we came here the water system was very bad. I know that when I drink dirty water I get sick. We are getting diarrhoea because we are drinking that type of water. If I am sick I am not able to earn money because I am not able to go to work, and I have to stay at home, which is very difficult for me’‘These are the contractors that came to build the water well, and they are mixing the stones and the cement to build the cover of the well’‘I started tree climbing when I was living with my grandmother and she was trying to get some palm kernels and process them to make the oil that we use. I didn’t like doing the processing part so I decided to climb the trees to do the harvest instead. Tree climbing is very difficult. At times you can be confronted by a snake, as you are going up you just see one and it will hiss at you. If you are not strong you are going to fall out of the tree, and could die! I am just doing it for necessity sake. I don’t want to do this job really, but at the moment I have no other means of making money, so I have no choice but to do this to manage my family’‘They killed my uncle during the war. I was not in this village during the war I was in Guinea. Just after the war, my mother asked me to come back home. There were no houses when I returned it had all been destroyed’‘This is my son Bockarie. He reminds me of his mother, who is not presently here with me, and he resembles me. Recently my son was very sick and we had to take him to the clinic to get treatment. Even getting to the clinic costs money. I didn\u0027t have any money, so I had to borrow money from the community people so I could take him to the hospital. Having very good drinking water would ease the issues with having to take people to the hospital because of illness, and the problem of finding the money to manage that’‘Sidique is 21 years old, he is my daughter’s husband and is drinking from the stream we use to fetch water. Our forefathers created this village, and the water was good. They covered it with a concrete box to keep it safe, but all of that fell down during the war, and afterwards no one could repair it. The water is not good here now and I have worms as a result. It will be very good to have clean water it would give us a long life. If you have good drinking water, then your life is safe, but if you don’t then your life is not secure. Having good drinking water would ease the issues with having to take people to the hospital because of illness, and the problem of finding the money to manage that’‘We the women of this village are experiencing the problems with lack of water and we pray that things will change. The rain washes everything, including faeces into the water. The children get diarrhoea from the water.

She is a traditional birth attendant and plays an important role within the women’s society. Matu suffers from poor health she has stomach problems caused by the dirty water‘This is my father helping to dig the water well, so that we will have clean water to drink. I am happy because we are going to have a well in my village. I don’t think the water we currently collect from the muddy spring is good for drinking because it is exposed, and leaves and other things fall in it. I also get water down there with my mum, and sometimes I go with the other kids. Sometimes when I drink it, I have a stomach pain, and it also brings me headache. I have got sick from that, and I was taken to the health centre’‘This is my family – my mother, father and younger brother. When I’m not with them this picture will make me feel closer to them’‘Moserie Yajah was lying down in the grass, and asked me to get a shot of him. At the moment, every day people ask me to get a photo of them. I feel very happy when people ask for a picture. What I love most to get a shot of is people that are well dressed, sitting in a chair or in a very comfortable area that I can snap’‘We were going down to Matu’s place, and my friends and brother decided to cover themselves with that fishing net, and asked me to take a shot of them. The fishing net was taken from Ginnah’s mother (Massah) and I think the picture is really good. I like the photo mainly because they are standing close to the wash yard, where people go to heat their water and wash. I love it because they are all my brothers, and we look out for each other’‘I love this picture. I took this photo of Bockarie when he was drinking water. The water was collected from the muddy spring where everyone collects water. I don’t think it is good for drinking because it is exposed, and leaves and other things fall in it. I also get water down there with my mum, and sometimes I go with the other kids. Sometimes when I drink it, I have a stomach pain, and it also brings me headache. I have got sick from that, and I was taken to the health centre. If it rains, we harvest rainwater’‘This is my cousin Papay we are very close – he lives nearby and we spend lots of time together. In this picture he is messing around. On his head is what our fathers make to catch fish in small streams. We then eat some fish and they sell the rest. It is important for our survival’‘The community people helping to build the water well, I was glad about this, that is why I took this photo.’ Kempah is a youth leader and mechanic from Tombohuaun‘These children are our next of kin, my children and their friends. They are wonderful children’ ‘Here, my father, brothers and aunt are separating cocoa fruit from pods. By selling cocoa, my family earns enough to pay my school fees’ ‘We have now built a small school in our village. This is inside the class for my children’s first day in school. I took this picture to show them in the future so they will know that I want them to be educated and also free from diseases’‘This is my Aunt Mamie Ansumana. She is 40 and is a farmer. She loves going to the farm and likes to smile. She looked after me when my children died. The dirty water caused the death of two of my children I don’t want anything to happen to the others. She took me from the room where Senior Lahai died to her own room. I slept in her room for some time. I want to thank to her because she is still taking care of us’‘During Ebola, they quarantined areas. My husband was at Kailahun and couldn’t cross the boundary, so we were separated.

I don’t want to do this job really, but at the moment I have no other means of making money, so I have no choice but to do this to manage my family’‘They killed my uncle during the war. I was not in this village during the war I was in Guinea. Just after the war, my mother asked me to come back home. There were no houses when I returned it had all been destroyed’‘This is my son Bockarie. He reminds me of his mother, who is not presently here with me, and he resembles me. Recently my son was very sick and we had to take him to the clinic to get treatment. Even getting to the clinic costs money. I didn\u0027t have any money, so I had to borrow money from the community people so I could take him to the hospital. Having very good drinking water would ease the issues with having to take people to the hospital because of illness, and the problem of finding the money to manage that’‘Sidique is 21 years old, he is my daughter’s husband and is drinking from the stream we use to fetch water. Our forefathers created this village, and the water was good. They covered it with a concrete box to keep it safe, but all of that fell down during the war, and afterwards no one could repair it. The water is not good here now and I have worms as a result. It will be very good to have clean water it would give us a long life. If you have good drinking water, then your life is safe, but if you don’t then your life is not secure. Having good drinking water would ease the issues with having to take people to the hospital because of illness, and the problem of finding the money to manage that’‘We the women of this village are experiencing the problems with lack of water and we pray that things will change. The rain washes everything, including faeces into the water. The children get diarrhoea from the water. With clean water, I would be clean and would not suffer from sickness’‘This is my brother’s wife, she is holding both her daughter and my granddaughter’Matu is the life and soul of the village of Tombohuaun. She is a traditional birth attendant and plays an important role within the women’s society. Matu suffers from poor health she has stomach problems caused by the dirty water‘This is my father helping to dig the water well, so that we will have clean water to drink. I am happy because we are going to have a well in my village. I don’t think the water we currently collect from the muddy spring is good for drinking because it is exposed, and leaves and other things fall in it. I also get water down there with my mum, and sometimes I go with the other kids. Sometimes when I drink it, I have a stomach pain, and it also brings me headache. I have got sick from that, and I was taken to the health centre’‘This is my family – my mother, father and younger brother. When I’m not with them this picture will make me feel closer to them’‘Moserie Yajah was lying down in the grass, and asked me to get a shot of him. At the moment, every day people ask me to get a photo of them. I feel very happy when people ask for a picture. What I love most to get a shot of is people that are well dressed, sitting in a chair or in a very comfortable area that I can snap’‘We were going down to Matu’s place, and my friends and brother decided to cover themselves with that fishing net, and asked me to take a shot of them. The fishing net was taken from Ginnah’s mother (Massah) and I think the picture is really good. I like the photo mainly because they are standing close to the wash yard, where people go to heat their water and wash. I love it because they are all my brothers, and we look out for each other’‘I love this picture. I took this photo of Bockarie when he was drinking water. The water was collected from the muddy spring where everyone collects water. I don’t think it is good for drinking because it is exposed, and leaves and other things fall in it. I also get water down there with my mum, and sometimes I go with the other kids. Sometimes when I drink it, I have a stomach pain, and it also brings me headache. I have got sick from that, and I was taken to the health centre. If it rains, we harvest rainwater’‘This is my cousin Papay we are very close – he lives nearby and we spend lots of time together. In this picture he is messing around. On his head is what our fathers make to catch fish in small streams. We then eat some fish and they sell the rest. It is important for our survival’‘The community people helping to build the water well, I was glad about this, that is why I took this photo.’ Kempah is a youth leader and mechanic from Tombohuaun‘These children are our next of kin, my children and their friends. They are wonderful children’ ‘Here, my father, brothers and aunt are separating cocoa fruit from pods. By selling cocoa, my family earns enough to pay my school fees’ ‘We have now built a small school in our village. This is inside the class for my children’s first day in school. I took this picture to show them in the future so they will know that I want them to be educated and also free from diseases’‘This is my Aunt Mamie Ansumana. She is 40 and is a farmer. She loves going to the farm and likes to smile. She looked after me when my children died. The dirty water caused the death of two of my children I don’t want anything to happen to the others. She took me from the room where Senior Lahai died to her own room. I slept in her room for some time. I want to thank to her because she is still taking care of us’Ms Kahindo said Ebola has\u0026nbspdamaged trading and profits in the region – explaining people are not buying as much due to the disease. She also explained Ebola survivors, such as herself, face a great deal of stigma within the community.\u0026nbsp“People are somehow afraid when they look at Ebola victims even though they are survivors,” she added.\u0026nbsp”They believe I can contaminate other people but I can’t. People talk a lot. It is a close-knit community. Especially when they take someone from their home to be an Ebola Treatment Centre for three\u0026nbspweeks. People know where you have gone.”The World Health Organisation declared the Ebola epidemic a public health emergency last\u0026nbspWednesday – with the director general appealing for the international community to help with funds.\u0026nbspDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the World Health Organisation was working on a new plan to control the epidemic which would cost “hundred of millions” of dollars. On Monday, the DRC’s health minister Oly Ilugna\u0026nbspresigned in protest at an announcement from the presidency that it would take control of the Ebola outbreak\u0026nbspresponse.Global emergency declared over Ebola after deadly outbreak in centralKellie Ryan, a spokesperson for the International Rescue Committee’s Ebola Response, estimated the latest death toll for Ebola in the DRC\u0026nbspto be 1,698. She said around 12 new cases are reported every day and there have been 2,522 confirmed and probable cases.She argued women in the country were bearing the brunt of the crisis – with women more likely to get the illness than men due to women being the “primary caretakers” of children, the sick and the elderly, which exposes them more to the virus.\u0026nbspMs Ryan added: “Gender inequality does have something to do with this. More than 60 per cent of confirmed and probable cases are women. Additionally, because women take care of the home, they have to go out to fetch water more often to keep up with more frequent hand washing practices and rigorous cleaning. This makes them vulnerable to gender-based violence as they travelling by themselves more frequently.“Survivors of Ebola face stigmatization by members of their community and sometimes even their families. Neighbours might think they are still contagious and will not want to engage with them or let their children play with their children. A woman’s husband might think she can still pass on the disease. The IRC provides survivors with psychosocial support to help them handle these feelings of isolation.”She said the fragile security situation makes it harder for herself, her colleagues and others responding to Ebola to do their jobs.\u0026nbspWhat is Ebola and what is the risk to travellers?“Due to attacks by armed groups, we are sometimes forced to suspend programming to ensure the safety and security of our staff,” she added. “Ebola is a very complicated disease, and the outbreak is happening in an area and to communities that have faced decades of violence by armed groups. It is easy to understand why the local community distrusts the response. Ebola is a new disease to them, and they can’t understand why a year on, cases continue to rise. There are rumours that health workers are profiting off the outbreak or even brought Ebola to the area themselves.”Since January, there have been 198 attacks against the health response that have led to seven deaths and left 58 healthcare workers and patients injured. Clinics and treatment centres have been torched.The current outbreak in the eastern part of the DRC started back in 2018 and is the tenth to hit the country since 1976 when the virus was first discovered. It is the second biggest Ebola outbreak, after the west Africa epidemic which saw 28,616 cases of disease and 11,310 deaths reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016.The crisis has come to a critical point since the first case of Ebola in the eastern city of Goma was confirmed earlier in the week. The city of two million people is a major transport hub on the border with Rwanda – with transport links to the broader region.Health officials confirm first Ebola case in DRC city of GomaKaswera Flourine, a 45-year-old, had six children but two died. While one died from malaria, another died from Ebola. Ms Flourine was among one of the first people to get Ebola from Mangina – a city in North Kivu province. \u0026nbsp“I went to hospital because I had malaria but then the nurses contaminated me with Ebola while looking after me,” she said.\u0026nbsp”I was afraid because I noticed lots of people were dying from Ebola. I knew it was rare to recover. I was in a coma for three weeks. When I woke up from the coma, I was still sick. Other people thought I had died, I had come out to talk to people to show I was alive.”Kavira Desange, who is 57, had eight children but now has just six due to one dying of poison at the age of seven and the other dying of a stomach ache and different diseases.Ms Desange contracted Ebola while looking after her daughter-in-law who died after getting Ebola.\u0026nbsp“After three days, she passed away,” she said. “My daughter-in-law had a baby but she was not contaminated because she refused to take care of the baby. After finishing the burial ceremony, I returned to Beni to go home but the symptoms started. I began to have a cold, a cough, and get influenza. After some days I\u0026nbspstarted having diarrhoea.”She went to the hospital where they tried to place her in an Ebola Treatment Centre but she ended up going home because she was scared. However, once home, her symptoms got worse. The hospital staff came to get her to take her to the centre where they gave her medicine.\u0026nbsp“I was a farmer before getting sick but now I care for people who have Ebola because I am immune to the disease,” she added.Democratic Republic of Congo\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue - Sean GallupOn the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills.

Critics argue the demolitions are part of a broader policy of forced displacement aimed at cementing Israel’s control of east Jerusalem.\u0026nbspIsrael took control of the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and Israel\u0026nbspclaims east Jerusalem is an inisible part of its capital. The international community considers both areas to be occupied territory, and the Palestinians seek them as parts of a future independent state.\u0026nbspThe location of Sur Baher places it in the centre of these disputes. Parts of the village lie inside the municipal boundary of Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem and parts outside the barrier, in the West Bank. But some lie\u0026nbspin between: just outside the Jerusalem line but still on the Israeli side of the barrier.Palestinian owners say their buildings are\u0026nbspwithin areas run by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But Israel’s Supreme Court rejected a final appeal from residents of Sur Baher this month, clearing the way for the demolitions. \u0026nbspGilad Erdan, Israel’s minister of public security, said the Supreme Court ruled the illegal construction “constitutes a severe security threat and can provide cover to suicide bombers and other terrorists hiding among civilian population”.\u0026nbspPalestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh described the demolitions as a “grave aggression.”Sur Baher (EPA)“This is a continuation of the forced displacement of the people of Jerusalem from their homes and lands –\u0026nbspa war crime and a crime against humanity,” he said.The European Union criticised the demolitions, saying in a statement that “the continuation of this policy undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect for a lasting peace”.Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator, and other UN officials called on the Israeli authorities last week to halt the demolitions. They said 17 Palestinians faced displacement from the plans to level 10 buildings, including dozens of apartments.With additional reporting by agencies\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

secretions are thought to stave off signs of ageing as well as giving skin a “glowing” quality.As a result a raft of new snail farms have sprung up in the Far Eastern country as demand for the slippery shell-dwellers “mucin” rises.Over the last three years, farmers and entrepreneurial locals have begun keeping the snails that were once regarded as a plague on the crops.Snail slime has become worth more than gold with a snail mucin face mask costing upwards of £.Altogether the global slime industry is worth an estimated £ million.There are now more than  snail farms in the Thai province of Nakhon Nayok, two hours east of Bangkok.Phatinisiri Thangkeaw, a teacher, said she had begun her business by buying snails from nearby rice farmers, who were glad to be rid of them because they wreak havoc on newly planted crops.She pays local farmers around  for a kilogram of snails and now has more than , snails that she milks for their mucin and then sells.She told the : “Farmers used to throw them on the road or in the rivers but now they sell them to me to earn extra money.”The process of harvesting the slime is seen as humane, involving dripping water over the snails to encourage them to secrete the mucin, which does not kill or harm them.To keep the quality high, in Thailand the snails are fed vegetables and grains and are only milked once every three weeks.In Thailand, the raw mucin is all flogged to one cosmetics company, Aden International, which was established after Kitpong Puttarathuvanun saw a gap in the market.The businessman sells the slime both as an expensive serum and a dried powder.It was in the s that the potential of snail secretions were noticed by breeders in Chile, who marvelled at how soft their hands became after handling the slimy critters.The first cream containing snail mucin was produced in Chile, but more recently it has boomed in the Korean and American beauty market.The mucin contains ingredients like glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, and glycolic acid.These chemicals are said to stimulate collagen, slowing the onset of wrinkles and healing acne and reducing scar tissue, though dermatologists are ided on the benefits.Other bizarre beauty treatments to hit the headlines recently include creams made from circumcised foreskins and “vampire facials” which involve rubbing your own blood on your

surrounded by makesht bedding.A pile of shoes can also be seen in the foreground.The picture was taken yesterday and released by Fars News Agency, a news agency with close ties to the Iranian regime.Other images show an Iranian soldier patrolling one of the ships walkways, and the ship seen from a distance down the barrel of a rle.Footage from Iranian state media showed the crew inside the ship, sat round a table talking and seemingly comfortable.Members can also be seen working in the ships kitchen and standing on what looks to be its bridge.Iran launched a gunboat and helicopter raid on the UK-registered ship last week, claiming the vessel had turned off its tracker and ignored warnings after hitting a fishing boat.Irans Revolutionary Guard later said on the countrys state television that the ship had been boarded for violating international maritime rules.But Stena Bulk, which owns the ship, said it was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”.The move is widely assumed to have been a retaliation to the British seizure of an Iranian vessel off Gibraltar last week.The Iranian vessel was suspected of breaching an embargo on oil shipments to Syria, but Iran said at the time it would not leave such evil deeds unanswered.In a letter to the UN Security Council, the UKs deputy permanent representative Jonathan Allen wrote that the British vessel had been in Omani waters with its transponder switched on when it was approached.Stena Bulk said Iranian authorities had told them the ships crew were in “good health” and being held at Iranian port Bandar Abbas.But in a further taunt to the Royal Navy, Iran last night hoisted an Iranian flag over the vessel.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called the seizure illegal and said that British shipping “must and will be protected”.Dramatic footage released on Saturday showed the moment Tehran troops abseiled onto the ship the night before.The clip is thought to have been filmed in the southern port of Bandar Abbas, where jet boats have been sailing around the British ship.It has also emerged Tehran wants to impose a toll on all ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, saying it would be used to protect the safety of the vessels.Any move to create a toll is likely to be met with hostility as a fth of the worlds oil passes through the strait.On Saturday, state-funded Press TV published an article, entitled From Piracy to Impotence, criticising British activity in the Gulf.Diplomatic spats aside, any objective review of the facts will not fail to recognise that in recent events in the Persian Gulf and the Gibraltar Strait, the UK has engaged in illegal, and destabilising, activities on at least three occasions, it said.Audio has also emerged of radio exchanges before the seizure between Iranian armed forces and a nearby British warship, HMS Montrose.In the recording, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard can be heard telling the Impero: If you obey, you will be safe. Alter course to  degrees immediately, over.After that, HMS Montrose can be heard telling the ships crew: This is British warship F.I reiterate, that as you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered.The frigate then asks the Iranian vessel to confirm it is not intending to violate international law by attempting to board the tanker, in the recording obtained by security firm Dryad Global.Moments later, Iranian special forces stormed the ship by abseiling down from a helicopter.Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said that HMS Montrose had been an hour away from the Impero, too far to physically stop the seizure.Montrose is the only warship Britain has in the Gulf to cover the -mile strait.However, the government has not arranged fixed times at which civilian vessels from the UK could sail through the Strait under the protection of the frigate, as it has done previously to guard against Somali pirates.It can also be revealed that in April Britain withdrew two Royal Navy Wildcat helicopters, which were based close by in Oman and provided surveillance of the Strait for hostile Iranian activity.It said at the time they were “no longer needed”.A nuclear-powered submarine and Royal Marine Commandos could now be sent to bolster Navy defences in the Gulf.The moves were discussed at emergency meetings of the Government’s Cobra security committee after Friday’s hijacks.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Iran it was choosing a “dangerous path” with its “totally unacceptable” actions in the Gulf.He said he had spoken to Iran’s foreign minister to voice his “extreme disappointment”.Last night Mr Hunt announced he had raised the maritime threat level to “level three” — or “critical.”The Tory leadership candidate is expected to use a Commons statement today to announce a package of diplomatic and economic measures.The UK could also push for EU and UN sanctions to be reimposed on the regime after they were lted in  as part of a deal on Irans nuclear programme.The UK and the EU have so far shown a willingness to help Iran ease the impact of sanctions reimposed by the US last year after President Trumps decision to withdraw from the deal.Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood today warned the Royal Navy is too small to protect British ships from Iran.He also threatened to freeze the countrys assetsit doesnt release the UK tanker.Askedthe drastic move was being considered, Mr Ellwood said: Cobra was taking place yesterday, so were looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options."},{"url":null,"title":"hay fever alert african plume pollen surge asthma","story":"Britain is set to sizzle this week as an African plume sweeps in bringing temperatures as high as C in parts of the country.The rising mercury will come with sweltering humidity, prompting Public Health Englandto issue a health warning.PHE issued a level- alert and readiness warning -

and it affects around  per cent of people with asthma.Grass pollen is the most common allergy and affects  per cent of people with hay fever, according to Allergy UK.However, there are some things contact lens wearers can try to help reduce the irritation.Use drops or ditch the contact lensesContact lens-friendly eye drops can help to calm down any itchiness and wearing prescription glassescan prevent pollen from getting into your eyes.Those suffering with hay fever could also try daily disposable lenses during the summer months.Stay insideDr Best also recommends: While it’s not always possible, staying inside when pollen count is high will help to avoid irritation or showering and changing your clothes when you get home will also help to remove pollen from skin and hair.Use VaselineBut, it is not just eyes which are affected, hay fever can also cause your ears to become itchy or inflamed.Specsavers’ chief audiologist Gordon Harrison says: Allergic reactions can cause the outer ear to itch or swell.The middle ear contains the Eustachian tube, which acts as a drainage tube, but when mucus clogs the middle ear it affects that drainage.This leads to a build-up in pressure, which can cause discomfort, popping in the ears or earache.To avoid irritation, try putting Vaseline around the nose to trap pollen, vacuum and dust regularly or you can try over the counter pain relief.Shower and change clothes often Showering and changing after being outside will help remove pollen and antihistamines decongestants can help relieve symptoms.The season runs from mid-May until July, with two peaks -

Luke Whatley was on his £, four-star Tui holiday with his girlfriend when he claims the horror unfolded.He says he couldn’t believe his eyes when he allegedly spotted the lively larva aposdoing the wormapos inside the chicken burger served at DIT Evrika Beach Club hotel in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria. Call centre worker Luke, , and girlfriend Hannah Coughlin, immediately lost their appetites when they reportedly made the grim discovery at the hotel’s buffet restaurant one lunchtime. Despite paying for an all-inclusive stay, the pair couldn’t bear the thought of eating another morsel there and claim to have instead forked out £ on food during their two-week stay. In a bid to cut costs, Luke and law student Hannah, , skipped meals and even resorted to nibbling on crisps and biscuits bought from a nearby shop. The couple also claim they were repeatedly served ‘undercooked’ chicken, coffee-making facilities in their room were not working and they even failed to get the sea view they paid extra for. TUI UK has since apologised to Luke and reassured their customers that they regularly conduct aposhealth and safety audits including hygieneapos at the hotels they feature. Luke, from Newbridge, South Wales, said: “I took one bite of the burger, looked and it and the maggot was crawling inside.It was wriggling - literally doing the worm. I was disgusted, it completely put me off. “There was just the one but one is all you need to lose your appetite. “I spat out what was in my mouth and Hannah stopped eating as well. She had ordered pizza but obviously when she saw that she couldn’t eat hers either. “We left the restaurant and went out for food. I was too fuming to see the rep at that point, I didnapost want to say anything I would regret. “A day or two later we went to the TUI rep and I emailed her a picture of the burger. She said she would contact the hygiene manager of the hotel and register a complaint for me.” He added: “We went to lunch and had Chinese food just down from the hotel. After what happened with the burger I was examining everything on my plate. “It put a dampener on the day generally. I was fuming about that and I’d already made my mind up that I wasnapost going to eat there again. “We basically lived off English breakfasts, burgers and Chinese food during our stay and ended up spending £ on food and drink."},{"url":null,"title":"dad sacked calling sick after","story":"NewsDad sacked for calling in sick after spending night caring for his sick tripletsFormer HGV tipper driver Ross Mclean felt he wouldnt be safe to work after staying up all night to care for three-year-old triplets Charlotte, Leah and Sophie who have weakened immune systems after being born prematurelyShareCommentsByHannah Graham:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsFormer HGV tipper driver Ross Mclean felt it wouldnt be safe for him to work after staying up all night to look after triplets, Charlotte, Leah and Sophie \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father says he was apossacked on the spotapos after he took a day off to care for his poorly triplet daughters.

His benefits were cut in half by DWP bosses when he was moved to Universal Credit from Employment Support Allowance, and his bid for Personal Independent Paymentwas rejected. Mr Nicholson, of Newcastle, told ChronicleLive he was stunned when the NHS sent a £ penalty charge notice accusing him of wrongly claiming free prescriptions. He had been receiving free prescriptions for the past five years.     Mr Nicholson said: I was shocked as I wasnapost aware this was going on.How can they justy serving penalty notices on already impoverished vulnerable benefit claimants struggling to feed themselves, let alone pay NHS fines. He said doctors have told him his condition could kill him within two years.    Mr Nicholson has blamed a lack of communication between the NHS and DWP. He said: If a claimant has issued a aposfit noteapos at the beginning of a Universal Credit claim, surely theyaposd have access to free prescriptions  The penalty charge notice has will also have to be paid by some people who already have the advance repayments and tax credit repayments to make. The situation beggars belief, he added.  Recent figures revealed .million people were fined for wrongly trying to claim free NHS prescriptions, but almost a quarter of them - , - were wrongly accused of prescription fraud.

The little royal is celebrating his sixth birthday today, and the third in line to the throne is sure to have a lovely day. But how exactly do the youngest royals spend their special days  The royal family normally release a new photo of them to mark the occasion, but like any other kids they also have an exciting celebration away from the public eye. Weaposve taken a look back at how Prince George and Princess Charlotte have celebrated their birthdays so far.  Prince George First birthday Kate and Wills threw a aposlow-keyapos tea party for their first born to mark his birthday at Kensington Palace. Guests began to arrive from pm, with Kate’s parents Carole and Michael pulling up first, followed by Kate and William’s former Principal Private Secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is one of George’s seven godparents, carrying a brightly wrapped present. Kate’s brother James and sister Pippa, William’s cousin Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall also attended. But great-granny the Queen was the guest of honour, arriving an hour after the party started in a green Bentley. As you do. Prince Philip was unable to attend, but Kate and Wills took little George to Buckingham Palace in the morning so he could see his great-granddad on his special day.  Wills and Kate issued a statement on the eve of their son’s birthday to thank everyone for their good wishes for George. They said: We would like to take this opportunity on George’s first birthday to thank everyone over the last year, wherever we have met them, both at home and overseas, for their warm and generous good wishes to George and our family. They also shared adorable new photos of him, taken at the Natural History Museum just before his big day. Second birthday Another year, another very royal party! By this point, Kate and Wills have moved to Anmer Hall in Norfolk, so held the celebrations there. They invited about a dozen youngsters to the party, as well as their close family. Many of the royals had to miss the event as they were on official duties, but William was given time off to celebrate. Prince Philip also managed to make a surprise visit having missed the previous yearaposs celebrations. The party lasted for about an hour and a half. And of course, another gorgeous photo. This time the family picked a picture of William holding George, who is leaning towards the camera with a huge cheeky grin on his face. Third birthday Kate and Wills released a series of new photos of the growing prince to mark the big number three. The royal family released four lovely pictures of George with the caption: Canapost believe itaposs been three years already! In one of the photos, George is feeding the Cambridgesapos dog Lupo an ice cream.  Fourth birthday The prince spent the run-up to his big day on an official tour of Poland and Germany with his parents. During the trip the little royal was spotted beaming from ear to ear as he sat in the cockpit of a helicopter. Kate and William shared a photo of Prince George with a huge smile on his face to mark the birthday. Kensington Palace said in a statement: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to share a new official portrait of Prince George to mark His Royal Highnessaposs fourth birthday tomorrow.    The photograph was taken at Kensington Palace at the end of June by Chris Jackson, Getty Images Royal Photographer. The Duke and Duchess are very pleased to share this lovely picture as they celebrate Prince Georgeaposs fourth birthday, and would like to thank everyone for all of the kind messages they have received. Fth birthday Prince George celebrated his fth birthday on holiday in the Caribbean - lucky kid! It was believed to be the familyaposs first holiday as a five, after the birth of Prince Louis in April, and weaposre sure they had a lovely time. They reportedly went to Mustique, an island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Sixth birthday George is celebrating turning six with his family at their country estate Anmer Hall in Norfolk and weaposre sure Kate and Wills have got some lovely things planned. There have also been reports that he will be having a small party with some of his school friends when he gets back to London.  The family also released three new photos of the little prince to mark the occasion, including two of him wearing his England football shirt. Princess Charlotte First birthday The little princess celebrated her first birthday with a party at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. Guests included grandparents Prince Charles, and Carole and Michael Middleton. Kate and William released four new adorable photos of Charlotte playing happily at home to mark the occasion. One of the pictures, taken in the garden, shows her standing up while holding onto one of her toys.  A Kensington Palace spokesman said: The Duke and Duchess are delighted to share new photographs of Princess Charlotte. The Duchess took these pictures of her daughter in April at their home in Norfolk.  The Duke and Duchess are happy to be able to share these family moments, ahead of their daughteraposs first birthday. We hope that everyone enjoys these lovely photos as much as we do. Second birthday During her second year, we only saw little Charlotte a handful of times as her parents were keen to keep her out of the public eye. However they released another adorable photo of her to celebrate her birthday.  A spokesperson for the royal family said: Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank everyone for all of the lovely messages they have received, and hope that everyone enjoys this photograph of Princess Charlotte as much as they do. The photo was taken by mum Kate. Third birthday Princess Charlotte celebrated her third birthday just days after her little brother Prince Louis was born, so we imagine it was quite a quiet affair. A few days before her birthday the Queen fly to Kensington Palace in a helicopter to see her - and meet baby Louis. The family didnapost realise a new photo to celebrate, instead posting an old photo of the her on her first day at Willcocks Nursery School, taken by mum Kate. The tweet from the official Kensington Palace account said: Wishing a happy third birthday to Princess Charlotte – thank you all for your lovely messages! Fourth birthday Kate and Wills organised a special party for Charlotte to celebrate her fourth birthday. William revealed he would be hosting a celebration for his middle child when he made former Childrenaposs Laureate Julia Donaldson a CBE, during a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony.

Clune Park estate in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, housed hundreds of shipyard workers during the areaaposs golden age of shipbuilding in the s. However, it is now home to around  people living in a handful of the  flats. Property on the estate was once the cheapest in Britain, with one flat selling for just £, at auction - but it has been plagued by arsonists and vandals with shops, a primary school and church are all boarded up and abandoned. It is now dubbed aposmini Beirutapos and been described as aposat risk of catastrophic collapseapos. Over the past eight months, arsonists have started  fires there and thieves looking for scrap metal to sell have smashed through walls in abandoned buildings.  Leader of Inverclyde Council, Stephen McCabe, said: It is a decimated, isolated community. It is a blight on the landscape. It would remind you of somewhere like Chernobyl. However, plans to bulldoze the tenement blocks has resulted in a long and bitter battle between Inverclyde Council and private landlords refusing to sell up. Despite stark warnings that the conditions are not suitable for habitation, a handful of residents are clinging on - kept there either by the astonishingly low rents, or an unwillingness to leave.    With rents as low as £ for a one-bed flat, within easy reach of Glasgow, the estate has become an unlikely commuter belt for those brave enough to stay there. Julie Kane, , has lived on the estate for two-and-a-half years after moving from the idyllic Isle of Skye where she lived for more than  years. She pays £ per month for her one bedroom flat and despite thinking the area was like a aposmini Beirutapos when she moved in, she loves her home and finds the area apospeacefulapos. Julie, originally from Yorkshire, said: Iaposve got connections in Glasgow through family and was going to move into Glasgow city centre but the rents were outrageous.    Somebody said try over here and at first when I saw the place I thought aposOh my god, a mini Beirutapos. At that point there was a lot of complaints from tenants about drug addicts and things but the flat was brilliant for the price so I thought Iaposd give it six months and Iaposve been here ever since. I was like aposmy goodness, I can actually stay here and workapos, and have gone down to part-time because of my cheap rent. She would like to see the estate occupied by working people seeking affordable rents - and strongly believes money should be invested to bring the buildings up to scratch. Julie said: When I first moved in I was a bit wary, there were junkies and gangs on the street.    There was open prostitution and drugs going on, but thataposs all gone. Iaposve no fear of walking around - itaposs peaceful. But Inverclyde Council - which described the estate as a aposfestering woundapos and warned of a risk of aposcatastrophic collapseapos and apospotential tragedyapos - estimated ten years ago that costs of renovation would stretch to nearly £ million. The local authority has bought  of the flats and issued aposclosing ordersapos - meaning the homes cannot be inhabited - on another . Julie said: I look around and wonder why it was allowed to get in this state.    My tenement is full so weaposve got a lovely community there. Most of us are working in my block and Iaposd like to see more people come in like that who want affordable housing and want to work. In , a regeneration plan was agreed by the council, and three years later a compulsory demolition order was issued after the renovation of the flats was ruled out due to costs. But it was fought viciously by landlords owning  properties, around a quarter of the total - and in  a sherf revoked the order.    Jim Cameron, , who has lived on the estate all his le, said: All the houses were full when I stayed on Montgomery Street, then I got married and moved over the street. Maxwell Street used to be a good street but now itaposs a e. Despite warnings about the state of the buildings, Jim insisted: But itaposs safe. The local authority has gradually been buying up properties across the five blocks but some landlords have refused to sell up, demanding more cash.    Pensioner Marie Morrison, who has lived in the area for nearly  years, believes the warnings are justied but refuses to move regardless. She said: I donapost feel itaposs safe to live around here. These houses are going on fire quite regularly, there was one the other week. A lot of people are saying itaposs deliberate.    Councillor Michael McCormick, Convener of Inverclyde Councilaposs Environment and Regeneration Committee, said: In the councilaposs opinion all of the flats on the estate are Below the Tolerable Standard- they donapost meet the basic requirements to be classed as fit for people to live in. And the results of several, recent, independent surveys have done nothing to change this view. The poor physical and social conditions in the area, combined with the level of input required from Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue and Inverclyde Council, clearly shows that the private housing market has failed and that large-scale, planned intervention is urgently needed.

Oliver Clinch, now , was nicknamed aposaposChuckyaposapos due to his so-called resemblance to the voodoo doll from the Childaposs Play horror movies. Photographs of him taken  years apart show he still has the same smirk. At the age of just  Clinch became one of the youngest children in Britain to get an ASBO after he terrorised locals in his neighbourhood. But despite him being named and shamed by a court, Clinch has clocked up  offences on his record including criminal damage, harassment and assault. He was arrested again last November after he gave a man an unprovoked beating whilst drunk following a house party near his home in Little Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester.    Victim Paul Cauldwell suffered a broken nose, bruising and swelling to the face plus two lacerations to the left side of the forehead and a nasal fracture in the attack and feared losing his job due to time he took off work. At Bolton Crown Court, Clinch, who admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, faced jail and he even brought an overnight bag with him in the dock. But he escaped with a suspended sentence a judge said the community would aposaposbenefitaposapos from him addressing his behaviour with probation officers. In  police had said Clinch was a aposaposPied Piperaposapos who led a crowd of  other youngsters to watch him in action. Despite being in only Year eight at school and standing just ft ins tall, the youngster was said to be out of control on booze and behaved like an animal as he smashed windows, screamed racial abuse at an Asian shopkeeper and made sexual remarks towards women.    One officer spent  per cent of his time in one year dealing with the boyaposs crimes, which included daubing racist graffiti and telling a woman in a library to expose herself to him. He was said to have targeted the shopkeeper and his family at least  times, smashed the shop windows three times and drawn graffiti featuring his name outside the shop. Police received a string of complaints about Clinch spitting and swearing at passers by, making sexual remarks at teachers after being expelled from Little Lever High School. He was also accused of stealing lead from the school roof, smashing a bus station window, stealing a case of lager from an off licence and even assaulting his own aunt and driving her Fiat Brava off her driveway and into a road after she refused to take him to a friendaposs house.  He was later issued with an ASBO banning him from behaving badly for two years and officers issued a mugshot of his baby face describing him as a one-boy crimewave and a aposaposwalking timebomb.aposapos At the time Clinchaposs mother Victoria blamed her sonaposs behaviour on him having ADHD and smoking cannabis and said: Itaposs ridiculous to write someone off at  years old when they havenapost tried other solutions. The stigma of this will be with him forever and I donapost think he can come back to Bolton and lead a normal le after being labelled. What was said in court was unfair - itaposs wrong to brand a child of that age an animal. Heaposs such a loving boy.aposapos  The latest offence occurred after Clinch met Mr Caudwell by chance in Bolton town centre and they attended a party together. Prosecuting, Robert Smith said: “They’d known each other for some years and decided to go to a party where alcohol and drugs were being consumed. “After leaving the party the pair decided to go back to Mr Cauldwell’s house and continued to drink. This is where the assault occurred. The defendant attacked Mr Cauldwell punching his jaw and kicking at him with the victim falling to the floor. The defendant continued to punch and kick Mr Caldwell whilst he lay in a ball on the floor trying to protect himself. The defendant has  separate offences on his record, criminal damage, harassment, common assault, disorderly behaviour, drunk and disorderly, theft and threatening behaviour.” In a statement Mr Cauldwell said: “I was in a lot of pain following this incident. There was no explanation for the attack. I offered him somewhere to stay and that’s how I was repaid. I had to take time off work I was in so much pain. At one point I thought I may lose my job.”  In mitigation defence lawyer Simon Gurney said: “He does have antecedents but he thought he had put that past behind him. He has not been in trouble recently. This offence is isolated against that background - a couple of old friends drinking to excess and then play fighting which got out of hand. My client concedes he used excessive force and accepts this offence crosses the threshold. But he has had five years without offending and he hopes this has not undone the good work done in those five years.” Clinch was given  months jail suspended for two years and will be electronically tagged as part of a four month curfew from pm to am.

A Met Office yellow weather warning for rain will be in place in west Scotland today, between pm and midnight. Heavy rain and strong winds are expected in the area, with the potential for flooding and delays for drivers and bus and train passengers.

Derby Crown Court heard how the -year-old was acting out of this world in the Entertainer store at the mall, last December. A judge described her actions as terrying. CCTV footage showed how she approached two children in two separate incidents at the mall on the same day - grabbing one of them by the hand, before their mothers pulled them back, reports Derbyshire Live .    Both children were affected by the incidents, with one of the youngsters becoming clingy ever since, .  The court heard how Shepherd had several problems and had been prescribed an opiate-based painkiller. She had taken more than her prescribed amount earlier that day and had no recollection of the offences taking place. Judge Robert Egbuna, who presided over the case, described the offences as terrying, but said this was not a classic case of attempted kidnap and that it wasnapost pre-planned. He handed Shepherd a community order for her actions.    Stephen Kemp, prosecuting, said the first incident took place on December , and involved a mother and her daughter who were Christmas shopping.

Called the Cognitive Reflection Test, the quiz isnapost new, but was originally part of a research paper published in  by MIT professor Shane Frederick. This paper has recently resurfaced online, leaving many keen to give it a go. As part of his research, Professor Frederick had more than , participants from a range of educational backgrounds complete the test - and even those attending top American universities such as Yale and Hard struggled to work out all the answers. Of all those who took part only  percent managed to score three out of three on the test, meaning  percent of people failed - how will you fare     Speaking about the test, Professor Frederick, said: The three items on the CRT are aposeasyapos in the sense that their solution is easily understood when explained, yet reaching the correct answer often requires the suppression of an erroneous answer that springs aposimpulsivelyapos to mind.

This means the ball costs  cents and the bat costs . . If it takes  machines  minutes to make  widgets, then it takes  machine  minutes to make  widget .

But the cuddly black and white bear has made signicant progress in recent years, growing in numbers from about , in the s and , counted in . The good news meant the species’ threat level was downgraded from endangered to threatened in . And many credit Chinaaposs heightened efforts over the last decades to protect the panda population and its habitat with its ressurgence. Now, the Chinese government has gone further, creating a supersized national park for the bears. It which spans across the areas where the  known groups of pandas live.    Giant Panda National Park will cover , square miles of southwestern China - half the area of Wales and three times the size of Yellowstone National Park. The new park will restore and reconnect fragmented panda habitats in an effort to reunite bear populations that have become separated from each other. Conservationists believe that reunited giant panda groups will give them a better chance to breed, helping to boost numbers of the bear even further. One of the problems with protecting the pandas is that they have a very low reproductive rate, with females generally only fertile for one to three days each year. And they give birth usually only once every two years. But it is hoped the new park will give the bears room to roam and find mates, increasing their chances of survival.    Most of the park will be in Sichuan Province, home to more than  per cent of wild pandas, and where in  a huge magnitude  earthquake destroyed large swathes of panda habitat, as well as several pandas. This and other natural disasters, as well as logging, road construction, agriculture and human encroachment, have degraded the landscape and broken up populations. The mammal is now confined to to six mountain ranges and split into  groups, some of which have few than a dozen iniduals. Marc Brody, a founder of the ecotourism and conservation organisation Panda Mountain said he is pleased the Chinese government is “specically targeting habitat rather than focusing solely on the animals. “That’s why this park’s mission really matters. Habitat will remain patchy until degraded lands are restored and stronger land-use restrictions get enforced that make wildle corridors possible.” If such corridors become reality, “that will be the exciting legacy of this park,” he said.

Considering the dference in the size of clubs, full-time and part-time, we missed the best chances of the game as well.“I’m really delighted with the performance and at the end of the day it’s a useful point.“If we could get a result on Tuesday, nine points might be enough .”Trying to pinpoint the formula which has brought the Blue Toon’s hot start to the campaign, the boss added: “We haven’t brought too many players in.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

There are still spaces available in weeks five and six for both under-s in the morning lessons and adults in the afternoon lessons.Last weekend also saw the club hosting Cushendall Sailing Club for theleg of their annual race.The club’s relationship with Cushendall goes back more than  years with both clubs visiting each other every year and holding a yacht race with the inidual winner over both legs winning the North Channel Shield and a prize for the winning team.This year there was no race when Campbeltown visited Cushendall as there was not enough wind and so all was to play for when the race began last Saturday afternoon.This year#s inidual winner was James Farrell, skipper of Sigmania, a Sigma  from Cushendall. A worthy winner, James is a highly experienced sailor and has coached the Northern Ireland dinghy sailors at international level. The team prize also went to Cushendall.The event is not all about the yacht race, as the social side is also very enjoyable and friendships have been made and sustained over the years.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo.

The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10164630.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Some young women suffered worse fates: an explosion killed one local girl, others lost arms and fingers or were severely burned due to the fires which could break out. Their work and leisure lives were strictly monitored: everything came under the official secrets act and over  members of the Womenrsquos Police Service monitored their movements and morals!The museum is set across two floors with interactive displays including films, games and oral testimonies of people from World War One and Two. There is so much military history in this part of Scotland that it has been named lsquoThe Solway Military Coastrsquo and the upstairs in the museum the story continues into World War Two in this region and even includes a look at the start of the Cold War with a virtual reality headset experience to explore inside Chapelcross, Scotlandrsquos first nuclear power station.The Devilrsquos Porridge Museum regularly tops Dumfries and Gallowayrsquos things to do on Tripadvisor and has recently been shortlisted for the prestigious lsquoMost Family Friendly Museum in the UK Award.rsquoVisit the website, Facebook, Twitteror Instagram.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Philiphaugh EstateSituated just to the North and West of the Royal Burgh of Selkirk lies Philiphaugh Estate, perhaps best known for the Civil War battle fought between the Marquis of Montrose for the Royalistsand General Leslie of the Covenanterson  September .

Any sensible organisation would confirm something as serious as that. I got an email a while after saying theyrsquod be in touch within  days, but it took a couple of months for anyone to actually get in touch with me. When they did eventually, they just said they were looking at it.\"Irsquove had to phone for an update every month, but they just say it is still under investigation. The original case worker who was dealing with it was one of the women in the Panorama programme, so when she left she got replaced by someone  but I wasnrsquot told who that was.\"I know for a fact at least one, maybe two others have complained about him as well.\"It is causing me a signicant amount of stress, but I am that determined to make sure this is dealt with. He is taking up more of my free time than I would like him to, trying to build up and collect all this evidence, and theyrsquove done absolutely nothing by the looks of it. Nothing whatsoever.\"Following the members complaint, but before Gregson was suspended from Labour, he brought forward a motion at the Edinburgh Central branch ,meeting calling for the group to object to Labours definition of anti-Semitism,He also called for an \"end to disciplinary actions against any affected member, shop steward, Labourist or employee accused of anti-Semitism under this definition\".The whistleblower said: \"When he brought forward this motion I was even more angry, as I knew I had complained, and others had complained, and yet he was able to just bring forward this motion to the branch.\"Sadly it is situations like this which are causing Labour to lose face. \"I fear the party as it was before the days of Jeremy Corbyn is pretty much lost for a generation now.\"I joined the party because I believed in their principles of wanting to help everyone and treat everybody equally. I joined to fight for things like that, not to fight other members. I donrsquot want to be part of an organisation that doesnrsquot take this seriously and is basically dominated by people who I believe are either anti-Semitic or borderline anti-Semitic themselves.\"A Labour Party spokesman said: \"The Labour Party takes all complaints of antisemitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.\"All complaints about antisemitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.

Paper, cardboard and other materials were either recycled or sent to a digester and erted from landfill.Ian Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: ldquoHebCelt has been a leader in recent years for more environmentally friendly festivals through the introduction of reusable cups and other measures, such as the decision to ban single-use plastic and use recyclable and biodegradable alternatives instead.ldquoThese moves show a step in the right direction as single-use packaging is often a problem at large-scale events.ldquoThe environmental impact from this type of large-scale event can be reduced by removing any unnecessary item or replacing it with a re-usable alternative.Greenpeace estimates that around . million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans each year across the world, and green charities from across the country say while festivals play a large part in contributing to plastic waste they also raise awareness of its environmental impact.ldquoIt is great to see Hebridean Celtic Festival continuing to take action to reduce their climate and environmental impact, said climate campaigner of Friends of Earth Scotland Caroline Rance.ldquoAll business and institutions must take steps to signicantly cut their use of fossil fuels and lessen their organisationrsquos contribution to climate change.ldquoFestivals, and the arts more widely, have a really important role in engaging people in these important issues and inspiring them to take action.ldquoHebCelt was ahead of the curve in banning plastic straws and introducing reusable cups five years ago, and banning single-use plastic last year.ldquoPlastic pollution is a huge problem which has really captured the public attention, but plastics are indicative of larger problems of our throwaway society that fails to make products that last.ldquoMuch of a festivalrsquos impact comes from transport, and, whilst a festival in the Hebrides presents unique logistical and transport challenges, we would encourage festival organisers to keep thinking about how to get more people to reduce the impact of their journey.Although HebCelt appears to have been ahead of the curve, Ms Maclennan says there is still more to be done.To this end, the festival has joined forces with Tighean Innse Gall , the housing and energy agency for the Outer Hebrides, to help raise awareness of climate change.ldquoWe want to continue to improve our actions and spread the word amongst our audience, artists and contractors, Ms Maclennan said. ldquoThis year, our partnership with TIG will help get the message out to more people which can only help us in our ongoing aims.Not only were the team on site to talk to revellers about the environment, they also supplied an electric Tesla car to drive main headline act KT Tunstall and others to the festival site. ldquoI applaud HebCeltrsquos efforts to tackle environmental issues and raise awareness amongst an international audience, Tunstall said.ldquoWith the help of TIG this year, they are helping to bring important issues to the attention of thousands of people which can only help in the fight against climate change.And it appears other events across the country are also making the switch to more environmentally friendly alternatives to some of the most damaging materialsZero Wastersquos Mr Gulland said: ldquoWersquove grown accustomed to the pictures of piles of litter and waste left behind after festivals, but we are increasingly seeing it does not have to be this way.Mr Gulland added: ldquoThis year, many organisers have noticeably ramped up their sustainability efforts. Glastonbury succeeded in convincing campers to take their tents home and TRNSMT operated a deposit scheme for cups and bottles.Earlier this month, at Glasgowrsquos TRNSMT festival, a deposit scheme was introduced whereby revellers to encourage used cups, made of paper, back to a kiosk to get their p paid at point of purchase.Annually, those attending Glastonbury go through over one million plastic bottles annually, and this year the festival scrapped the offending materials entirely.In Glasgow, summer festival TRNSMT introduced a cupscheme, wherein revelers were asked to bring used drinks cups ndash made of paper ndash to a dedicated kiosk, in exchange for a p deposit paid at point of purchase.Glasgowrsquos TRNSMT aims to remove plastic from its site completely by  and took signicant steps this year by reducing single use plastics and introducing more water refill points."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes-former-msp-trish-godman","story":"Ms Godman represented West Renfrewshire from  until her retirement in , and was Holyroods deputy presiding officer for eight years.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described Ms Godman as \"determined and principled\".He tweeted: \"On behalf of the Scottish Labour Party, I extend our condolences on the sad news of the death of former Scottish Labour MSP and deputy Presiding Officer Trish Godman.\"Determined and principled, Trish was a great fighter for her constituents and for the Labour Party.

The House of Commons is now very well placed to say whether or not the concept of Brexit placed before the voters at the time of the referendum is still defensible, and henceone can reasonably refer to the will of the people as expressed at that time as still being relevant. Accordingly I believe that a free vote ndash a vote of conscience ndash by the House of Commons, should be held, with two clear options: either to abandon the process of leaving the European Union, or to continue on a path to departure. This move would place Members of Parliament in their proper position as inidual elected representatives in a representative democracy of deciding on behalf of all their constituents which path to follow. Before the vote MPs should, I consider, be reminded that as they represent all their constituents , they must put aside party and personal predilections, and vote on what they believe, in conscience, is in the best interests of all of their constituents, of all of the people of the United Kingdom and of the concept of a peaceful Europe. An analogy would be the vote on the abolition of capital punishment.As there has been ample opportunity for debate prior to this pivotal point, I suggest that the making of speeches before a vote might be ruled out, other than a statement setting out procedure.Professor John R Hume, Glasgow G.THIS may be too obvious to say, but somebody has to: opposition to the Tories is tragically split. The more people change to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, the more secure the Tories become.In one General Election, the SNP took all the seats in Scotland except one. Did that get the Tories out Whatever you say about Labour right now, the party is all wersquove got. If it won all its seats, the Tories would be out.We have to accept that some people have curious enthusiasms. I cannot believe that any adult would care where a ball lands, but there it is. I cannot believe anybody would be excited about his inadvertent birthplace, but there it is, and it includes my best friends.Now Labour says it is turning Remain. Its leaders must have been reading my letters.My favourite dream is one huge united anti-Tory party, who would concentrate on socialism and European membership, setting aside meantime, anti-Semitism and kne crime. Oh, and Scottish independence.Mrs Moyna Gardner, Glasgow G.Itrsquos a pity these measures werenrsquot taken right across the th century, when Scotlandrsquos economy was directly controlled from London, and suffered much lower growth rates than the UK. As one banker put it some years ago: ldquoScotland was in recession for  years.GR Weir, Ochiltree.MANY people are critical of our politicians, with good reason, but the underlying causes of their poor performance are not clear.One possibility is that the political approach to decision-making is derived from the legal system. Unfortunately, the practice of deciding outcomes by persuasive argument is not always fit for purpose outside the courtroom. Global warming will dominate le on earth for the foreseeable future and no amount of discussion or debate will change this, yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer insists on pointing out that the costs are very high, with the implication that we should continue burning coal, oil and gas. Of course the costs are high, but the alternatives even in the medium term are much worse.Brexit is a classic example of a decision that should be made following a determined and honest attempt to establish the facts and to make those facts public. Instead we have groups of people who think that they can win an argument, based purely on rhetoric. Evenmany of the outcomes are uncertain, there should be a process of evaluation that is not based on \"winning\" or \"losing\".A second possible reason for Westminster politicians to be so incompetent is that many are very poorly educated. To go from an expensive private school to Oxford, where  weeks a year for three years may be spent studying a subject of little or no practical relevance to le on this planet, is not a useful preparation for decision-making in a technically complex world. This is exacerbated by going straight into politics, buoyed by a high level of self-confidence and not the smallest notion of what le is like for those who have to earn a living. Perhaps the worst aspect of this career path is that the ones who end up leading the pack are those with the most confidence, not the clearest thinkers.A third possible reason is that Oxford graduates tend to go back to their professors for advice. If the professors are purely theoretical in their analyses they will be unable to reflect the realities of le and all the real world uncertainties that affect the outcomes of policy decisions.A fourth potential reason is that le in politics is very stressful. This seems to lead to a kind of febrile state, in which the politician loses all contact with reality le becomes a merry-go-round, based on lies and pretence, with the object to become famous rather than to serve.These observations are not specic to one party or another. Whichever way you look at it, the Westminster system needs to be reformed.Roger Waigh, Helensburgh.FOR months you have given over a complete page to letters on Brexit even though Holyrood estimates the financial impact on Scotland will be around pound billion a year.

Not only were the team from VisitScotland a great bunch to work with but the countryside we crossed in pursuit of our payload is one of the most beautul and dramatic landscapes we’ve visited. “Once the Coosmonaut was back in our hands, we were genuinely sad to leave and head back to England.”A new tourism map highlighting Scotland’s links to space exploration and the first moonwalk has also been released.On the new trail...among the Scottish landmarks on the new VisitScotland map is the dark sky observatory in Dalmellington, Ayrshire.The Scotland is Out of this World trail is part of the new VisitScotland campaign of the same name.The trail features Scottish connections to each planet in the solar system, as well as fun facts and details of science centres and the best places to stargaze.Highlights incude:data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.berwickshirenews webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BERN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BERN | Article Teaser\"Mars – Glenelg, Highlands: In  the village twinnedwith a geological feature on Mars, called Glenelg.Jupiter – Loch Airigh, Isle of Harris: The loch in the Outer Hebrides portrays the planet Jupiter in the  Stanley Kubrick directed film, : A Space Odyssey.Uranus – Braemar: The birthplace of Johann von Lamont, an astronomer who calculated the mass of Uranus.Neptune – Jedburgh, Scottish Borders: The birthplace of th century science writer Mary Somerville who theorised that dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus may point to an undiscovered planet, which inspired the discovery of Neptune.Venus – Parton, Dumfries and Galloway: The resting place of th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, whose name was given to Maxwell Montes, the planet’s only feature named after a man.The Scotland is Out of this World campaign marks the th anniversary of the Apollo  mission and US astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the lunar surface.But it also celebrates the th anniversary of VisitScotland.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive, said: “For  years VisitScotland has helped position Scotland as a must-visit destination to audiences across the world.“It is therefore fitting that in our anniversary year we set our sights even further and travelled into space in what can only be described as a truly out of this world campaign.“Scotland is Out of this World offered the opportunity to delve into the past and celebrate the country’s contribution to space exploration and its ancestral links to one of the greatest moments in history.“The new trail reveals some of the country’s stellar attractions and locations to visit to firmly cement Scotland’s place in astro-tourism. “After all, our best views aren’t confined to our awe-inspiring landscapes but reach up high into the night sky above as well.”Ohio-born Neil Armstrong was proud of his Scottish heritage.

Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “HIAL’s commitment to access for all passengers has been recognised for a third year by the CAA, acknowledging the hard work by all our staff to ensure our airports are as inclusive as possible.#As an organisation, we work with local disability organisations and iniduals to ensure we are always improving our offerings to better meet their needs and provide assistance where required.“For Kirkwall to be listed as Very Good in its first year of reaching the required passenger threshold is a testament to the hard work staff put in to accommodate disabled and mobility restricted passengers.“Kirkwall has made several upgrades to its facilities for those with additional needs in recent years including changing the flooring in the security area from carpet to lino and adding additional counter space in disabled toilets.“We continue to invest and improve and will provide staff with additional disabilities training.#The CAA’s framework was introduced to ensure there is a consistent and high-quality service for disabled passengers across UK airports. The CAA assesses airports against a number of measures to establish how well they are performing for disabled passengers.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It replaces outdated software applications or even paper-based systems and is the only product of its type available on the market.The simple and easy to use interface connects directly with employees in real time and offers the company a simple overview and analytics of the crew pool.NorthLink, has around  marine staff who, alongside the crewing department, will benefit directly from the innovation.Ankaa Ltd is a new company set up by marine specialist employment firm Clyde Marine Recruitment, which has been managing seafarers for almost four decades. NorthLink Ferries’ two freight vessels, Helliar and Hildasay, were instrumental in the product development and field testing.Ian Livingstone, managing director of Ankaa, said: “The maritime community has always been challenged with effectively managing, sharing and ensuring validity of seafarer’s data. This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations. Usually this is for the benefit of our customers. But on this occasion, we’re pleased to be doing something directly for our staff, ensuring that we keep up with technology and bring the benefits of digital services to our unique workplace. This is a proven solution to something that affects every maritime operator and we’re proud to be in at the start of a transformation in crew management.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Lead author Professor Sophie Scott, from University College London, said: ldquoIrsquom fascinated that not only does laughter make the joke seem funnier, but that the more spontaneous the laughter, the funnier it makes the joke.In the study,  groan-worthy dad jokes were given a baseline humour rating of between one ndash not funny ndash and seven ndash hilarious.Participants were asked to rate how funny the jokes were when read aloud by a professional comedian.Two versions were created adding short canned ndash or posed ndash laughter and short spontaneous ndash or real ndash laughter.Researchers deliberately chose weaker jokes so they could avoid ceiling effects when determining any influence of laughter.What does a dinosaur use to pay the bills  Tyrannosaurus cheques!Whats orange and sounds like a parrot  A carrot!What do you call a man with a spade on his head  Dug! Both versions of the jokes were tested on  neurotypical iniduals and  autistic iniduals in the study published in the Current Biology journal.Laughter may be processed dferently in autism, as typically developing childrenrsquos enjoyment of cartoons is enhanced by laughter tracks, watching with another or simulating a smile.In contrast, autistic childrenrsquos enjoyment is not signicantly adjusted by such manipulations.Prof Scott said: ldquoWhat this study shows is that adding laughter to a joke increases the humour value, no matter how funny or unfunny the joke is.ldquoIt also suggests we respond much better to spontaneous genuine laughter, rather than posed or canned laughter, showing the inherent human joy and value of a natural response.Both groups gave higher funniness ratings for jokes paired with spontaneous laughter than with posed laughter.The only dference was that those with autism gave all  dad jokes an increased funniness rating when laughter was added. The research team at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience said this may be because neurotypical adults were more aware these dad jokes are considered childish and uncool.Some of the jokes included in the study were:ndash What does a dinosaur use to pay the bills  Tyrannosaurus cheques!ndash Whatrsquos orange and sounds like a parrot  A carrot!ndash What do you call a man with a spade on his head  Dug!Prof Scott added: ldquoThis research shows that while canned laughter does elevate the humour of a comedy, adding real laughter would get a better response.ldquoThis has been adopted in shows like Friends, which are recorded in front of an audience, with the real laughter amplied during editing for particular jokes that had been well received.copy -.

During their whistle stop tours of the land, much of the talk has, naturally, been about Brexit, our relationship with the United States and promises of tax cuts for iniduals and businesses.While these issues may capture the imagination of the , Tory party members, who are deciding who will be our next PM, there are plenty of other pressing matters that the next resident of No  Downing Street will need to keep in mind. Ensuring that everybody has access to a good workplace pension is one of them.As it stands, there are more people saving in a pension than at any time in our history. This is down to the success of auto-enrolment pensions – a policy that has welcomed some  million new pensions savers since .It has been a genuine success. So far. But there is more to do. Contributions from inidual workers and their employers have gradually been rising from a low base, reaching eight per cent of salary in April of this year.Monitoring how employees have responded to the April increase is crucial before any further tweaks are made to auto-enrolment policy.Westminster itself recognises the need for improvement. The  Auto Enrolment Review endorsed the case for making pensions contributions count from the first pound of salary, rather than anything after £,. This would have a material effect on the prospects of lower and middle-income workers building up a decent sized pot for retirement. But no timetable has yet emerged for implementation.Politics is in flux of course and commitments can fall by the wayside. But this delay is sensible. Auto-enrolment has worked so far because it has been evidence-based. It would also be important to stage gradually the implementation of a “contributions from the first pound earned” policy because of its greater impact on lower earners.More immediately, the government should consider measures to bring the benefits of auto-enrolment pension saving to more women.Women make up only around a third of those auto-enrolled so far. Reducing the “enrolment trigger” from £, a year from one job to the primary National Insurance threshold level – £, – would bring the benefits of auto-enrolment to another half a million people, three-quarters of whom would be women.This would help auto-enrolment play its full role in tackling the gender pensions gap. As things stand the average woman retires with a pension income £, less than her male counterpart. Women more often take a break from full-time work to raise a family, with a long-term knock on effect on their pension savings. More affordable and accessible childcare would help the four in  women who have said they would like to work more hourschildcare was more accessible.One bright idea is to encourage childcare businesses to open in town centres – a move which would help both Messrs Hunt and Johnson achieve their stated aim of “saving the High Street”.While I don’t believe for one second that either candidate will spend the coming days discussing the vagaries of auto-enrolment pensions, they will do well to remember that people really do need a guiding hand when it comes to securing their future.Gregg McClymont is head of policy at The People’s Pension and former shadow pensions minister.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again.

And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the .

This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per month out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rte to broadcast glenanne film","story":"RTÉ is to broadcast a documentary by a West Belfast film-maker about the notorious loyalist Glenanne Gang, believed to be responsible for over  sectarian killings of Catholics during the Troubles, mainly in counties Armagh and Tyrone.Unquiet Graves will air next week, July  at .pm.The Glenanne Gang, which also contained members of the legal British Army UDR among its number, was also responsible for the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which killed  civilians in May , as well as the Miama Showband massacre in .Seán Murray’s film– which is narrated by the Oscar-nominated actor Stephen Rea – has previously been shown at An Chultúrlann and at the Movie House cinema in Belfast.Murray tweeted: “I can now announce that Unquiet Graves will be screening on RTÉ  on Monday the th of July at .pm. “This is of immense importance to the #Glenanne families# and is a major milestone on the road to justice.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38334275.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/download.jpg","title":"razor blades placed on belfast cycle path","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime. There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

Derry is already not just a walled city but a world city.A Derry university freed from the shackles of UU would attract students and academic talent from around the world.Pleading for a medical school in terms which suggest that that’s all we want falls far short of what’s needed.

That’s not going to happen without a stronger, bigger, more determined movement for change.UU shted , students from Jordanstown into overcrowded Belfast - without any consideration of transferring some of the departments concerned to Derry.In fact, Derry wasn’t even considered.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

Most LCGs recorded percentages below  while the Western Trust consistently registered a score below % during that period, something that hadnt happened in the eight months prior.Category B are serious but not le-threatening calls and require a response within  minutes and category C calls are neither le threatening or serious and require a response within  minutes.Over the past year % of journeys in the Western area were deemed emergencies while the rest were non-emergencies.‘Competing priorities’In response to claims that the ambulance cover in Derry is insufficient and the service in general is facing serious funding pressures, the department of health said it looks to the NIAS to ensure that sufficient ambulance cover is provided throughout NI.A spokeswoman explained: \"The Department recognises that demand for ambulance services is currently outstripping the available resources.\"We are currently considering the outcome of a public consultation by NIAS on a new clinical response model whichintroduced will ensure that that the most ill patients requiring an ambulance will be seen quickly as well as improving the overall efficiency of response times.”She continued: \"This new service model will require signicant investment which will have to be found within the Department’s budget against other competing priorities for investment in health and social care services.\"Ahead of decisions to be taken on the new service model later this year the Department has committed to putting more paramedics on the ground and is funding  training places from its transformation fund.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"sunrise sunset powys county times camera club members","story":"They#re still hungry, records Martin Jones.\" Sunrise to sunset... out and aboutGrasses on the Dyfnant Rainbow Walks at Llangadfan from Toni Mannell.\" Sunrise to sunset... out and aboutHoping for some food...

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area. This is a situation which calls for immediate action by all relevant government departments, public bodies and interested parties to encourage, promote and attract new employment to the area, he added.BRYANSFORD mdash On a day when there were ten separate attacks on Post Office property throughout the province, Bryansford Post Office was the target for a terrorist bomb and several post office cables in the area were cut.Last Tuesday the telephone operator received an anonymous callfrom a male at .am warning that a bomb had been planted at the post office.Local police went to the scene where they found that a booby-trap bomb had been left in a waste paper basket outside. An Army technical officer later arrived and the bomb was successfully defused.Around the same time Post Office cables were cut at Dromara Road and Castlewellan Road in Clough.NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastle would be overwhelmed by a wave of crime and vice during the holiday period proved unfounded, with the resort enjoying an ldquoextremely quiet period.The RUC said before the Twelfth holidays began that they would be swamping the provincersquos major holiday resorts, including Newcastle, in a bid to crack down on the growing problems of teenage drinking and drug-taking.Newcastle had no major incidents or arrests, except for four Belfast youths who are helping police with their inquiries into shoplting at the Gt House of Mourne on July .A police spokesman stressed, however, that patrols were stepped up during the holiday period, especially during weekends, chiefly because the population of the resort doubled during the summer months.Police said violence was the most common side effect of teenage drinking and they had asked publicans, off licence owners and hotels to be extra vigilant.The spokesman added that the police determination to crack down could only succeed with the help of the people who sold the drink.KILLYLEAGH mdash The Dunmore Hotel in Killyleagh changed hands over the holiday period and it may also be changing its name. The new owners are Mr Paul Green and his we Nancy, from Killinchy, and they have taken over the hotel from Mr Harry Briggs.The hotel was sold for an undisclosed sum of money, but it is believed to be in six figures. The new owners intend to extend and renovate the hotel, but hope that all work can be carried out without closing down the hotel.The short term plans include adding nine new bedrooms at the rear and extensively renovating the present accommodation.The owners intend to keep the present name for the time being, but they are contemplating reverting to the original name of the hotel, lsquoThe Treesrsquo.STRANGFORD mdash Shore sports proved every bit as popular as the sailing events at Strangford Regatta last week.Hundreds of holidaymakers flocked to the village to watch people of all age groups taking part in a host of events in the hot summer sun.The wide spectrum of events made it a day of fierce competition and fun for competitors and spectators alike and the organisers say they were amazed at the success of the sporting programme.Events included a fancy dress competition, round the houses race, rowing race and races for married men and women. Amusements were also provided for the children.PORTAFERRY mdash The Strangford to Portaferry swim was one of the highlights of Portaferry Gala Week, which began on Sunday and continues through until Saturday.The swim against the current, which is believed to be one of the fastest in Europe, took the most out of all eight competitors, who ranged in age from  to .But for Jacqui McIntyre, of Bangor Swimming Club, the swim proved comparatively easy. With her time of  minutes and  seconds, she won the ladiesrsquo section and also recorded the fastest time overall.The gala began on Sunday with a fun run and boat sea angling competition. It concludes this Saturday with the final of the talent competition and an open air dance.MOURNES mdash The Mourne Mountains are alive to the sound of music mdash music with a message which is about building bridges across the world.The area was the cockpit for an international roadshow arranged and rehearsed at break-neck speed around camp fires.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome. Empty properties are detrimental to the lives of local residents.ldquoThey are often a magnet for crime and continue to blight neighbourhoods. They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years. In April , the St Augustinersquos ward in Penarth had the most long-term empty homes, with  empty for more than six months and  for more than two years.Penarthrsquos Plymouth ward had more than  empty for more than six months, and more than  empty for more than two years.The proposed strategy calls on the council to maintain and improve its empty homes data, provide financial incentives to landlords, prioritise empty homes for enforcement action such as enforced sales and compulsory purchase orders, and to raise awareness of the issue of empty homes.The strategy says: ldquoA voluntary way forward to renovation and re-occupation is always the preferred option, and officers make all available endeavours to encourage and persuade such progress.ldquoHowever, in instances where owners cannot be traced or where exhaustive attempts to encourage and promote progress from known owners prove unproductive, orthere is an imminent risk to health and safety, there is little option but to proceed with a statutory solution,The draft empty homes strategy will be put to public consultation after the councilrsquos August recess. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Lead author Professor Sophie Scott, from University College London, said: ldquoIrsquom fascinated that not only does laughter make the joke seem funnier, but that the more spontaneous the laughter, the funnier it makes the joke.In the study,  groan-worthy dad jokes were given a baseline humour rating of between one ndash not funny ndash and seven ndash hilarious.Participants were asked to rate how funny the jokes were when read aloud by a professional comedian.Two versions were created adding short canned ndash or posed ndash laughter and short spontaneous ndash or real ndash laughter.Researchers deliberately chose weaker jokes so they could avoid ceiling effects when determining any influence of laughter.What does a dinosaur use to pay the bills  Tyrannosaurus cheques!Whats orange and sounds like a parrot  A carrot!What do you call a man with a spade on his head  Dug! Both versions of the jokes were tested on  neurotypical iniduals and  autistic iniduals in the study published in the Current Biology journal.Laughter may be processed dferently in autism, as typically developing childrenrsquos enjoyment of cartoons is enhanced by laughter tracks, watching with another or simulating a smile.In contrast, autistic childrenrsquos enjoyment is not signicantly adjusted by such manipulations.Prof Scott said: ldquoWhat this study shows is that adding laughter to a joke increases the humour value, no matter how funny or unfunny the joke is.ldquoIt also suggests we respond much better to spontaneous genuine laughter, rather than posed or canned laughter, showing the inherent human joy and value of a natural response.Both groups gave higher funniness ratings for jokes paired with spontaneous laughter than with posed laughter.The only dference was that those with autism gave all  dad jokes an increased funniness rating when laughter was added. The research team at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience said this may be because neurotypical adults were more aware these dad jokes are considered childish and uncool.Some of the jokes included in the study were:ndash What does a dinosaur use to pay the bills  Tyrannosaurus cheques!ndash Whatrsquos orange and sounds like a parrot  A carrot!ndash What do you call a man with a spade on his head  Dug!Prof Scott added: ldquoThis research shows that while canned laughter does elevate the humour of a comedy, adding real laughter would get a better response.ldquoThis has been adopted in shows like Friends, which are recorded in front of an audience, with the real laughter amplied during editing for particular jokes that had been well received..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Laugh tracks make dad jokes funnier, study suggests article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
