But in fact this is all guesswork.There simply has not been enough time to establish any of these things. While we wait to know, measured and targeted precautions are sensible.They are relatively easy to remove if they prove to be needless, and equally easy to retain if they are justified. It is not as if we cannot react quickly to any crisis, when it comes.If any of these dangers turns out to be real, we have in this country a superb vaccine research capacity, and we have demonstrated the ability to respond with great speed and efficiency when called to do so.By contrast, a renewal of restrictions on work and daily life would be enormously difficult to lift once imposed, as experience clearly shows. There would be so many voices warning that it was too soon to take the risk, so Ministers would hesitate endlessly. It could be months before we were again free of such curbs.So calls from some quarters for the return of restrictions to our national life should be treated with caution. We now know that such measures carry a heavy price tag.The NHS will take many months to recover from the effects on it of the last lockdown, when vast numbers of people missed vital treatments and tests. The mental health of the old and lonely has already taken enough blows. How dismal it would be for them to be stuck in a renewed lockdown, especially at a time of year when so many look forward to family gatherings around the Christmas tree.The economy is now bursting into full life again, but this is largely because of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s bold and praiseworthy decision to liberate the country from shutdowns and closures at the earliest sensible moment.It is as well to remember that many criticised this decision. Yet other countries that retained tight restrictions have in fact suffered from redoubled outbreaks of the disease, whereas the English figures, for now, remain gratifyingly low.As winter gets under way with all its dangers to health, it may be hard to argue that Mr Johnson\u0027s policies have solved the problem. But it is far harder to argue that they have failed, or proved to be rash.We have our freedom back. Our economy is booming, education is at last returning to normal, daily life is resuming, the Health Service is working hard to catch up with its backlog, growing numbers have been able to take foreign holidays and fly abroad to see long-missed relatives.The time may come when there is good reason to sacrifice all these gains. If it does, then we will be the first to support them.But let us not rush into any such action. Any fool can panic, but the task of the real statesman is to be calm."},{"url":null,"title":"Chinese CCTV monitoring Britons 275 000 networks identified five Uighur camps","story":"Share this article London holds the largest number at 61,504, followed by Birmingham with 8,865, Manchester with 7,436 and Liverpool with 4,957, according to researchers at TOP10VPN. Last week it emerged that the Government is using hundreds of Hikvision cameras across the Department for Health, Department for Work and Pensions, and Ministry of Justice. This is despite a Freedom of Information request by the campaign group Free Tibet that uncovered official Ministry of Defence guidance warning \u0027not to use  install Hikvision equipment\u0027. And last week the MoS revealed the Home Office had faced a security scare after discovering a CCTV unit in its London HQ manufactured by Dahua. Authorities in the US fear the companies\u0027 camera technology present a national security concern because of their links to the Chinese state, which the firms\u0027 bosses strongly deny. Both Hikvision and Dahua\u0027s cameras and technology has been used in the repression of the Muslim minority Uighurs in China. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, of the China Research Group, said: \u0027I have been calling for the UK government to ban Hikvision and Dahua cameras for months - not least stripping it from Government departments and local councils. \u0027This is yet more evidence why we urgently need to rip this insidious technology from our country to protect our civil liberties. \u0027It is unacceptable for even a penny of taxpayers\u0027 money to go to an arm of the Chinese state, one actively facilitating the genocide of the Uighur people in Xinjiang.\u0027 Earlier this month the Government brought its revised camera surveillance code before Parliament but failed to include a human rights clause blocking the purchase of equipment from firms linked to human rights abuses. Fraser Sampson, England and Wales\u0027s Biometric and Surveillance Camera Commissioner, said: \u0027From what little they\u0027ve said publicly it seems Hikvision would like to adopt a \u0027fire and forget\u0027 approach and disown any responsibility for what is done with their systems once they\u0027ve designed and installed them.\u0027 Hikvision supplies CCTV cameras to British schools, police forces, government departments, local councils, hospitals, care homes and private companies. Hikvision declined to comment while Dahua did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Priti Patel doing two years prevent Channel crossings","story":"Share this articlePriti Patel’s fury as bitter blame game breaks out over Channel migrant deaths | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Covid Australia TWO confirmed cases Omicron Sydney","story":"Share this articleCall for five-day mandatory hotel quarantine to stop omicronVictoria coronavirus: Omicron cases lead Andrews government to consider extending quarantine for international arrivalsNSW COVID: Omicron lands in Sydney as hotel quarantine back on the cardsCOVID Victoria: Anxiety tipped to surge as Omicron arrives in Australia"},{"url":null,"title":"step up the artist fixated on feet in pictures","story":"You may be relieved to hear that, although she has a collection of “magical” secondhand shoes, Litovka mainly wears trainers. “In my normal life it’s about the eyes and being an artist, not my feet.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab512d0e138053a751a5289411ddf6db3760317/0_169_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8d43e5dd5846650c385de096771948ca","title":"chelsea v manchester united premier league live","story":"While Rangnick would love to be in charge today, it might not be the worst game to miss.

Re8 was part of that thinking, Carlsen expounds on his opening-stage surprise. “Yeah, Re8 is a really, really dumb move because usually you would try to go Re8 without d6,” he says. “But it turns out even here he was well prepared and he didn’t give me even slight chances to play.” He adds: “It’s good to get a rest day (on Monday). Now I’ve had two black games so far so the result is OK, but obviously I’ve got to create some chances at some point.” The engines say Carlsen’s best move is for the light-squared bishop to return to its home square (Bc3), but that’s an awfully difficult move to find without the aid of computer study. But if anyone is capable of sussing it out ... ... and indeed Carlsen does, playing 17. ... Bc8 after a five-minute think. After a brief spell, Nepomniachtchi and elects to recapture with his knight (15. Nxc4) Nepomniachtchi takes more than four minutes before responding with 11. Nf1. Carlsen counters with 11. ... h6.The time control for each game is 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, 60 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61. If the match is tied after 14 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day (16 December) in the following order: • Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. • If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). • If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner. Notably, Carlsen’s second and third title defenses both came down to tiebreakers. But many believe the increased length of this year’s match (from 12 to 14 games) and the stylistic matchup at hand promises a decisive result in regulation.The general consensus around today’s highly anticipated third encounter is that both Nepomniachtchi (who will be marshaling the white pieces) and Carlsen (playing with black) will have a real go at a decisive result before the first rest day of the match on Monday. For those of you just coming aboard, Carlsen, 30, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Nepomniachtchi, 31, is ranked No 5, having earned his place at the table by winning the eight-man candidates tournament in April with a round to spare. It’s the culmination of a rivalry that started nearly two decades ago when they first met across the board as boys at the 2002 European Under-12 Championship in Peniscola, Spain. Notably, Nepomniachtchi enters the title tilt with a winning lifetime record against Carlsen in classical matches (four won, one lost and eight drawn). That makes him unique among today’s top players, even if two of those victories came in youth championships. We’re a little more than a half hour from today’s first move, so not much longer now. In the meantime here’s our Sean Ingle’s interview with Carlsen from earlier this week.

It noted the spread of Omicron in Africa and Europe, AP reports. Morocco kept its borders closed for months in 2020 because of the pandemic, fearing that its health system would not be able to manage the surges of patients seen in Europe. Gathered in a park overlooking the Czech capital’s centre, protesters waved national flags and carried signs with slogans such as: “Get vaccinated? Over your dead bodies”. The outgoing government toughened measures on Thursday, including a ban on Christmas markets, which was one of the main themes at Sunday’s rally. “I am here to fight for freedom. I am here because I don’t agree with what is happening today,” Jiri Hulec told Reuters. Czech hospitals, including the largest one, Prague’s Motol, have ceased planned operations and limited other care in the past days as the number of patients with Covid-19 has doubled to around 6,000 over the past three weeks. Dr Anthony Fauci told ABC News on Sunday that the United States must do “anything and everything” amid likely cases of the variant, but it was “too early to say” whether new lockdowns or mandates were needed, Reuters reports. He said it was possible that the new variant was already in the United States, although no official case has been confirmed.“The sequencing has confirmed the result - the suspected case which was made public yesterday morning is the Omicron variant,” Kai Klose, social affairs minister in the state of Hesse tweeted. On Saturday, he said a suspected Omicron case had been found in a passenger arriving from South Africa in Hesse, home to Frankfurt airport, one of Europe’s busiest air hubs. On Saturday, health officials in the southern state of Bavaria detected two cases of the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. Restrictions on air travel from South Africa took effect on Sunday after it was classified as a virus-variant area. This means airlines can fly only Germans to Germany from South Africa and even those who are vaccinated must spend 14 days in quarantine.Prof Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he expects to see “substantially larger numbers” of the Omicron variant in the coming days in the UK. He told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend programme: “We together with the Netherlands ... we’re the two European countries with the largest number of passenger flights to and from South Africa, so it’s likely we’ll detect quite a lot more cases in the coming days.” He said he backs the new measures announced by the government as “proportionate” to slow the spread of the new variant during the “waiting game” over the next two weeks as scientists analyse its properties.The judge was absent from the panel for musical week on 20 and 21 November, when he was replaced by Cynthia Erivo. Erivo was back on the panel again the following weekend, when she filled in for Motsi Mabuse, who was unable to travel back to the UK after close contact with someone with a positive test. Revel Horwood told Hello! magazine: “My work ethic is, unless you’re dead you go on stage and Dr Footlights takes care of the rest. “Even when I had my hip replaced, I was back at work on the Saturday. So I just hated it when they said I couldn’t go in.” The 61 people who tested positive for the virus on Friday after arriving on the last two flights to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport before a flight ban was put in place were immediately put into isolation while sequencing was carried out to establish if they had the new variant. The public health institute said in a statement that testing was continuing on the samples. Most of the 61 people who tested positive were put into isolation at a hotel near the airport, while a small number were allowed to sit out their quarantine at home under strict conditions. “The Omicron variant has so far been identified in 13 of the positive tests. The investigation has not yet been completed. The new variant may be found in more test samples,” the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said in a statement. Travel will remain free of the new restrictions in the common travel areas.  The British embassy in Dublin confirmed the development this morning.  The confirmation will be a relief to all the Irish families planning their first Christmas in Ireland in two or three years who may otherwise have reviewed or cancelled trips because of onerous cost of tests. Financial markets didn’t wait for the announcement from Downing Street. It is far too early to know how big a threat the new strain poses but investors assumed the worst as soon as the reports arrived from southern Africa. Share prices fell heavily, with airline stocks the hardest hit as travel bans were re-introduced. Toughening up restrictions in the west in response to Omicron is a classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, because for months the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been warning rich developed countries that an end to the pandemic requires poor people as well as rich to be vaccinated. When asked if those aged 18-39 should brace for an extension to the booster programme on Radio 4’s Broadcasting House, Professor Anthony Harnden said: “I think there’s a very good, strong argument for raising the antibody level in the whole of the community. “So, accelerating the booster programme, both by extending the age range and by reducing the interval between the second dose and the booster dose, will be an acceptable strategy.” When pushed on whether people aged 18 and over would be invited to get the booster sooner, he added: “Those adults 18 plus will have an offer of a booster earlier than we had previously envisaged.”Simon Coveney clarified that travellers from Ireland to the UK will not be affected by the measures against the new Covid-19 variant. On Saturday the Irish Department of Health announced its own measures to mitigate against Omicron, including mandatory home quarantine regardless of vaccine status. Returning Irish residents will be required to undergo strict home quarantine regardless of vaccinerecoverytest status, and undergo PCR testing during quarantine.Beginning a morning of media interviews after Boris Johnson announced rules to combat the variant, including compulsory masks on public transport and in shops, the health secretary called the plans “proportionate and balanced”. Dr Paul Burton said: “I think we have cause to be hopeful, we’ve learnt a lot about this virus in general. “You know, we’ve learned so much about how to deal with Covid as well, through simple measures, and obviously through vaccines, but until we see how this virus now behaves in populations of older people, people with other comorbidities. We really want to get a handle on exactly how severe the disease could be, I think.” He added: “This is a dangerous-looking virus, but I think we have many tools in our armamentarium now to get to fight it, so I’m optimistic.” Dr Burton said researchers will have a better idea about the effectiveness of the current vaccines against Omicron in the “next couple of weeks”, but if a new vaccine is required that could be produced on a large scale by early 2022.Sturgeon told the Andrew Marr programme on BBC1 that the variant, which was first detected in southern Africa, had not yet been found in Scotland. But she added: “I’m asking people to behave in Scotland just now as if it is present.” She said tougher restrictions, including on travel, could be needed if the variant caught hold. The Scottish government has already matched all the restrictions on travel from southern Africa introduced by the UK government for English airports last week. “I think we may need to go further to restrict travel in the next few days,” she said. “I think we need to be open minded to doing anything to keep the population safe right now.” She said that “on the upside”, health experts and ministers knew what to do in these situations, and the vaccines were still effective at limiting its spread and its ill-effects. She urged people to take up vaccines and booster jabs.Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the variant in a man in his early 30s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: “What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember I’m at the epicentre - that’s where I’m practising - it’s extremely mild. For us, that’s mild cases.” When asked if the UK was “panicking unnecessarily”, she said: “I think you already have it there in your country and you’re not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. “Two weeks from now maybe we will say something different.”Speaking to Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News, Lisa Nandy said her party will consider the plans in Parliament on Monday but there are “a number of outstanding holes in our defences” that need to be addressed. Asked if she accepts the Government’s strategy laid out on Saturday, she said: “There is a balance to be struck, I think the Health Secretary is right about that. “We don’t think the Government has been getting the balance right up to now. That’s why we support the measures to bring in greater use of masks, mandatory masks in some settings, and we’ll be asking questions about whether the scientific basis for that suggests that that needs to go further. “We desperately want to see them tighten up the travel restrictions. There is a real problem when for 18 months the Government has been warned that there are holes in those defences and still hasn’t taken action to plug what you rightly suggested are just practical measures that could be dealt with in order to stop the new variant spreading around the country.”Speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky, Sajid Javid said that following the news of a new variant: “I do think people will take this more seriously.” He added that people should make plans for Christmas “as normal” amid questions about another lockdown. Javid said: “I think it’s fair to say that the nature of this pandemic is it would be irresponsible to make guarantees. “As for Christmas, I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think it’s going to be a great Christmas.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"common travel area exempt from new uk travel restrictions as 3 735 new cases reported in state","story":"International passengers walk through the arrivals area at Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport. The UK and many other countries have introduced new travel restrictions in a bid to curb the spread of Omicron. Photograph: Getty  The exemption of the Common Travel Area (CTA) from new Covid-19 restrictions being implemented in the UK against the Omicron variant has been welcomed by Government.New tougher measures including PCR testing will be introduced for arrivals to the UK from Tuesday morning.All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status, amid concerns existing vaccines will be less effective against the strain, which is believed to spread rapidly.However, this will not apply to the Common Travel Area (CTA), which covers Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the Channel Islands and which allows effectively unrestricted travel. The news came as a further 3,735 cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the State on Sunday. As of 8am, 566 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, 117 of whom are in ICU. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney welcomed the move to exempt the CTA from the UK measures and said travellers from Ireland to the UK will not be affected by the measures against the new Covid-19 variant.No PCR test or quarantine will be required by a passenger arriving in the UK if they are travelling within the CTA and have not been outside the CTA in the previous 10 days.A number of countries have introducing travel bans and restrictions on passengers from southern African countries in a bid to contain the new variant. The Irish Government is to consider the steps taken by the UK and a senior source said all responses to the variant were now under review.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is “considering further required measures” as countries move to prevent the spread of Omicron. Early evidence suggests Omicron has an increased re-infection risk, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has designated the variant as being of concern.In a statement on Saturday evening, the Department of Health said the Nphet Epidemiological Team is meeting regularly this weekend to monitor the developing situation in Europe after several countries confirmed cases of the new variant, which has been deemed “of concern” by the World Health Organisation.Nphet on Saturday said it was aware of new cases of Omicron in the UK, Italy, Germany and Belgium even though it had not been formally notified by European Alert Systems as yet.“The Nphet Epidemiological Team are meeting regularly over the weekend to monitor the situation and are currently considering further required measures,” it said.It added that a series of initial measures have been put in place to mitigate against the arrival of this variant to Ireland. These include an emergency brake for travel to and from seven southern African countries deemed of concern in respect of the variant.People arriving here from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique will have to present “not-detected” pre-flight PCR result, regardless of vaccination status, and quarantine at home for 10 days, undergoing a further two PCR tests. The Department of Foreign Affairs has changed its travel advisory to “avoid non-essential travel” to these countries. “Regulations are being drawn up urgently to give effect to the new travel and home quarantine policies,” said the Nphet statement.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan on Sunday said the Omicron variant is “across Europe, it seems” and that its real impact would not be known for a number of weeks. “It will take 2-3 weeks to see, well, does it increase transmissibility, does it increase illness or can it get around vaccines,” he told RTÉ’s The Week in Politics programme. Mr Ryan said Ireland is doing “a lot of testing”, but that the Omicron variant had not yet been picked up. Mr Ryan said the move to ban flights from southern African countries in light of the new variant was the right one. The Minister said there was a need to “double down” on existing measures to tackle the Delta wave currently sweeping across the country and through the hospital system. He said the Government had been “pushing full tilt” to get vaccination numbers up.‘Change the game’Dr Cillian de Gascun, head of the National Virus Reference Laboratory and Nphet member, said the State needs to operate on the basis that the Omicron variant could “change the game”. Dr de Gascun on Sunday said the mutations the variant has are “concerning”. However, while he said that the variant appears to be more transmissible, it does not necessarily mean the vaccines will be ineffective against it. He said there has not been an examination of the severity of the virus yet, as there is typically a lag between infection and hospitalisation. Mr De Gascun said the variant is a “concern” among Irish health officials who are meeting over the weekend to discuss it.“We are still in the middle of a very significant Delta wave that we need to control first. We don’t know yet what Omicron does in a Delta wave,” he told Newstalk’s On the Record.He added that there was a need for society to think about the next three months, and not just Christmas. Separately, in comments to the Sunday Business Post newspaper, Dr de Gascun said that if Omicron is more transmissible than the Delta variant, then it is a “matter of time” before the new variant arrives in Ireland.Dr de Gascun told the Sunday Business Post there would be a ramping up of genome sequencing, and every positive Covid-19 sample since November 1st would be screened for Omicron. Speaking about the new variant, Dr de Gascun told the newspaper: “It is more different to the original Wuhan virus than any of the other variants. It is almost like something Dr Evil would construct on an island lair. If you were trying to put together lots of really bad mutations, this would be it.”Dr de Gascun said, in his view, hospital numbers would need to fall below 200, and ICU figures would need to drop beneath 100, if new Covid-19 restrictions were to be avoided in the coming weeks. To avoid further restrictions in the hospitality sector, he said, infections would soon have to fall dramatically. In the Republic, 4,791 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Saturday morning. At 8pm, 542 Covid-19 patients were in hospital with the virus the latest data on ICU figures, taken at 11.30am on Saturday, indicated there were 121 people in intensive care with the disease.Hospitalisations were down by 149 on the peak of the fourth wave, which occurred on November 22nd, when there were 685 people in hospital. The number of patients in ICU peaked on Wednesday at 132.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he “fully endorses” the recent recommendation by Nphet that indoor gatherings for children should be avoided for the next fortnight.Acknowledging that the measure would be challenging for children, Mr Martin told the Sunday Independent newspaper it would be reviewed over the next two weeks. “I anticipate this will be short-term,” he said. Mr Ryan on Sunday agreed with the Taoiseach that those measures involving children should be temporary. “That has to be temporary measures, we also have to be conscious of the need for our children to learn by play and through day-to-day contact,” he said. – Additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet meeting to monitor omicron variant and considering further measures","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.

That might include a decision to follow the UK’s lead requiring all incoming passengers to take a PCR test upon arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. However, that possibility has yet to be discussed by senior ministers and public health advisers.It is also understood that work is also being done this weekend on a new passenger locator form for people arriving into Irish territory. This will ensure that the original place of travel is included in the form. None of the seven countries in Southern Africa which originally notified cases of the new variant have direct flights into Ireland.It comes following the announcement that legislation is being prepared to reintroduce mandatory hotel quarantine. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Saturday it would be the first item on the agenda at the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.‘Emergency brake’On Friday, the Irish Government followed the European Union in agreeing to implement an “emergency brake” on arrivals from seven southern African countries.Mr Ryan also said the Department of Foreign Affairs was working with a “small number” of people in southern Africa who were trying to get back to Ireland following the travel restrictions.Mr Ryan said there were limited options available for people with the airlines and the department was looking at chartering a plane to repatriate these people.Mr Ryan said news of the Omicron variant was a shock and one of the most disheartening recent developments in the pandemic.“I’ll be honest, I was frightened yesterday. It was a blow. I was thinking if we get these boosters out in the next few weeks we’ll be in better shape, and we will.”He said it was not clear yet if this new variant was more transmissible or was able to bypass some of the protections offered by vaccines.Asked if the Cabinet would consider other restrictions in addition to mandatory quarantine, Mr Ryan said the truth was that a lot of what has been done will have to be continued.Under the restrictions announced on Friday, people arriving into Ireland from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique will have to present “not-detected” pre-flight PCR result, regardless of vaccination status, and quarantine at home for 10 days, undergoing a further two PCR tests.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane said it was accepted the Omicron variant was a real concern and there was a need to move fast.A spokesperson for the department said it was providing consular assistance to Irish citizens who had requested it.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Omicron variant, Green Party leader and Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said, is “across Europe, it seems”. Speaking to RTÉ’s The Week in Politics programme, he said Ireland is doing “a lot of testing” but has not picked up the new variant yet. “We won’t know the real impact of this for a number of weeks. It will take two- three weeks to see, well, does it increase transmissibility, does it increase illness or can it get around vaccines,” he said. In the meantime, Mr Ryan said there was a need to “double down” on existing measures to tackle the Delta wave currently sweeping across the country and through the hospital system. However, he added that “it does look like the vaccines will still give us protection and that’s a really important message”Pointing to measures introduced on Friday mandating those arriving from eight southern African countries, he said they were the “right measures, they were put in straightaway and now we work with our health authorities to see what additional measures might have to be done”“That hasn’t gone away, there’s still 5,000 people a day getting infected in our country so it shouldn’t distract us from the basic things we have been doing well to get the numbers down,” he said, adding that there were encouraging signs that the situation in hospitals is stabalising. He backed comments from the Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, who said that any lockdown of children’s’ activities should be temporary. The Nphet has advised curtailing such activities for a two- week period, which will be considered by cabinet on Tuesday. Mr Ryan said these measures had to be temporary. “We also have to be conscious of the need for our children to learn by play and through day-to-day contact. Their recommendation for that was for a very specific recent spike in the numbers in that age group”.He said the Government has been “pushing full tilt” to get vaccination numbers up.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillPolitical Correspondent Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said that emergence of new variants will mean that, for the foreseeable future, Irish people will have “to learn to live with Covid-19 pending a successful global eradication campaign”. In his keynote address to the party’s annual convention, Mr Ryan began by speaking of the new variant of concern that has emerged in southern Africa in recent days, saying it was a worrying development but that it would ultimately be addressed by vaccines.“I know the TV news bulletins might be alarming but please remember that there are several reasons to remain hopeful,” Mr Ryan, who is also Minister for Climate Change, Communications and Transport told delegates.“While the new variant may prove to be more contagious, our best scientists expect that the vaccines will still provide us with protection. What we need to do now is to accelerate the booster programme here at home, and ensure the whole world gets access to vaccines at urgent speed. The only way to stop this disease in its tracks is to have a co-ordinated global approach,” he said.He said the people would have to learn to live with Covid until the worldwide vaccination campaign had completed.However, he said that people would have to be allowed “to enjoy a normal social life because that too is vital for our health and wellbeing”.The party’s intention had been to hold this year’s convention in the Aviva Stadium but it migrated online once the Government’s advice changed earlier this month in the face of the deteriorating Covid-19 situation.Green policiesThe main theme of Mr Ryan’s speech, and also that of deputy leader Catherine Martin, was that the time for action on Green policies in Government is now. He said that not alone had Green policies been approved by the Government, but they were beginning to be implemented.“We are talking the talk but increasingly we are walking the walk,” he said. “There are challenges ahead, of course. Will there be missteps along the way? Absolutely.“But we will learn as we go and we will emerge as a cleaner, greener, happier Ireland. We can do this and we will. The time is now,” he said.In her speech, Ms Martin said the Greens in Government must move faster and be more courageous in their actions.“Institutions, by their nature, don’t change quickly, but the Green Party knows and recognises the urgency to change course.“The old system is built for the old world. It cannot be business as usual.“And if our institutions can’t get what needs to be done, then let’s never accept no for an answer,” said Ms Martin, who is also Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.She said that the world needed new visions, new leaders and change-makers.She said the Green Party needed to constantly push the boundaries and challenge the status quo.She also said people were demanding the Greens “must do better”.Mr Ryan and Ms Martin argued that the Green Party had achieved a lot in its first 18 months in Government in all of its key areas, including climate change, the environment, bioersity, the arts and tourism (including supports during Covid), children, housing and health.Now, I know there are some people at home who may not share the Green Party’s passion for climate action and who wonder whether it’s all worth it,” said Mr Ryan in his address.“For those listening at home, let me say that the risk isn’t from taking action – the real risk is from standing back and doing nothing at all.Transition“For this new green economy is the one that is emerging across the world. It is an inevitable transition because under business as usual, the world will simply burn…“It is a transition requiring such scale and speed that it needs every person and every place to be involved, which is one of the reasons we have to make sure it is a just transition.”In terms of action, Mr Ryan said a million euro would be spent on active travel every day. He said there would be proposals brought to the Government in the next few weeks to electrify the Maynooth rail line and to order 95 battery electric train carriages for Irish Rail. He said the Bus Connects and Dublin  projects will be brought to Cabinet in the first quarter of next year.He said that under new clean-air regulations there would be no further sales of inefficient solid home-heating fuels from next autumn and that auctions for offshore wind would begin about the same time.“This isn’t all just aspiration by the way, we are already doing this.“We are world leaders at integrating renewable electricity and are well placed to deliver the solar and wind power we have in abundance,” he said.

Photograph: William WestAFP via Getty ImagesThe new Omicron coronavirus variant kept spreading around the world on Sunday, with 13 cases found in the Netherlands and two in Australia, even as more countries tried to seal themselves off by imposing travel restrictions.Dutch health authorities announced that the 13 cases of the variant were found among passengers who were on flights from South Africa that arrived in Amsterdam on Friday.More than 60 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa had tested positive for Covid-19.The discovery of Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” last week by the World Health Organization, has sparked worries around the world that it could resist vaccinations and prolong the nearly two-year Covid-19 pandemic.First discovered in South Africa, the variant has since been detected in Britain, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong. Health officials in Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, said two passengers who arrived in Sydney from southern Africa on Saturday evening had tested positive for the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.Both people were asymptomatic, fully vaccinated and in quarantine, NSW Health said. Another 12 passengers from southern Africa were also in 14 days of hotel quarantine, while around 260 other passengers and aircrew have been directed to isolate.Austria was investigating a suspected case on Sunday and in France Health Minister Olivier Veran said the new variant was probably already circulating there.Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe Covid-19 compared to other strains.Countries have imposed a wave of travel bans or curbs on southern Africa. Financial markets ed on Friday as investors worried that the variant could stall a global recovery. Oil prices tumbled by about $10 a barrel.On Sunday, most Gulf stock markets fell sharply in early trade, with the Saudi index suffering its biggest single-day fall in nearly two years.In the most far-reaching effort to keep the variant at bay, Israel announced late on Saturday it would ban the entry of all foreigners and reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant.Prime minister Naftali Bennett said the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days. Officials hope that within that period there will be more information on how effective vaccines are against Omicron.Many countries have imposed or are planning restrictions on travel from southern Africa. The South African government denounced this on Saturday as unfair and potentially harmful to its economy - saying it is being punished for its scientific ability to identify coronavirus variants early.In Britain, where two linked cases of Omicron identified on Saturday were connected to travel to southern Africa, the government announced measures to try to contain the spread, including stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country and requiring mask wearing in some settings.British health minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday he expected to receive advice imminently on whether the government can broaden a programme of providing booster shots to fully vaccinated people, to try to weaken the impact of the variant.The German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant on Saturday. In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique.Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese respiratory disease expert, said it could take some time to reach a conclusion on the harmfulness of the new variant, state television reported on Sunday.Although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating, many countries - including the United States, Brazil, Canada, European Union nations, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand - have announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa.More countries imposed such curbs on Sunday, including Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.Mexico’s deputy health secretary, Hugo Lopez Gatell, said travel restrictions are of little use in response to the new variant, calling measures taken by some countries “disproportionate”.“It has not been shown to be more virulent or to evade the immune response induced by vaccines. They affect the economy and well-being of people,” he said in a Twitter post on Saturday.Omicron has emerged as many countries in Europe are already battling a surge in Covid-19 infections, with some reintroducing restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread.The new variant has also thrown a spotlight on huge disparities in vaccination rates around the globe. Even as many developed countries are giving third-dose boosters, less than 7 per cent of people in low-income countries have received their first Covid-19 shot, according to medical and human rights groups. - Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"pcr tests required for passengers arriving into uk after omicron variant detected","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.  Video: 10 Downing StreetBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson warned the new variant could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Photograph: Hollie AdamsPoolAFPGettyBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus including mandatory masks in shops and PCR tests for travellers entering the UK after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.Amid mounting global concern over Omicron, named a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation on Friday, the prime minister set out a series of steps the UK is taking to maximise its defence against Covid-19.The Irish Government is to review the steps taken by the UK government against the new Covid-19 Omicron variant, which requires all travellers entering the State take a PCR test by the second day of arrival. A source said that advice was not to follow the UK lead for the moment but to await the outcome of a series of high-level discussions over the next few days on the best approach.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said anyone arriving in the UK will be asked to take a PCR test for Covid-19 on the second day and must self-isolate until they provide a negative test.The rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will also be tightened, he said.Contacts of all confirmed cases of people infected with the Omicron variant will have to self-isolate for 10 days. Health officials are also examining the case for widening access to the booster vaccine programme, he added. The measures will be reviewed in three weeks.Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more severe illness. Mr Johnson warned it could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, as he announced a strengthening of England’s rules after two cases were identified in Nottingham and Brentwood in Essex.Booster campaignIn an effort to slow the spread, Mr Johnson announced “temporary and precautionary” measures to be reviewed in three weeks, alongside an expansion of the vaccine booster campaign.Mr Johnson said he remained confident that this Christmas “will be considerably better than last Christmas”. Asked about the prospect for this year’s festivities, the prime minister said: “We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout and I think I’m going to stick with the formula I’ve used before, which is I’m pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas.”The measures announced fall short of the government’s plan B, which involves advice to work from home and the use of vaccine passports. However, the UK may need to “face up” to the possibility of further action if the Omicron variant is very transmissible, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said.He said: “I think we’ll get more information on transmissibility, we’ll get more information on the ability of the vaccines to protect against the virus, but that’s going to take a little bit of time.“At the moment, the models are more ‘if it spreads very fast, of course it’s going to spread very fast and go into a lot of places, and if it spreads less fast it’s going to do so less’.“But if it’s very transmissible and does cause a big escape, then clearly that’s a major issue we have to face up to. But that isn’t what we know at the moment, we need to get that information.”Prof Chris Whitty told the press conference it was “inevitable” the Omicron variant will spread across the world over the next few days. England’s chief medical officer said that while it is clear Omicron is highly transmissible, it is not yet known how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it – but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill.Red listEarlier on Saturday Sajid Javid, the health secretary, announced that the UK was adding four more southern African nations to the travel red list after two cases of the new variant were detected in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex.The UK Health Security Agency confirmed the cases, which are believed to be connected and linked to travel from southern Africa, after genomic sequencing overnight. The iniduals and their households were ordered into self-isolation and targeted testing was being carried out in areas where they are thought to have been infectious.Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday. Javid said “this is a real reminder that this pandemic is far from over” as he urged people to get their vaccines, including boosters.“We were concerned from the moment we first identified this new variant,” he added. He said anyone who has travelled in the last 10 days to the countries now on the red list, which also includes South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia, must self-isolate and take PCR tests.The UK is the second European nation to have reported the presence of Omicron after Belgium said it had identified a single case on Friday. In the Netherlands authorities said 61 people tested positive for Covid-19 arriving on two flights from South Africa on Friday. Further tests are under way to determine if any of them had the Omicron variant.It was unclear when the two iniduals in the UK were infected, or their full travel history, as countries scrambled to close their borders to much of southern Africa. Ministers said non-UK and non-Irish residents who have been in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola in the previous 10 days will be refused entry into England from 4am on Sunday. Those who are permitted to return will be ordered to isolate in a government-approved facility for 10 days.Risk of reinfectionNumerous pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron after the WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the variant has an increased risk of reinfection and may spread more rapidly than other strains.Commenting on two cases of the Omicron Covid variant being detected in the UK, Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine, Imperial College London, said: “There is no need to get alarmed, but we do need to be prepared and to take rapid action.“It is better to act fast but be prepared to change as new information comes in. Travel restrictions may slow the rate of growth and buy time to establish the important facts about severity, immune evasion, transmission and susceptibility to treatment and prevention.”Openshaw added: “With or without this new variant, Delta is already a crisis in many parts of Europe and still causing a lot of illness and death in the UK, especially in those not vaccinated or in those who do not respond to vaccines.” – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"appeasing putin wont work germany needs strong western alliances","story":"If Vladimir Putin intends to destroy Ukraine, Olaf Scholz is the only person in Europe who could stop him without firing a shot. Both know that Russia and Germany need one another. But the new German Chancellor is a man of the Left who wants peace in our time – even at the price of appeasement. That enables Putin to blackmail him. Could Scholz be the German Neville Chamberlain?Such a fate is not inevitable. The new German leader says he wants to reach out to Russia with a new Ostpolitik – the Cold-War-era policy of reconciliation with the Eastern bloc pursued by his great Social Democratic predecessor, Willy Brandt, in the 1970s. Right now, though, Putin does not seem disposed to grasp the proffered hand. The Russian Army has up to 100,000 heavily armed troops on the Ukrainian border, pointing a pistol at its neighbour’s head. Germany is handicapped by the fact that its own forces have probably never been weaker – and the fragile coalition that Scholz leads has no inclination to increase defence spending. As by far the biggest economy in the EU and Russia’s second largest trading partner, Germany should be playing the role of protector towards the smaller nations of Eastern Europe. Instead, under Angela Merkel, the Russians and their allies have been allowed to bully their neighbours, especially Ukraine. Scholz has said that the Russian annexation of Crimea and other unilateral changes to European borders are unacceptable. But the question is: what can he actually do about it?In the years since Putin parked his tanks on Ukraine’s lawn in 2014, the EU has imposed sanctions and German exports to Russia have halved. But the two countries have also built the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine and now awaits regulatory approval in Berlin and Brussels. If the underwater gas supply goes ahead, it will not only reduce Kyiv’s political leverage but also increase Europe’s – and especially Germany’s – dependence on Russian energy.Scholz has yet to show his hand on Nord Stream 2. But Putin’s show of strength has an ulterior motive. It puts pressure on the Germans to give the go-ahead to a lucrative piece of infrastructure that the Kremlin sees as a diplomatic master stroke. Ever since Germany’s last Social Democratic Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, left office in 2005, he has been the front-man for Gazprom’s project – and pushing at an open door. German business and consumers demand cleaner, more secure energy. The Greens, now part of the coalition, want coal to be phased out by 2030 in order to reach net zero. Why wouldn’t Scholz sign off a deal that would guarantee gas supplies for the foreseeable future?Has the new German Chancellor yet grasped the implications of Putin’s strategy? Not only is the Russian leader on a mission to rebuild his country’s empire, but he hopes to undermine Nato and ide the EU in the process. Scholz sees Emmanuel Macron as a friend, Joe Biden only as a “partner”, and Boris Johnson merely as a nuisance. Yet in six months Macron may be gone, replaced by a pro-Putin populist such as Éric Zemmour. Meanwhile the Americans and the British are, as in the Cold War, the only reliable allies for those menaced by Russian power and influence. The Poles and Balts know this – which is why Royal Engineers are even now helping to secure Poland’s border with Belarus. As for Ukraine’s President Zelensky: he fears not only a Russian invasion or coup, but also betrayal by Scholz and Macron, just as pre-war Czechoslovakia was betrayed at Munich by Chamberlain and Daladier. The single most important move that Scholz could make when he takes office next week would be to invite Zelensky to Berlin. He has already promised to go to Paris – but he should add Washington and London to his itinerary. Russia and Germany have always had a love-hate relationship, at times culturally creative, at others violently destructive –  a past that still overshadows the present. When the Berlin Wall fell, half a million Russians were still living in East Germany one of them was Vladimir Putin. He is still seeking revenge for that moment of humiliation, if necessary by force. Scholz sees himself as a peacemaker. But he does not speak Putin’s language in any sense – unlike Angela Merkel, who knows from experience how dangerous he can be. When asked by a teenage scribbler whether Putin was a murderer, Scholz dodged the question. The tranquillity of Europe now depends on whether the technocrat in Berlin can outwit the autocrat in Moscow. Daniel Johnson is editor of TheArticleMore from NewsCold Moon 2021: what time it peaks in the UK and full moon dates for next yearGeminid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?With Kamala Harris looking unelectable, the Democrats are considering the nuclear optionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new face mask rules coverings mandatory","story":"Mandatory mask-wearing will return to shops and public transport in England this week, as the Government takes action to try to tackle the omicron coronavirus variant that has arrived in the UK. The rules surrounding face masks were relaxed in England in July. The change was announced by Boris Johnson at a Downing Street press conference on Saturday, Nov 27, after omicron cases were confirmed in Nottinghamshire and Brentwood, Essex.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, gave more detail on Sunday, Nov 28, when he said the masks rule would apply from Tuesday and would bring England closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Prime Minister said on Nov 27 that hospitality would be exempt from the rule change, and further details would be outlined by the Health Secretary in the course of the next day or so.The official government web page for masks had not been updated by Nov 27 to take account of the latest change, but it states the following groups are exempt from wearing a mask: Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: We support the wearing of masks but there are major issues about enforcement and it is our members left in the front line with angry passengers who refuse to comply. The Government must make the resources available to police this reintroduction of masks.Bobby Morton, the Unite national officer for passenger transport, said: It is not sufficient to announce that face masks will once again become compulsory, this policy has got to be fully enforced in order to protect public health.The Government\u0027s previous inconsistent messaging on face mask wearing is almost certainly going to result in a high degree of non-compliance.Unite\u0027s advice to bus drivers is clear: it is not their role to enforce mask wearing, their responsibility is to safely drive and operate the bus. The job of enforcing mask wearing is that of the bus operator and the police.Unite has consistently warned that the requirement to wear face masks should never have been removed while rates of Covid-19 remained high. It is only the arrival of the new variant which has forced the Government to act.James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: We are helping retailers to prepare for the change in face covering rules, but they are extremely concerned about abuse against their staff from customers who don\u0027t want to wear a face covering in a shop.We will continue to urge stores to communicate the rules, but not to challenge those who refuse to abide by the rules.Passengers arriving to the UK have been told that from Tuesday, Nov 30, they will have to take a PCR test for Covid-19, with the expectation they will have to self-isolate until they test negative.All contacts of a suspected case of omicron will have to isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. To further slow the arrival of cases, ministers said Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola would face travel restrictions from Nov 28, when they will join South Africa and five other neighbouring nations on UK red lists.Speaking on Nov 28, Mr Javid said it was nowhere near the time to reintroduce social distancing rules and work-from-home guidance, and was hopeful the mask mandate would be removed within weeks.He said it would be irresponsible to make guarantees during the ever-changing pandemic, but told Sky\u0027s Trevor Phillips on Sunday: I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think it\u0027s going to be a great Christmas.Mr Johnson said the measures would be reviewed in three weeks - just days before Christmas - as he warned omicron appears to spread very rapidly, can transmit between the double-vaccinated, and may partially reduce the protection offered by existing vaccines.The UK, Germany and Italy all confirmed the presence of Omicron on Nov 27, a day after the variant - which was first detected in South Africa - was reported to be in Belgium.More from NewsCold Moon 2021: what time it peaks in the UK and full moon dates for next yearGeminid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?With Kamala Harris looking unelectable, the Democrats are considering the nuclear optionWhy the omicron Covid variant is the most concerning so farMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would bet boris saving christmas last years fiasco","story":"Those who are well-practised at letting people down while evading ferocious blame tend to be good at choosing their moments.Boris Johnson seems to have pinpointed late afternoon on a Saturday as the optimum time to break bad news. One recalls his fraught unveiling of the second lockdown at the end of October last year as such an event. Perhaps there is something about this mid-point of a weekend which catches us at our most forgiving and phlegmatic.The new restrictions the PM announced yesterday initially struck me as irritating but tolerable and not as bad as expected: back to compulsory masks in shops and on public transport but not in hospitality settings tougher quarantine and testing requirements for international travellers and their contacts a ramping up of the vaccine booster programme.In the cold light of day, I’m not so sure. For our old foes the slippery slope and the boiled lobster are back on the scene. The first of these is the focus for the hyper-vigilant among us who will suspect that once the mindset of social control has been re-established among the powers-that-be, it will inevitably lead to a descent into ever more draconian measures. The latter is what happens to the less observant – a gradual turning up of the temperature that is barely perceptible at any given moment but ends with us noticing too late that our civil liberties have been boiled alive.So perhaps we are better to cry foul and pledge resistance now rather than brace for the restoration of the rule of six in hospitality, then an instruction to work from home if we can, followed by limits on household mixing that could nix Christmas and finally the whole hog of another lockdown.After all, one consequence of Mr Johnson’s announcements yesterday is the likely return of the “pingdemic” that wrecked so many plans in the spring and early summer. Being a contact of someone with the omicron variant will result in 10 precautionary days in the cooler. Another consequence is that short overseas breaks will once again become more trouble than they are worth, with isolating on arrival home a requirement until a negative PCR test result is obtained.Yet another consequence will be the puncturing of a gradually emerging consensus among the populace that the worst is behind us and we can approach the future with a more positive attitude. If Franklin D Roosevelt’s famous observation that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” can properly be applied to current circumstances then Johnson has goofed by throwing the vehicle into reverse.As Matt Ridley points out in the  today, lockdown measures come with a “severe psychological, economic and human cost” that is seldom accorded due weight by policymakers.Yesterday’s Downing Street briefing included a review of the current Covid data by chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty, giving him a chance to reprise his famous catchphrase “next slide please”. And this time round the slides told a positive story of falling hospitalisations and deaths even amid stubbornly high level of cases being detected. Basically, we’d cracked it.Only now the story being pumped out on broadcast media is that omicron means we could be in big trouble again after all. Whitty’s fellow boffin, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, referred in passing at the briefing to the much better treatments that exist for Covid now, compared to a year ago.Today’s  has further positive news on that score, with dramatic positive results from early trials of the “SpiDex” drug combination treatment and an equally exciting cell therapy being pioneered in Israel that seems to be bringing very sick people back from the brink of death.Instead of contemplating this and taking further steps to restoring our collective sense of self-confidence, we have in effect been nudged back into our shells, just in case omicron proves so infectious and severe that it would send a huge surge of people into hospitals if we lived normally. That’s not what South African GP Dr Angelique Coetzee, the doctor who first spotted omicron, expects. She says the symptoms in patients she treated tended to be “mild” compared to those associated with previous strains of Covid.We should all know a lot more in three weeks, when the current measures are reviewed in the light of what we have found out about omicron and any other relevant developments in the interim.

Those who are identied as being at risk will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government said.The Prime Minister said: This is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new iant and maximises our defences. A tweet from the PMaposs office said: COVID UPDATE: All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace.  Earlier today officials confirmed the first to Omicron cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham, forcing the PM to act. In a press conference from Downing Street, he also announced that all arrivals to the UK will face mandatory PCR tests. The Prime Minister added border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said.  While the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron is currently unclear, Mr Johnson said there are good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. He said weaposre going to boost the booster campaign by asking the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationto consider giving boosters to as wide a group as possible as well as reducing the gap between second doses and the booster. Professor Chris Whitty said it is inevitable the Omicron iant will spread across the world over the next few days. Englandaposs chief medical officer said while it is clear Omicron is highly transmissible, it is not yet clear how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it - but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccine makers are already looking at how they can make them more effective against emerging iants, and that a jab designed to specically target the Omicron iant could be created in about  days.  He told the Downing Street press conference: I think itaposs important to recognise there are three ways in which this can be done and the companies are thinking about this. The first is the boosters will give high enough antibody coverage that actually thataposs going to be enough to cover this. Thataposs the first situation and needs to be tested. But that looks like something that anyway is going to give protection, whether thereaposs more needed on top of that weaposll have to see. The second is that vaccine manufacturers have been producing broader vaccines anyway to get broader coverage across potential new iants. So those are in the pipeline. Then a couple of companies have already said they could tweak their existing vaccines and get a new vaccine out specically against this in about  days. Those are the sort of three scenarios, clearly the one which is the one to really go for now is boost, because it is the case that as you keep boosting the vaccine, you get slightly broader coverage because the immune system knows it needs to get broader. Because the antibody levels are so high, it actually causes enough coverage of other iants to be effective. He added it is expected the iant will spread.

Boris Johnson announced theof mandatory face masks in shops and public transport, tighter restrictions on arrivals in the UK and  day self-isolation for anyone who has been in contact with a suspected Omicron case.But Sir Patrick warned that might not be enough to tackle the new iant, first identied in southern Africa this week,it is very transmissible. He told the Downing Street press conference: I think weaposll get more information on transmissibility, weaposll get more information on the ability of the vaccines to protect against the virus, but thataposs going to take a little bit of time. At the moment, the models are more apos it spreads very fast, of course itaposs going to spread very fast and go into a lot of places, andit spreads less fast itaposs going to do so lessapos. Butitaposs very transmissible and does cause big escape, then clearly thataposs a major issue we have to face up to. But that isnapost what we know at the moment, we need to get that information.  The PM warned the new iant, seen for the first time on Tuesday in southern Africa, spreads more easily, and could be more resistant to vaccinations - even spreading betwen two double vaccinated people. The Prime Minister opened a Number  press conference by saying: Apologies for disturbing your Saturday.He said face covering rules in shops and on public transport would be tightened up. He later claried this would mean you have to wear them in retail settings or on public transport, but that Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, would give more detail in the course of the next day or so. The official Number  Twitter account then claried this would not include hospitality settings like pubs and restaurants.And people who have been in contact with people suspected of having the Omicron iant will have to self-isolate for ten days, regardless of their vaccine status. He also announced all arrivals in the UK would have to take a PCR test by day two after entering the country, and isolate until their results are in. Weaposre not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, weaposre not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result, he said.  Second, we need to slow down the spread of this iant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together. We will require all contacts of those who test positive with a suspected case of Omicron to self-isolate for  days regardless of your vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport. And he said the government would boost the booster campaign, in a bid to fight the iant. He said: We donapost yet exactly know how effective our vaccines will be against Omicron but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. If youaposre boosted, your response is likely to be stronger so itaposs more vital than ever that people get their jabs and we get those boosters into arms as fast as possible. The PM said all the new measures would be temporary and reviewed in three weeks.

Mr Javid said masks would become mandatory in shops and on public transport from Tuesday in England, with all international arrivals told to take PCR tests and isolate until they receive the result. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days - eventhey are double jabbed - as there are fears the new strain may be able to evade existing vaccines. Mr Javid said the Government hoped these changes would be temporary and said people should plan for Christmas as normal.  He told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips on Sunday: I think itaposs fair to say that the nature of this pandemic is it would be irresponsible to make guarantees. As for Christmas, I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think itaposs going to be a great Christmas. Askedthe Government would introduce working from home or social distancing measures, he said: We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health. So,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and weaposre not there yet, weaposre nowhere near that. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been asked to look at extending the booster programme to under-s, with advice expected within the next few days. Boris Johnson set out the changes at a hastily-arranged Downing Street press conference on Saturday but he was criticised for being too vague on the details.The PM has resisted imposing plan B of the Governmentaposs Covid winter plan, which also includes ordering people to work from homepossible and vaccine passports.  The new restrictions are due to be laid before Parliament on Monday, with a vote for MPs within  days.Lockdown-sceptic Tories may stage a rebellion but it is unlikely to success as Labour usually supports the Government on Covid restrictions. However Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the party wants the Government to tighten up travel restrictions. She said questions remain around the scientic advice provided on mask wearing, the very little action on ventilation in public buildings and questions on travel restrictions. Ms Nandy said: The Government is saying everyone has to have a PCR test on day two when they arrive back in the UK, but theyaposre not suggesting pre-departure tests for people before they board flights. Thereaposs no advice for people about travelling back from the airport on public transport and there are very few checks on the PCR tests that are done. So, these are all things that for months the Government has been warned about. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache but none of the usual Covid symptoms. She told the BBC: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.

Heads were told to make sure they have enough supplies so all pupils can be given a lateral flow test when theyto the classroom in January. In an email to schools on Friday, the Department for Educationsaid it would help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the festive period.But union leaders accused the Government of treating heads like an ad hoc branch of the NHS .It comes as Britain braces to see the impact of a worrying new Covid iant first detected in South Africa, which has now been found in the UK. Two cases of the Omicron iant have been identied in Essex and Nottingham, prompting Boris Johnson to front a hastily-arranged press conference on Saturday announce new measures to halt its spread.Face coverings will be mandatory in shops and on public transport again from Tuesday, while all international arrivals will soon be required to take a more costly PCR test and isolate at home until they get their result. All contacts of an Omicron case will have to isolate at home for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. Around , pupilsin state schools were out of class due to Covid on November , down from ,on October , according to the DfE. But some schools have been forced to shut temporarily or send children home due to absence rates among staff and pupils. The Government guidance says schools should only send large numbers of children home in extreme cases and only as a last resort. On Friday, the DfE emailed school leaders to advise them to prepare for mass testing after Christmas. The email said: We would like all secondary schools to prepare to test their pupils once on-site onin January. We understand that this is a signicant additional ask but testing continues to play a vital role in keeping Covid- out of schools. Secondary schools have also been asked to order home testing kits so pupils can continue to test.  The email said: Testing all pupils in school boosts testing participation and will help reduce transmission after a period of social mixing over the school holidays. Tests, PPE and funding to support your workforce will be provided as before. After this test on , pupils should continue to test in line with Government guidelines. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders , said: We recognise the importance of Covid testing to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, but it is not reasonable for the Government to once again impose this considerable public health task on schools with minimal support. The role of schools should be limited to providing a space for test centres and communicating with students. But the Government expects them also to handle the logistics of staffing and setting up testing stations. It seems to have forgotten that school leaders are educators rather than an ad hoc branch of the NHS. Their focus is on providing the teaching and learning required by their students, which is particularly important in the context of the disruption caused by the pandemic. The last thing they need is another huge responsibility which does not even fall within the remit of education. At the start of the autumn term, all secondary school and college pupils in England were invited to take two lateral flow tests at school on their . Pupils were then asked to continue to test twice weekly at home. A DfE spokesperson said: As part of our commitment to protecting face-to-face education, we are asking all secondary school pupils to complete one on-site test as theyto school after the Christmas break, reflecting that mixing between households is likely to increase over Christmas. Protective measures in place continue to strike a balance between managing transmission risk with testing, hygiene, ventilation and vaccines, and we encourage any eligible young people who havenapost yet had the vaccine to consider using the Christmas break to do so.

However, did you know itaposs not only a literary triumph but a mathematical one too The is according to a YouTuber known as Tibees. In their video, we learn that author Lewis Caroll is actually a pen name for the th century mathematician Charles Dodgson.Originally, Dodgson told the story of Alice in Wonderland to Alice, the daughter of his university college dean. His mathematical work was barely noticed despite writing a couple of books on the subject, and he was much more well known as a fiction writer. Although, Dodgson still found a way to sneak some mathematics into the story, which may not be as easy to notice. In the video, Tibees takes us through the book and points out the exact moment that Alice falls into the rabbit hole. In the book, Alice says: “I’ll tryI know all the things I used to know. Let me see:  times  is  and  times  is . “And  times  is - oh dear! I shall never get to  at that rate!” According to Martin Gardner, a mathematics and science writer who published annotations for the story, there’s a system to Alice’s sums. In short, Alice is adding one every time she does a multiplication by four, andyou keep going this way, you’ll get to  x  which equals . Tibees adds: “Children especially only know their multiplications up to , so she won’t be able to go any further and won’t be able to get to . “This is a nonsense form of multiplication but it sets us up for the nonsense to come.” Next, it’s time to meet Cheshire the cat, a recognisable part of the story that we all know and love. There even seems to be some hidden maths in Cheshire’s famous grin, as Tibees explains in the video. She said: “The grin might be referring to abstract or pure mathematics. It doesn’t necessarily have a cat to go along with it.  “They’re doing it just for the joy of mathematics itself and are living in the abstract world of equations.” Another example is when Alice meets Mock the turtle, who may be introducing the idea of negative numbers when speaking to Alice. They discuss the idea of ‘lessons’, and how they last ten hours on the first day and lessen each day. Alice then asks what happens on the twelfth day, to which Mock quickly changes the subject. Tibees explains: “This is something that also puzzled early mathematicians. In this case, what would happen on the twelfth day. “Would students start to teach the teacher ” Next, the famous mad hatter tea party has three characters present, but the fourth character ‘time’ isn’t present. She explains further: “As a result, the party is forever stuck at tea time going round and round the table. “Now it might be nothing, but the idea of three characters stuck going around and around and not making much sense without time has the same idea of quaternions.” In fairly simple terms, a quaternion is an alternate way to describe orientation or rotations in D space using an ordered set of four numbers The concept was introduced not too long before the story was written, in the video we learn that they consist of ‘three spatial dimensions.’ I, J and K are the imaginary dimensions and the fourth dimension is real, that is time. Tibees explained: “Perhaps at the tea party, the guests were I, J and K, and without time, they don’t really make sense.” There are plenty of other complex examples within the video which hint at hidden maths planted by Lewis Caroll himself. It’s pretty impressive that he manages to write a classic book and incorporate some complicated mathematics in there too. She concludes: “Given the authoraposs background, it does make sense for there to be a little bit of mathematics. “But maybe the nature of this story just lends itself to these interpretations.” It seems like YouTube users were convinced with the analysis, as one commented: “ When Alice just falls down the rabbit hole and drinks from the bottle that shrinks her. She wonderssheaposll just keep getting smaller or go out entirely. “This seems like a reference to limits in calculus.” Another added: “I never realised this! Such a unique way to explain maths to children.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Lewis CarrollYouTubeMaths-Whizz\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jessica has since had five operations, three types of chemotherapy and spent y spells in hospital. Doctors decided she was too weak for any more surgery or chemotherapy and she was sent home from hospital in an ambulance for palliative care. The family of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, were then told she may only have weeks to live.  Mum Gillian Allum, , and dad Andrew Gibson, , first became concerned when their daughteraposs right eye began moving rapidly from side to side. But initial GP referral to the hospital led to a three or four-month wait for an MRI scan followed by a drop in Jessicaaposs weight and an admission to Wishaw General Hospital in Lanarkshire on July . After an emergency MRI scan at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, her parents were told there was a large mass in Jessica’s brain and smaller tumours in her spine. She endured three major operations in a week and also began chemotherapy. Andrew, who is an operations manager, said Jessica would be dead nowthey had waited four months for an MRI scan.He wants the NHS prioritise children showing signs of brain tumours. He told the Daily Record : “The MRI scans really need to take place within days rather than months.”Gillian, a business development manager, added: “We need to do more for children who present symptoms like Jessica’s and get their treatment fast-tracked. If the worst-case scenario happens to our daughter, I want to make sure no other family go through this.”  The couple are doing everything they can to get her better, including the use of approved herbal remedies and treatments. They are also speaking with a private consultant in Thailand who specialises in natural medicine.A JustGiving site has been set up to raise £, to support the family and pay for any possible future private procedures.One possibility is cell therapy treatment in a private London clinic, which could cost between £, and £,.

Parents hit out at Tony and Beverley Flackett, who run the popular Harleyaposs Cafe and Coffee Bar, in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, for implementing the policy.The venue reopened last month after having a £, extension and refurbishment and is now home to a host of new music, film and sport memorabilia on the walls and ceilings, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.It sells toasties, paninis, wraps, sandwiches, jacket potatoes and omelettes and many proclaim its breakfasts are the best in Hanley.

Tony told Stoke-on-Trent Live : We have had a no under-fives policy for  years simply because they run around, the mess they make and we donapost have the facilities in the toilets.We have signs outside on the board and on the door. I think weaposre the only place that doesnapost let under-fives in and people say they like coming here as there are no screaming kids.

We donapost have the space for pushchairs all over the place, weaposre not exactly a massive cafe. There are plenty of other cafes that let kids in, itaposs not like they havenapost got anywhere to go.  We had a couple of kids in this morning, they sat down and were well behaved, but children at two or three start running around and screaming. We have a lot of valuable stuff in here and we donapost want them to start messing around with them.

Unfortunately no under-fives are allowed. Iaposd say itaposs more for the kids not to touch all their items on the walls. Nothing to do with the pram space. I think itaposs so wrong, so Iaposve not been in since as my daughter is now  months. I think itaposs more kids touching and other customers moaning about screaming babies.

The TV environmentalist sent a moving letter to sick William Verden, , who is in a right-to-le struggle between doctors and his parents.Chris urged William’s mum Amy to “be strong and fight long and hard.” She said the family were “totally blown away” by his backing.Medics think William should no longer have le-saving treatment as his kidneys are “devastated” and a transplant is unlikely to work. His parents oppose condemning him to end-of-le care and are ready to fight Manchester Children’s Hospital decision.  Autistic William is kept alive by gruelling daily dialysis sessions and now has toy tiger Richard. Amy, , said: “The tiger, his adopted brother, is also in end-stage renal failure. When William needs dressing changes, so does Richard.” Amy, of Newton, Lancs, thinks palliative care is not the only option, as William, who has focal ­segmental glomerulosclerosis, is well enough to play golf twice a week. She believes his ­autism is behind the decision, however Manchester University NHS Trust strongly denies this claim. Relatives are raising funds to buy William an iPad and treats.

And like you there are some things that I find really hard to deal with. I have to try really hard to make them acceptable, I think about them in advance and imagine all the things that might happen. I run through all the things that might happen over and over again.  Then when it actually comes to dealing with those things I find I am much better prepared, its almost like they have actually already happened, so it doesn’t matter as much when they do. Maybe you could try this with your medical treatments, get yourself prepared in advance. William, everyone is trying to help you. They really, really love you and want you to be well. When you are calm and everything is cool try to think about this and make plans to help them help you. And then try to stick to those plans – even when everything gets hectic. It’s very hard, but I really hope you can try. Imagine everything like that is a hole in one! Now that would be something.

Face masks will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport from Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this morning.He added that he hopes the tougher rules on face coverings in England would be temporary as ministers reimpose some measures amid fears the new strain could evade existing vaccines. Boosters will be extended to younger age groups and the time between second and third jabs cut under recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation due later this week. But what is the Omicron iant  Why is it worse and how worried should we be  For answers to all those questions and more, read on...What is Omicron Omicron is the name given to the Covid iant B.... It was named by the World Health Organisation, which assigns iants of concern a Greek letter.Where did it come from It was first identied in Botswana on November  and linked to a surge in case numbers in the Gauteng province of South Africa.Why is it potentially more dangerous Omicron has  mutations on its spike protein – which allows the virus to unlock our body’s cells. It is more than double the number carried by the dominant Delta iant.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterHow worried should we be Scientists believe the iant is highly likely to be more transmissible and has features capable of evading the vaccine antibodies. But whether catching it would lead to more severe illness will not be known for weeks. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.What is the Government doing to stop the spread Ato mask-wearing in shops and on public transport. Airport arrivals must have a PCR test and self-isolate until they are confirmed to be virus-free. Close contacts of Omicron patients must also self-isolate, and there are plans to expand the booster jab programme. When can I get my booster Over-s, health and social workers, and those with underlying health conditions are already entitled to a third jab. Rolling out the programme to under-s requires the sign-off from the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations.Can the existing vaccines be tweaked Moderna and Novavax were already beginning work to tweak their vaccines, while Pfizer and BioNTech said that – in the event of a iant arriving which evades existing jabs – they expect to be able to “develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval”.Which countries are now on the red list Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola join South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

But after collapsing at home with Covid, James Grayson, , is in a coma and fighting for le. Eldest daughter Ebonnie, , said: “We are all broken beyond words. “He was really healthy, he would go to the gym all the time.

It’s heartbreaking to see him like that. “He’s not showing any signs of improvement.

The device temporarily takes over the work of the heart and lungs, pumping blood from the body to an articial lung that adds oxygen to it and removes carbon dioxide. Becky, who got together with James  years ago before they married in , added: “We are in absolute hell. “When I manage to get some sleep I keep dreaming that Jim is home and well. Then I wake and it’s like a smack in the face as reality hits me. “All of the children are devastated and missing their dad terribly.

The family have launched a GoFundMe appeal. Ebonnie added: “The last thing we wanted to do is ask for help but nothing could have prepared us for the situation we are in. “My dad has always been a very hard working family man, starting working as soon as he was old enough to to support his family. “He’s been an amazing father to us eight children. “If he survives this, his le will be very dferent.

Boris Johnson addressed the nation on Saturday evening, just hours after the first cases of the iant in the UK were confirmed.Travellers coming to the UK will have to take a day two PCR test and anyone who is traced to have been in contact with someone who tests positive will have to isolate for  days. Daily Covid cases in the UK have risen by . per cent in just a week as just under , new positive results were recorded today. The UK has seen a total of , cases over the last seven days, with yesterdayrecording , infections and  fatalities. By simply entering your postcode in our interactive tool below, you can check the number of confirmed cases in your area Following the PMaposs announcement at pm, masks will again be mandatory in shops and public transport, and the Government has urged everyone to do their bit by getting their booster jab. The first case of the Omicron iant was reported to the World Health Organisation from South Africa earlier this month, but in the last week cases were confirmed in Italy, Germany and Czech Republic. Earlier today the UK Government confirmed two cases in Chelmsford, Essex and Nottingham.  The Prime Minister said: This is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new iant and maximises our defences. A tweet from the PMaposs office said: COVID UPDATE: All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status.They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace.Earlier today officials confirmed the first to Omicron cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham, forcing the PM to act. In a press conference from Downing Street, he also announced that all arrivals to the UK will face mandatory PCR tests. The Prime Minister added border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said.

Nichola Petermann was just  when she learned she had Hodgkin lymphoma and needed immediate treatment - forcing her to leave her dream job months after she started.Medics believed her symptoms, which included fevers, abdominal pain and night sweats, were a result of her contracting coronavirus in January.But as her illness got progressively worse she found herself taking painkillers six times a day in order to continue her day-to-day le. In the absence of answers Nichola, from Glasgow, repeatedly sought medical attention, but the likelihood of it being long Covid masked the advanced stage her cancer had reached. It was only after a visit to her grandmaaposs home that Nichola realised just how ill she actually was - because she needed more sleep and ate even less than her elderly relative. Charity bosses say they fear Nicholaaposs cancer experience could be replicated across the UK, as signs of cancer can be very similar to the long-term effects of coronavirus. When she was finally diagnosed with stage b cancer, her condition was so advanced that she was advised to start chemotherapy the following day - forcing her to leave her dream job working in TV which sheaposd started in December. Nichola told The Mirror: I did think it was long Covid for a long time, I had no idea how serious it was. Because I was working and it was harder to see GPs, it was really hard. I treated it myself with pain relief, but eventually it got to the point where I couldnapost handle it anymore. I was taking paracetamol six times a day, I donapost think they believed me when I said how much pain I was in. It was only when she visited her grandmother, who is herself battling stomach cancer, that she realised how ill she was. I noticed that I was sleeping more and eating less than she was, she said. That’s when I knew for certain that something was wrong. When the pain in Nicholaaposs abdomen and lower back became too much to bear, she contacted NHS , which referred her to an Immediate Assessment Unit because staff were worried about the amount of paracetamol she was taking.However, when ultrasounds and X-rays did not reveal a gynaecological problem Nichola was on the verge of being discharged before a final set of tests finally revealed how ill she was. I was told I was possibly going home, even though I was clearly in a lot of pain, she said. I was scared about having to leave. It was only after an ultrasound revealed oian cysts and trapped fluid that medics were finally able to give her a le-saving cancer diagnosis. By that stage her lymph nodes were swollen - another symptom she put down to long Covid - and doctors had to break the news that Nichola had Hodgkin lymphoma. I hadnapost heard of it, I didnapost know what it meant, she said. Itaposs a very aggressive cancer, but that does mean it can be easier to treat. As soon as it was diagnosed they realised how serious it was, I started chemotherapy the next day. Such was the urgency to start chemotherapy that Nichola was advised there was not time to undergo fertility preservation. She spent  weeks in hospital, with the treatment leaving her unable to walk and having to be fed through a tube due to muscositis. Nichola lost three stone during her time at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, and had to be helped by nurses to move around. She praised the dedicated medics who supported her during her treatment. Although they were also clearly short staffed, I never felt like it impacted my care at all, she said. Nichola was finally discharged in August, and a month later she was given the welcome news that her cancer is in remission. Still suffering from chronic fatigue and struggling to walk long distances, Nichole is hoping to be able toto work in the New Year.

In the meantime Nichola is determined to do something to support Blood Cancer UK, a charity who she said has been a huge help during her illness.Over the course of November she has been walking every day in a . mile challenge, and her fundraising page has already raised more than £,.Kate Keightley, head of support and service development, said: “During the peak of the pandemic, we saw far fewer people being diagnosed with blood cancer, and one of the reasons for this could be that some of the symptoms of blood cancer are easily mistaken for Covid. Symptoms such as fatigue, fever and night sweats can sometimes be dismissed or downplayed and the result can be devastating. “More than half of British adults cannot name any symptom of blood cancer despite it being the third biggest cancer killer in the UK. If you have symptoms that cannot be explained and are persistent, you should urgently make an appointment with your GP. While it is unlikely to be anything serious, it’s so important to get checked out.”To sponsor Nichola and support Blood Cancer UK, click here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsCancerHodgkins lymphoma\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Although there is no specic crime of assisting a suicide in Scotland, it’s possible that helping a person to die could lead to prosecution for culpable homicide. The States Assembly was asked to agree that assisted dying should be allowed on the island in limited circumstances. But the jury recommended that the law should be changed to allow this choice for those who are mentally competent and either terminally ill or unbearably suffering. Jersey’s Council of Ministers will now have to draft an assisted dying legislation to be debated by the States Assembly by the end of next year. The vote itself has received plenty of public support, with  per cent of islanders agreeing that the law should change.  Paul Gazzard, whose husband Alain du Chemin died of glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, welcomed the result. Alain had arranged an assisted death in Switzerland but his condition deteriorated before he could go there. Before his death, Alain contributed personal testimony to the citizens’ jury and wrote to States Members asking them to support a change in the law on assisted dying. Paul said: “I am delighted that States Members have chosen today to stand with terminally ill people and their loved ones and reject the ban on assisted dying. “The current law in Jersey meant that Alain was denied the right to die on his own terms at home, forcing us to try to arrange an assisted death abroad in the middle of a pandemic. “This sapped time and energy when both were in short supply, taking a toll at an already dficult time.” Dignity in Dying campaigns to allow assisted dying as an option for terminally ill, mentally competent adults with six months or less to live. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: “Today is a victory for common-sense and compassion. “The States Assembly has listened to the public and the clear mandate given to them by the citizens’ jury to fix this broken law.” “Momentum for change is building right across the UK and Ireland, and Jersey is now leading the charge.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON DignityPoliticsFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hotel cleaner Leslie Southam lives with his elderly parents in a red-brick home kept with pride in the middle of Brynmefys, an estate a couple of miles from Llanelli town centre. The family have lived there since the mid s when it was a bustling community but the remaining homes couldnapost be further from Leslieaposs childhood memories.The attached property is being swallowed by a tree, its door boarded up and its windowsills decaying, reports WalesOnline. He believes that we are in the last days before Jesus Christapossto Earth and the apocalypse. The way things are going, itaposs only going to be seven years at most, he told WalesOnline.  It is one of  properties in a similar — or worse — condition on the estate, which began emptying in the s as the council floated plans to develop the area. Carcasses of homes are rotting, roofs collapsing, nature taking back the land and windows smashed. The streets are fenced off in places and have piles of rubbish dumped where, while the sign for the abandoned community hall rusts and fades.  Leslie, , was born in Cardigan and moved to Brynmefys with his English parents aged seven. Their home is now one of only three on the estate still occupied. A couple of cars parked on the road are a reminder of le. Leslie said: To be honest itaposs quite nice here. Itaposs quiet. My mumaposs  and my dadaposs . They like it here. I am past caring. I donapost think anything will ever be done. Carmarthenshire council have been doing the same thing over and over for years. They seem to get money for this and that, then it disappears. Weaposve had lots of dferent schemes but nothing has ever been done. And itaposs ended up like this.  He says he doesnapost really miss the Brynmefys of his childhood, an estate absolutely full with cars and people and children. While remembering the estate of yesteryear and explaining the current situation Leslie says there is another reason he has given up on development plans – he believes the world will end in seven years. When he explains why his dad bought their home under Right to Buy in  he says: He was buying it for the plot rather than the house. It was either rent for the rest of your le or buy this. He got it for almost nothing. You wouldnapost even buy a car for it.  After the scheme to redevelop the estate fell through in the late s many homes were derelict and unfit for renting. Thanks to a grant in the s Leslieaposs family were able to make key renovations to theirs but many other occupied houses were also falling into disrepair. His and the two other households on the estate live in privately owned homes but the land Brtnmefys is built on is council-owned.  The estate is in Carmarthenshire, the county with the most empty homes in Walesbut also the fastest rising house prices, which surged by  per cent to £, in the year to March. But the council has repeatedly failed to sell the estate and plans for developments have fallen through. Now a protected species of bats occupy many of the homes making demolition a tough task. A full report on the scale of the problem is due in January.  The sewage network is also not up to scratch and fixing it would require buying out the current owners. But the councilaposs offers have been rejected despite the fact Leslie says his parents would consider selling for the right price. Media coverage of the estate has led to an influx of teenagers who turn up in cars thinking the area may be haunted. Fences with aposdanger - keep outapos warnings pinned to them have been erected as a result. Leslie said: For some reason kids in their late teens were always turning up thinking there were ghosts here. They would come in their cars on weekends and try to get into the houses. Now a security guard waits here at night every weekend.

Poppy and Lola need to wear knitted woolly jumpers most of the year - and even sun cream during the summer. The Staffy sisters are both real ‘head turners’, according to Bournemouth based Staffie and Stray Rescue, who are currently looking after the girls. Their lack of fur is a result of a genetic skin condition, and means they need regular medicated baths and extra TLC. But the white pied Staffies still love nothing more than a good tummy rub. Staffie and Stray Rescue welfare operations manager, Sophie Vye, said: “We see all sorts of reasons why dogs come into rescue but circumstances like this are really sad because it’s no-oneaposs fault. “The family did what they could to help, but with other pets in the family, the only way was to surrender them to rescue. “They’re really lovely natured dogs and are bonded, so they will be needing a home together.  “Poppy and Lola have settled quickly in their foster home, and love sleeping on the bed and cuddling on the sofa like typical Staffies.”When Poppy and Lola were first introduced to the Staffie and Stray Rescue Facebook followers, their post was seen by over two million people - yet two weeks later, they’d received zero applications.But there has been more interest in the hairless hounds in recent weeks, as well as floods of people offering to knit them woolly jumpers. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. Sophie added: “As the temperatures continue to drop as we push into winter season, we are looking for knitting experts who could knit a jumper for our girls. As they are hairless, they will need to be kept as warm as possible - and we’d love a red jumper for Poppy, and pink for Lola, to help us tell them apart! “We’ve had a few people offer to make some jumpers for them, and it’s likely they’ll have a whole wardrobe soon.” The seven-year-old dogs are currently in a foster home, and are looking to live in an adult-only home with no other dogs, cats or children.Sophie added: “Lola loves cuddles and giving lots of kisses. She is a very loving girl but can be nervous around children and other animals. She gets anxious outside of the home environment and will be looking for a home who can help build her confidence and give her further training.“Poppy loves having her belly tickled and she loves to curl up on your lap to sleep - she also likes to snore loudly when she sleeps. “She prefers shorter walks but walks really well on the lead.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON TeamDogsAnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The move, reported by the Sunday , may be seen as something of an olive branch after the airing of the show, which alleges staff from Prince Harry and Prince Williamaposs households briefed against each other, ruffled royal feathers. Harry said: Maybe people know this and maybe they don’t, but the term Megxit was or is a misogynistic term, and it was created by a troll, amplied by royal correspondents, and it grew and grew and grew into mainstream media. But it began with a troll.  The episode tomorrow will examine the “circumstances around the decision of the Sussexes to step down from their senior royal roles”. It is expected to air claims of a lack of support for Harry and we Meghan and of a senior household member helping a tabloid in its court case against her. Harry and Meghan moved to Calornia in the spring of  to lead a more independent le, quitting royal duties to live as private citizens. They have since signed a lucrative commercial deal with Spoty and Meghan has written a childrenaposs book which got mixed reviews.  Harry has said that part of the reason for their departure was the racist treatment of Meghan, whose mother is black and whose estranged father is white. They have since given an extensive interview with Oprah Winfrey explaining their decision. They currently live in LA with son Archie and daughter Lilibet.The Palace has dismissed the documentary as overblown and unfounded with fears it has seriously damaged the relationship between the BBC and the royal family. Jenny Afia, the Duchess of Sussex’s lawyer, will appear again in the second episode, which covers  to  as will other royal commentators and those close to the couple. A rare joint statement by Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace said: “A free, responsible and open press is of vital importance to a healthy democracy. However, too often it is overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources that are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.

Six-month-old tabby Dave caused chaos at Tracey Goreeaposs Lincoln home, crashing into the tin and covering himself and much of the room in paint. The -year-old full-time carer rushed downstairs to a scene of devastation. She said: I heard a noise from the kitchen and knew straight away that Dave was up to mischief. I slowly got up as I was talking to my partner at the time and as Dave had already been messing about in the sink, I wasnapost too worried. She added: Suddenly I heard a crash so I rushed into the kitchen to be met with a sauntering, paint splashed kitten and complete devastation. I remember a panicked aposoh my god, no! No, no, no, no!!apos and covering my wide open mouth with my hand. It was absolute bloody chaos! My partner and I had pots of paint on the side ready for decorating. One paint pot was on top of another and probably had a slightly loose lid.  Little Daveaposs antics took the couple hours to clean up. Tracy added: I scooped up the worst bit with a dustpan and a piece of stf cardboard whilst my partner showered Dave. When he came down we both got a bucket of warm water and washing up liquid for the floor. The paint everywhere  was already starting to dry so we poured salt on the worst of it.  This acts as an abrasive and we were able to scrub clean the worktop, kettle, toaster and bread bin. It was midnight by then so we decided the rest could wait until we decorate. It took two of us two-and-a-half hours to clean up. But despite his mischievous ways, Tracey says Dave is a very lovable kitten. She said: Dave is cute, sweet, adorable and very loving. We rescued his mum and sister when she was just pregnant so Dave has been with us since day one.

Two cases in the UK were found in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex, both of which are believed to have been contracted in South Africa.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the emergence of Omicron showed the pandemic is far from over during a hastily convened No press conference on Friday.Rules in England have changed to make face masks mandatory again in shops and on public transport from Tuesday, and travellers arriving into the UK will now need to have a PCR test done within two days of arrival. Scientists have said they are concerned about the B... iant as it has around  dferent mutations - which is double the number present in the Delta iant. How  is this new iant dferent from previous versions and how dangerous is it  When did it first appear  UK scientists first became aware of the new strain on November  after samples were uploaded on to a coronavirus iant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.A total of  samples have been uploaded to the website so far. Three samples are from Hong Kong, three are from Botswana and the rest are from South Africa. On Friday, it was confirmed that cases had been identied in Israel and Belgium and on Saturday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said two cases had been found in the UK.What are the symptoms of the new iant The doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent. How is Omicron dferent from the other iants Despite only being tracked for the past five days, the virus has already been found to have  dferent mutations. The mutations contain features seen in all of the other iants but also traits that have not been seen before. Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: We will continue to work closely with the international community to quickly gather and analyse information on this iant to understand any possible increase in transmissibility or resistance to vaccines. It is important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR testyou have symptoms, isolate when asked, wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, ventilate rooms, get your vaccine and boosters as soon as you can.Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser of the UK Health Security Agency , told BBC Radio aposs Today Programme: If we look at those mutations, thereaposs mutations that increase infectivity, mutations that evade the immune response both from vaccines and from natural immunity, mutations that cause increased transmissibility.Itaposs a highly complex mutation, thereaposs also new ones that we have never seen before. Will the vaccines protect people against Omicron It is too early to say. Work is under way to see whether the new iant may be causing new infection in people who have already had coronavirus or a vaccine, or whether waning immunity may be playing a role. Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, has said the new iant will almost certainly make vaccines less effective, though they would still offer protection. Pfizer BioNTech, which has produced a vaccine against Covid-, is already studying the new iantaposs ability to evade vaccines. Experts have said vaccines can be tweaked to tackle new iants as they emerge. Mr Javid said: We know this is new out there. We donapost know enough about it yet. But for what we do know, we know that the protections that we have, especially the vaccines, are hugely important.What do we know about the cases in the UK There are two known cases of Omicron in the UK that have been traced back to southern Africa. Updated information from Essex County Council said the cases, which are linked, are in Brentwood and Nottingham and those who tested positive are self-isolating and contact tracing is being carried out. Mr Javid said targeted testing and sequencing of positive cases in the affected areas will take place. He said anyone who has travelled to the  countries placed on the red travel list - Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia - in the last  days must isolate and take a PCR test. He said: This is a real reminder to us all that this pandemic is far from over. Andthereaposs one thing that everyone can be doing right now is,theyaposre eligible, please take your vaccine when itaposs your first shot, your second shot, or your booster jab. If youaposre eligible, please take a vaccine. He described the new iant as deeply concerning, and said: I think the importance of them, especially the booster vaccine, is now even more important. Have any countries been put on the red list in relation to Omicron Yes. Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe were suspended from midday on Friday and all six countries have been added to the red list. On Saturday, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia were also placed on the red list. Mr Javid told the House of Commons on Friday that discussions are ongoing on whether more countries should be added to the list.What does this mean for travellers  The UK and Scottish governments and Northern Ireland Executive said on Thursday that UK and Irish residents who arrived between midday on Friday and am on Sunday, and who have been in the  countries within the last  days, must quarantine at home for  days and take NHS PCR tests on day two and day eight, eventhey already have a lateral flow test booked.Passengers - including UK and Irish residents - arriving from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel and quarantine for  days. They must also take tests on day two and day eight. Direct flights from the  nations to the UK are being temporarily banned until am on Sunday, for the quarantine hotels to be set up. Since midday on Friday, non-UK and Irish residents who have visited the nations in the previous  days have been refused entry into England. Residents in the Republic of Ireland will also have to undergo testing and quarantiningthey have recently ed from South Africa. The Irish Government has it will align with the EU recommendation to apply the emergency brake and to discourage travel to or from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, Angola, Malawi and Zambia. Other countries including Germany, Italy, France, Israel, Japan and Singapore have also restricted travel over the iant.How worried should we be about this iant There are fears the virus transmits more easily and that it could be more deadly and evade vaccines. However, scientists have said it is too early to confirmall of these fears are correct. They are eager to acquire live virus cultures so it can be examined, but this takes time. It can take seven to  days at least to grow enough virus that can be shared with other scientists so they can study how it mutates and changes. Officials will now also have to wait for data to come from South Africa. The earliest they are expecting evidence to come through is two to three weeks, but it could be as long as four to six weeks.

The -year-old, originally from the Kurdish region of Iran, was fished from the freezing water before succumbing to the waves and the cold. Mr Shekha desperately clung to a lejacket to survive until a rescue vessel reached him. And, speaking to his brother from Calais, he has vowed to try the deadly crossing again. He had been travelling to the UK to find a job to pay for his younger sisteraposs medical bills, which doctors told them would cost thousands of pounds. His brother Marwan, , told The Sunday Times : Itaposs a miracle. He canapost swim at all. I donapost know how it happened.He added: All of a sudden, he found himself in the water too. He said he canapost stop thinking about the other people who died in front of him. It keeps coming back in his mind. He didnapost know how to rescue the women who fell in. The Sunday Times reports that Mohammed and his brother worked, saved and mortgaged a plot of family land so they could take out a , loan before contacting a smuggler.  Mohammed was then flown from Syria to Belarus from where he could enter the EU. Once he reached northern France, and with Marwan helping him, he made contact with an Iraqi-Kurdish smuggler in Turkey, who charged him , on top of the , for his bid to get to the UK. As Marwan worried about his elder brother on Wednesday evening, he received a video call. It was Mohammed on a paramedicaposs phone, barely able to speak. By Friday he was recovered and back in the Calais camp. He spoke to Marwan again, reports the Times, saying: I’m doing this for my family. If I come back, I can’t make a living. I’m going to try again.  Other details have emerged regarding the  people who died in one of the worst ever disasters in the Channel. A relative identied -year-old Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, known to her family as Baran, as one of those who died on what was the deadliest day of the migration crisis. The student was said to have been trying to join her fiance, who already lives in Britain, as her cousin urged the British and French governments to help people resettle rather than force them to take this route of death. Krmanj Ezzat Dargali told Sky News: The situation is just awful. She was a woman in the prime of her le. I understand why so many people are leaving for a better le, but this is not the correct path. Itaposs the route of death.  Also among those who died was Harem Pirot, , and his friend Twana Mamand Muhammad, both from Rayna in Iraq, according to The Observer. Mr Pirot had been trying to reach England to meet his brother Anwar, a Sheffield graduate living in Cambridge. The Observer also said there was a family from the Iraqi Kurdish town of Darbandikhan - Khazal Hussein, , and her children Haida, , son Mubin, , and younger daughter Hasti, seven. Ms Husseinaposs husband, Rezgar, said: My we and children were unhappy with our le here. They wanted us all to go to the UK. I told them I couldnapost come because of my job as a policeman. I would lose it. They insisted to go so I agreed I would join themthey made it, andthey didnapost, they could come back. I never knew it was risky.

As a working mum of two, I really feel for her. Early years are hard, juggling work, childcare and le with not much sympathy or empathy. But there are two threads to her story. First, a mother’s right to take their baby into their working environment – in Ms Creasy’s case cocooned to her chest in a sling while a debate was going on. Unfortunately that right had been taken away by a parliamentary rule banning infants from the chamber – now to be reviewed. For me, taking my babies to work at three months old would have been the last thing on my mind – in smart clothes, breastfeeding and all the bits and bobs such as wipes, bibs, nappies etc. I like to keep work and my personal le separate – for my own sanity and the baby’s too.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I breastfed for eight months, in shopping centres, parks and cafés. But I’d never have done it in front of colleagues in a meeting. Not because of embarrassment, but out of consideration for those without kids and who may feel uncomfortable seeing my breast out and a baby suckling while discussing a profit statement. Also, the Commons is no place for a baby’s natural development. Mine during this early stage were keen to learn through touching, hearing, smelling and looking – they’d make gurgling sounds, let out screams of excitement and yelps of joy – this is what they should be encouraged to do. SoI were in a meeting with my child strapped to my bosom, I would be distracted and feel guilty for not giving both my child and colleagues my full attention. Also, is Ms Creasy trying to set a precedent for all women to have the right to take their baby into their work environment  So will a TV presenter have the right to read the news while breastfeeding  Can a police officer have her baby with her on patrol  Can a teacher take hers into the classroom  Where do we draw the line  On a parenting course, a key message for me was that it’s important to put the needs of the child before your own. The second thread to Ms Creasy’s story is the need to make holding down a job easier for mums – so more creches at work, help with childcare and more nursery places.  As an MP, Ms Creasy already has it all – maternity leave on full pay, use of the family room in Westminster, an on site nursery, £, for a locum to cover constituency work for six months, and a baby leave proxy vote while away. Being allowed to vote remotely in those early years, between  and , instead of trudging into Westminster for late-night isions would be good sense. I think these are the points Ms Creasy should be making. Waving your flag for having babies in the Commons just makes a mockery of more fundamental challenges for working mums everywhere.

Britain is set to offer a team of up to  elite troops from the Special Reconnaissance Regimentto help French police tackle the crisis. The undercover soldiers may even disguise themselves as migrants in an attempt to infiltrate traffickers. It comes as harrowing stories continued to emerge of the  migrants, mostly from a camp near Dunkirk, who perished when their boat deflated in the Channel on Wednesday. They include Kurdish bride-to-be Maryam Hamdamin, , who was trying to get into the UK to join her fiance in Bournemouth.Migrants in squalid makesht camp told the Sunday People how smugglers were still offering deadly trips across the Channel despite the latest deaths.Security chiefs have told Downing Street that the only way to control the vast numbers of people embarking on the voyage is to target traffickers.British diplomats hope the offer of special forces will improve tensions between London and Paris after President Macron cancelled a meeting with Boris Johnson over the crisis. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter One source said: “Last week’s tragedy was a tipping point which was always going to come. “The UK has a lot of assets which could be used to help the French clamp down on the traffickers. It is accepted that trying to stop migrants coming across the Channel doesn’t work. The key to the problem is the traffickers. If they can’t , the migrants can’t cross. “Whether or not France will accept the offer remains to be seen. These things are always diplomatically fraught and no country likes to admit that it needs help.” Operators from the regiment could be used to track and film traffickers and hand over the intelligence to the French authorities. It is also understood that Britain’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ will offer to hack into the criminal gangs’ mobile phone networks.  British and French special forces have a close relationship and are working together against Islamic terrorists in Mali, West Africa. The SRR is the most secret part of UK special forces and is the only elite unit to recruit women. It specialises in aggressive surveillance and is often deployed on operations regarded as too dangerous for MI. It supports the police and MI on counter-terrorist operations in the UK and often works with MI officers on foreign missions. The regiment has fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria and troops often disguise themselves in local clothing such as Arabic robes. Similar measures could be used to identy people smugglers, it is claimed. At least  men, seven women – including bride-to-be Maryam and another who was pregnant – and three children are known to have died in Wednesday’s doomed trip.  Mohammad Aziz, , is another feared drowned after he phoned a friend to say: “It’s not good, the engine isn’t powerful enough – I don’t knowwe’re going to make it.” He has not been heard of since his frantic call to a fellow Iraqi Kurd. Fears were also growing for a group of Afghan youngsters who are missing. Riaz Mohammed, , his relative Share Mohammed, , and two other teenagers, Palowan, , and Shinai, , were attempting the crossing that day. One charity worker at the camp said it was dficult to know who had died as UK authorities confiscate mobile phones of those who do get across. A migrant who has tried and failed to cross the Channel four times told how Calais is so dangerous he carries a gun.  Mohammed Hutamzadth lives in sheltered accommodation after travelling to France five years ago from Iran, where he was a car park manager. The -year-old previously boarded trucks at the ferry port and Eurotunnel in his attempts to cross into the UK. Each time he was caught by French police and sent to detention centres where he would spend about seven hours before being freed. Mohammed said: “It is too easy to find a smuggler here, you just ask around. Living here is very dangerous, there is a sort of mafia who control everything. Everything is le and death. I have to have a gun for protection. “I have no passport, the only ID I have is this paperwork and some of what it says is not even correct. “Here in Calais, money is god. As long as I have money I will easily find someone who will take me in a boat.  “Or maybe I will try and buy a boat myself. Everyone heard about the people that drowned of course, and it is sad. It is a risk that I still wish to take. “I will take a boat next month. Of course it is dangerous. But my whole le has become dangerous.” Remnants of rubber dinghies littered the sand dunes on the coast at Wimereux near Calais yesterday. We found a cardboard box marked Scuba Schools International containing two water pumps and a makesht water scoop.

A yellow warning for snow and ice remains in place until mid-morning on Sunday in Scotland and the north of England.The Met Office has warned of a risk of wintry showers and icy stretches.Temperatures were expected to struggle to get above freezing in some parts, with -C forecast in Manchester and Newcastle. The Met Office said it would be a cold and frosty start to the day, with showers affecting eastern coastal areas.  It added that there is a risk of icy stretches, with snow showers becoming more extensive over parts of Scotland and the north-west of England early on Sunday. The cold spell comes after three people were killed when trees were blown over in strong winds as Storm Arwen hit on Friday. Gusts of almost mph also saw transport disrupted, power cuts and damage to buildings, while heavy snow saw lorries get stuck and ploughs being used in a number of areas.  Summing up the damage caused by the first named storm of the season, the Met Office said the strong winds and a mixture of rain, sleet and snow led to power cuts, transport disruption, trees fell, there were large coastal waves and blizzards affected some hills. Marco Petagna, a Met Office forecaster, told the PA news agency: Weaposve seen some pretty severe gusts overnight with the highest speeds hitting mph at Brizlee Wood in Northumberland.  Elsewhere, exposed sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland also surpassed mph, with -mph seen more widely in the north of the UK, though parts of southern England and Wales also felt the effects of the storm. This has been coupled with a few inches of snow which has fallen in some areas. In the higher ground areas of Scotland we expected to see up to cm falling but the strong winds meant the snow blew around and created a blizzard in some parts.  Police Scotland said a -year-old man died when his pick-up truck was struck by a falling tree on the B Dyce to Hatton of Fintray Road in Aberdeenshire at about .pm on Friday. Cumbria Police said a man from Lancaster died in Ambleside after a tree fell on him just before pm. In Northern Ireland, a man was killed when his car was hit by a falling tree in County Antrim. Wind speeds reached mph in Orlock Head, Co Down. Inverbervie on the north-east coast of Scotland had gusts of mph, while Aberporth in Wales saw speeds of mph.  People were advised to be wary of travelling, as train networks across the UK reported disruption to services. All Avanti West Coast services North of Carlisle were cancelled on Saturday, with customers strongly advised not to attempt to travel on the route. ScotRail services were disrupted between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street, Dunblane and Stirling after a barn was blown on to the line close to Polmont, near Falkirk.Passengers travelling on an Aberdeen-bound train on Friday had to wait  hours at Huntly railway station in Aberdeenshire due to the extreme weather. TransPennine Express customers were urged not to travel, with services between Newcastle and Edinburgh cancelled. South Western Railway services were disrupted on Saturday due to multiple trees and obstructions blocking the railway, while London North East Railway warned customers not to travel north of York due to signicant damage.

Faye Harding tipped the scales at st lbs and used to eat a multipack of crisps and two huge takeaways a week. But after seeing a photo of herself she decided to take action, switching to a diet plan and losing three stone in just two months before discovering her ex was cheating on her. But rather than pushing the -year-old back towards unhealthy choices Faye used it to spur her on and she lost another four stone. She built up her strength with weights, started the Couch to k programme and in just  months dropped to st lbs. The insurance worker from Chipping Sodbury, Bristol, said: “I’d go so far as to say that I was addicted, I’d be eating non-stop no matter what the emotion. “Every time I ate, it gave me a temporary high, and I craved that. “I ended up wanting to lose weight when my mum took a picture of me last year, and I just looked at it and felt awful about myself. But I knew I couldnapost do it alone so I started The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, I noticed that the weight was just falling off me. “I lost three stone within two months and then I found out my ex was cheating on me. But I refused to use food as a coping mechanism. It spurred me on even more to try and shed the weight, as well as taking the time to focus on myself.  Faye used to consume over , calories per day - eating full sharer bags of cheese Doritos and full packs of biscuits, alongside large portion meals each day. She would spend up to £ a week on snacks and bad food habits alone each week, on top of the weekly food shop. She said: “I loved crisps they were my favourite snack. “I’d easily be eating two or more packs a day, alongside a sharer bag a week. “The Pringles logo is quite true really, once I had a bag of crisps open, I couldn’t stop. “I’d be having about two takeaways a week, with all the trimmings,I got a curry, I’d have the naan bread, poppadom’s, rice, chips and a starter. Faye turned to The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan, which substitutes large portion meals and bad snacking habits with shakes and healthy alternatives. She said: “I started running, which was dficult at first, but I definitely started to notice a dference, especially with the muscles in my legs. “I invested in some weights and built my strength up to do the Couch To K scheme which helped me lose another two stone. “With the diet, I was eating and drinking  calories a day which is a lot less than my intake originally. “Instead of three pieces of toast and sausage bap for breakfast, I’d be having a smoothie or porridge. “The : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan has given me a new appreciation for food. “I eat so much healthier now, and focus a lot on proteins, I really enjoy cooking and experimenting with healthy greens.” Faye is now thriving, she has recently become a homeowner and has a doting partner called Chris Moore, , who is a tech delivery manager. She said: “I’ve finally reached a goal weight that I can maintain. “A lot of my friends were shocked as they didn’t realise just how big I was, and they can’t believe the dference. “I can’t believe how far I’ve come, I’ve even had to buy a whole new wardrobe. Some people have said I should send a photo to my ex, but I donapost care. I did this for me!

Today Dutch authorities confirmed that  passengers on a flight from South Africa had tested positive for the mutant strain. It means at least  countries have confirmed cases, with several others investigating suspected instances. It comes after Belgium became the first European country to announce it had identied the strain on Friday, while health officials in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic have identied suspected Omicron cases. It has sparked a new wave of travel restrictions, with further countries likely to bring in measures to limit the spread of the iant. Experts across the world are scrambling to determine whether Omicron is more deadly and whether it evades vaccines. News of the iantaposs spread have prompted alarm among world leaders, with Israel bringing in a blanket ban on international travellers. The iant has now been detected in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, South Africa, Australia, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.  Additionally health authorities in the Czech Republic yesterday said they believed they had identied cases, and were carrying out tests to confirm this. Austria is also investigated suspected instances of the iant within its borders.Yesterday Health Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed that two cases of the mutant strain had been found in the UK - one in Brentwood, Essex, and the other in Nottingham.Last night Switzerland was among the first to respond to the UKaposs announcement by stating that people arriving from these shores would have to isolate for  days, even after testing negative. This morning officials in Australia announced two cases of the iant had been found in passengers arriving in Sydney from southern Africa.  Both were asymptomatic, fully vaccinated and in quarantine, health officials in New South Wales said. It follows in the footsteps of Germany and Italy confirming their own Omicron cases. The German state of Baia announced two confirmed cases of the iant yesterday. Meanwhile In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new iant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique. On Friday Belgian authorities said a person travelling into the country from Egypt had been found to have the new Covid strain.  It is feared that the emergence of the Omicron iant, described by scientists as the most complex mutation yet, could prolong the pandemic further. Israel said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country and reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology to contain the spread of the iant. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that the ban, pending government approval, would last  days. Interior minister Ayelet Shaked said: Our working hypotheses are that the iant is already in nearly every country, and that the vaccine is effective, although we donapost yet know to what degree.Yesterday Boris Johnson announced that people arriving in the UK from abroad would have to do a PCR test and isolate until they have confirmation of a negative result. The iant, classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation , was first detected in South Africa, but it is not known where it originated. Following its discovery countries across the world, including the UK, slapped travel restrictions on the country and a number of its neighbours. South African officials have hit back, saying they are being penalised for scientic excellence.Many countries have slapped restrictions on ious southern African countries over the past couple of days, including Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Iran, Australia, New Zealand and the US, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new iant.The UK put South Africa, Botswana, Lesostho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia on its red list on Friday, and yesterday added Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola. Switzerland yesterday widened its quarantine rules to travellers arriving from Britain, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Egypt and Malawi, its health ministry said. Anyone travelling from these countries will need need to present a negative Covid- test and quarantine for  days as well, the Federal Office of Public Health said in a tweet.

The Thursday evening announcement meant that South Africa was added to the list from Friday at pm, so all flights were suspended and those arriving in the UK were forced to isolate for  days. From am on Sunday, this quarantine period will need to take place in a hotel. Countless Brits, including Jessica and Michael Dickinson were caught in the sudden announcement, and now find themselves stranded in South Africa, currently with no way home. Jessica, , described the situation as a “worst nightmare come true”. They had had their daughter Amelia-Rose, -months-old, during the pandemic, and none of their relatives from South Africa had seen her yet, so once restrictions lted, the pair booked a trip out to introduce her to her family. “Many people haven’t been home for quite some time, but we had our daughter and wanted her to meet the rest of her family. “When the borders opened we thought it was a great opportunity to come and see our family, we’d had a couple deaths in the family, so we thought it was important to make the trip out. “We moved to the UK and have been here for  years, we recently had our daughter and have had no family support raising her. Nobody’s met her, this was an opportunity for them to at least meet her, because people are getting old and you never know when it will be somebody’s last time.” After flying out last week, the family from Surrey were due totonight. The first they knew about the announcement was when Amelia woke Jessica up crying, and she checked her phone to see messages from a friend about it. However, as they were due toon Friday they thought they would be okay to fly home as usual. Then they got an email from British Airways saying their flight was cancelled. “It’s literally just a snowball effect of everything, getting home, my daughter being sick, jobs,” Jessica said. “My daughter’s also not been very well, she’s had a bad chest infection and I’ve been keen to get her back to the UK to have her looked at so this has really thrown us off. “In the morning , we went down for breakfast and we overheard some other Brits talking about how they were all trying to rush off. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. “There were people rushing to get PCR tests and take flights that had like three stayovers. But we can’t do that, we have our daughter.” Jessica described how they had sat on the phone for hours trying to get through to ious airlines to no avail, and even how the British consulate was “useless”. “Both me and my husband are due to start back at work on Monday, but I don’t have my work laptop and we have to figure out childcare this side, whilst still paying for our nursery that side. “It’s been relentless.  “We nearly finalised another flight with Emirates on Tuesday evening, and were ready to pay until it was cancelled. “We understand we’ll have to do the hotel quarantine but we’re worried about doing it with our daughter and I’m ADHD. I’m worried about what it’s going to be like on the other side. I get that’s what it needs to be like to get back home. On the journey back they face a bill of thousands because of the government’s actions as they have to book new flights and then pay for hotel quarantine too. British Airways, like all airways operating to and from South Africa from the UK, learned about the governmentaposs ban the same time as everyone . Given no prior-warning, they were left scrambling to try and organise a way home for the Brits stuck abroad whilst having very little to no guidance from the government. They have set up a dedicated phone line for Brits in South Africa and now Jessica, Michael and Amelia have a flight booked in for the th to get them home.

And there’s one particular part of the UK where the night sky is better than anywhere  to look up at the stars and see the meteors, Milky Way, andyou’re lucky - the aurora borealis. The Brecon Beacons National Park, in Wales, is an internationally recognised dark sky reserve, meaning there is an exceptional quality of starry nights with limited pollution blocking them from view.Brecon Beacons Holiday Cottagesrecommend grabbing your binoculars this winter, and heading to Wales to witness the spectacular Geminid meteor shower, which can be seen from the Brecon Beacons during the month of December.The Northern Lights have been spotted from the Brecon Beacons and are most likely to be seen on a dark clear night in the autumn equinox from October to March.  Autumn is also the best time to see the Milky Way from the Brecon Beacons, which looks like a hazy band of light that stretches out across the night sky. Meanwhile, there are  dferent constellations in the sky and prominent ones to look out for include The Plough which points to Polarisand Orion’s Belt which is next to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. An aptly named one to try and spot while you’re in Wales is Draco the Dragon - it’s a long curve of stars that swirls around Polaris in the northern part of the sky. The International Space Station orbits the earth once every  minutes and you should be able to recognise this white dot as the brightest object in the night sky, with Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn also visible from Earth. Fancy a spot of stargazing in Wales  Here’s where you should head to: Carreg Cennen  Enjoy wonderful views over the Carmenshire countryside from the ruins of Carreg Cennen. It has a spectacularly elevated spot on a limestone ridge and dark skies that are perfect for stargazing. Usk Reservoir  Located high in the Usk Valley, this peaceful reservoir is protected from light pollution. It comes with lots of parking and flat surfacesyou fancy setting up a telescope. Llanthony Priory  This remote Augustinian priory is nestled in the secluded Vale of Ewyas. The lack of any light pollution means you can enjoy some of the finest dark skies in Wales. Hay Bluff  You can enjoy spectacular views over Powys and Shropshire from the car park on Hay Bluff. Hay Bluff forms part of the Black Mountains. Libanus  The Brecon Beacons National Park Visitor Centre is based just outside the lovely village of Libanus. There is lots of information and facilities to help you make the most of stunning views over Pen y Fan. Top tips for stargazing in the Brecon Beacons: Stargazing is an activity that’s accessible to all but planning ahead and bringing along a few key items will help you to get the most out of your evening of spotting stars.

It can take around  minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark night sky and you should try and avoid further light pollution from torches and mobile phones. Red-light torches are best for night vision and phones should be changed to a night-time setting. Evenings in the Brecon Beacons can get rather chilly so it’s a good idea to bring along several layers of clothing and have hats and gloves at the ready so that you can keep warm as the night-time temperature starts to drop. A compass will help you to know which direction youaposre facing when you’re looking for particular constellations in the sky. Most smartphones have a compass app on them to help you work out north from south. Although you’ll be surprised at just how much can be seen with the naked eye, bringing along even a cheap pair of binoculars will help to enhance your view so that you can see even more stars in the sky. There are several useful smartphone apps to help you find specic constellations in the night sky including SkyView Lite and Star and Planet Finder.

I was writing a fantasy novel at the time and I needed a map at the start of the book to show where the characters were going, that kind of thing. I thought rather than paying someone , I would give it a go myself just for the hell of it.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here So as a practice, I did my home region of Teeside in that style and just got a lot of positive feedback from it and I thought maybe this could be the direction to take things. After recreating his home region in the style, Chris has gone to recreate other countries and smaller UK regions, in a bid to include places of interest.Chris said: I post a lot on Facebook so I do a work in progress when Iaposm halfway through and Iaposve got all the major settlements and locations in.I share that in ious places and say to people, what  do you want to see on there.  I get a lot of feedback in that sense because you get loads of people commenting and messaging just saying can you put this local barrow in. A few of the shipwrecks as well - a lot of people were asking for them. I was like thataposs a quality suggestion actually, Iaposll stick that in I wouldnapost have thought of that. I could easily go and google the top  or  things to see or do in Merseyside, get your main things, but you never get your details like your shipwrecks and stuff so reaching out to the local community is great. I enjoyed all the history and all the dferent time periods. Going from Medieval and Roman to quite modern things as well, which I am quite happy to include. I try and tweak them to make them fit the fantasy theme as well. The ex-Aldi worker spent  hours on the map featuring Merseyside and made sure to include the regionaposs iconic landmarks past and present. He now sends prints of his creations on his Etsy store, ranging in size from A to A, as well as large canvas prints. You can find Chrisapos Etsy store by clicking here . Chris added: Iaposm going around the whole of the UK and trying to do all the counties in that style. Itaposs going to take a while. I want to get all the counties done and compile them into one massive fantasy atlas. Weaposre talking years down the line but thataposs the goal, I think.

The Roses tin sampled appears to be even numbers allowing for a iation in the tin filling. I agree Quality Street appears to be uneven. More data please.  Another added: I am always taken aback at how many of those circular gold toffees there are. I put them straight in the bin as the ratio of toffee cost to filing replacement cost is off the scale. A third wrote: Suspicions Confirmed! Never enough of The Purple One! A great Math provocation for data too! Responding to the pages findings, a Nestlé spokeswoman said: “We balance our Quality Street selection by grouping the sweets into three categories that we know our consumers love: fruits toffees and fudge and nuts, chocolates and caramels, with each roughly making up a third of the total. We don’t give exact numbers for each sweet as the contents may y. We know that Quality Street fans feel very passionately about their own particular favourites, so we ensure there is something for everyone within the mix.” And for those concerned about the lack of Purple Ones or Green Triangles, rest easy, you can make your own tin. The spokeswoman added: “We know that Quality Street fans feel passionately about their favourites and there is something for everyone within the mix.If you’d like a tin that’s packed with nothing but Purple Ones, oryou can’t resist a Green Triangle, you can create your perfect mix by visiting our website – www.qualitystreet. ”Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Chocolate\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Not content with the drab surroundings, Emma Parkes, , has turned her bland cottage into a multicoloured paradise - and she managed it on a small budget, Emma, , from Shropshire, who works in special needs education, moved in  months ago with her daughter Poppy, , and her son Ralph, eight. Keen to make the place feel more homely, she stripped out the old carpets to reveal rustic floorboards, which she then painted white, with permission from the landlord.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Picking a “feminine and uplting” colour palette to replace the magnolia, the mum-of-two added pops of colour into every room - spending a total of £, on the renovation. “When I first arrived, the cottage was all magnolia, but structurally sound,” Emma said. I knew I wanted to inject colour with a boho style enjoying plenty of plants throughout the house.” The first room Emma tackled was the lounge, where she spent £ overhauling the furniture with “retro” secondhand buys and creating a feature wallpapered wall. She said: “I first decorated the lounge with a colour palette of green, pink, soft pink and vivid pink. “The walk-in fireplace also had exposed brick which I freshened up with some white paint and I created a feature wall with wallpaper gted by Lust home.  “I removed the curtains and replaced them with a natural branch with plants hanging from it, I’ve also created this in my bedroom. “The windows are very pretty to look at plus the view is incredible, so I didn’t want to hide either of these with curtains.” In the kitchen, Emma spent just £ and uses her creative skills to paint a bright pink and aquamarine mural across one of the walls. The mum said: “The kitchen was the first room where I painted one of my murals on the wall. All my murals are hand-painted and original. It is very much floral-themed and uses bright but soothing colours. “The use of plants continues into the kitchen where I’ve hung a reclaimed ladder from the ceiling with flowers hanging from it.” Emma, who has done all of the work herself, began DIYing her home as a way to deal with the grief of suddenly losing her dad in .Documenting her home’s transformation on her Instagram account@tallulahcottage, which now has , followers, Emma has shared her hard work with her followers.

Outside the quaint cottage is surrounded by fields, with a large driveway and garden, that wraps around the cottage “giving sunshine all day”. Emma said: “My outside space is very big and a wonderful canvas for some future plans. It’s taken me about a year to get to where I’ve got with my home. “I’m a single mum and work full time so it can be hard to achieve the work I do on my home quickly, I dip into it as and when I can.” The mum credits her “creative thinking” for being able to carry out the renovation on such a small budget. Emma said: “My budget has definitely always been on a shoestring so I often have to be creative in my thinking and I source practically everything second hand. “My style is definitely always evolving and I do love change, I’d describe my style as boho with a vintage twist. “I love to style flowers in with my interiors and this features a lot throughout my home, and my colour palette consists of uplting feminine colours that are definitely good for the soul.”Breakdown:Kitchen - £ second-hand furniture and paint for the muralLounge - £ second-hand furniture, paint.

The -year-old shot dead their daughter, who was his partner at the time, as she cowered in a bathroom on Valentineaposs Day in .Pistorius is now close to winning parole, and as part of the process, Reeva’s parents Barry and June have agreed to see the man who murdered their daughter. The disgraced athlete had been serving his .-year sentence at the “comfy” Atteredgeville Correctional Centre in Pretoria. However, he is now close to being freed.  Reeva’s elderly father Barry, who has been treated for a heart condition, and we June said that the long journey to meet him face-to-face was too much for them. So the prison authorities decided to bring Pistorius to the Steenkampaposs under high security and the utmost secrecy to make sure the meeting could happen. An hour before dawn on Friday he was “ghosted” out of Atterdgeville prison and driven the  miles to St Albans Correctional Centre which is near their home. The -hour journey saw Pistorius being transported in a prison van with a police car escort before he arrived at the notorious Port Elizabeth prison facility. It is one of the five most dangerous prisons in South Africa and houses  of the most dangerous killers and rapists in the criminal justice system.  There are constant riots and running battles between rival gangs inside the run-down jail and warders have been murdered trying to keep control. Pistorius was taken away from the main jail population where it is said the cells hold up to  dangerous prisoners each and to a secure single cell for safety. The convicted killer who murdered Reeva by shooting a hail of bullets through a bathroom door when she was cowering inside agreed to the meeting. It is not known exactly when the meet will take place but it is understood that Reeva’s parents will be driven to the medium-security prison next week. They were contacted by the SA Department of Correctional Services in October and askedthey would agree to meet Pistorius and said yes. A warder at St Albans told HeraldLive: ”He arrived late yesterdayand is being temporarily kept in a single cell far away from everyone ”. Attorney Tania Koen, who represents Steenkamp’s parents who live in Port Elizabeth  minutes from the prison confirmed the move. She said both Barry and June were “fully aware” that their daughter’s killer had been transferred from Gauteng Province near to them in Eastern Province.  Koen added: “There will be no further comment on this matter”. Department of Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo confirmed they had to work out logistical arrangements to move jails for Pistorius. Pistorius became unexpectedly became eligible for parole in July after the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled the  days he already served behind bars before being sentenced to -and-a-years had not been counted. He was initially sentenced to  years in prison in October , for culpable homicide but the State challenged it and in  it was changed to murder and . years. With time served before the increased murder sentence, Pistorius has now served half of it and through his attorney, the killer launched his bid for parole.  His repeated trials gripped South Africa and the world as he claimed he was trying to “protect” Reeva thinking an intruder was in his bathroom. He fired a hail of mm bullets through his bathroom door fatally hitting the model four times after crawling across his bedroom floor on his stumps. The former athlete still insists that he believed that she was an intruder. Pistorius was dubbed Blade Runner after being fitted with prosthetics to allow him to walk then run after both his lower legs were amputated when he was  months old due to a birth defect. He went on to become a Paralympic World Cup gold medal champ in the m and m and was the first double amputee to run in an able-bodied Olympic Games.

Dr Angelique Coetzee says she was first alerted to the possibility of a new iant when patients at her Pretoria private practice had Covid symptoms that did not make sense. They included young people from a range of dferent backgrounds all with intense fatigue and a six-year-old child with a high pulse rate. None of them suffered from a loss of taste or smell, both symptoms which are heavily associated with apostraditionalapos Covid. “Their symptoms were so dferent and so mild from those I had treated before,” said Dr Coetzee, a GP for  years who also chairs South Africa’s Medical Association.  On November , when four family members all tested positive for Covid with complete exhaustion, she informed the country’s vaccine advisory committee. She said in total about two dozen of her patients have tested positive Covid with symptoms of Omicron - which the world is now scrambling to contain with ious travel bans. They were mostly healthy men who turned up “feeling so tired and about half of them had not even had a single dose - a prevalent issue in South Africa and in swathes of the African continent.  South African scientists say Omicron is behind a sharp rise of cases in the country’s Gauteng province. In the UK, the government has slapped several southern Africa countries on the red travel list - although small numbers of cases have been reported across Europe. There are two confirmed omicron cases in the UK.All international arrivals will have to take a PCR test by the end of their second day in the UK, Boris Johnson announced yesterday evening as he prepared to reimpose measures to control the spread of coronavirus over fears the new strain could evade existing vaccines. The Prime Minister said the temporary and precautionary measures will be reviewed in three weeks, while the Governmentaposs vaccine experts will be tasked with considering whether to extend booster jabs to all over-s.Health Secretary Sajid Javid will be questioned on the details of the restrictions, including on when exactly they will be introduced, during broadcast interviews on Sunday.Mr Johnson announced the strengthening of Englandaposs rules at a Downing Street press conference, after two cases of Omicron were identied, in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex, with both linked to travel to southern Africa.

While a reference in the Latin version to ldquoRegem angelorum, meaning lsquoking of the angels, may instead be an anti-Hanoverian message of opposition to King George II.Dr Bradley says there is a string of indicators to suggest there is more to the carol than a celebration of the infant Jesus.ldquoThe early manuscript mentions lsquoour King Jamesrsquo in Latin, which appears to be a reference to the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, son of James VII.ldquoAnd there are Stuart cyphers and thistle decorations.ldquoWade was a plain-chant scribe who had gone to France almost as an exile, where he copied manuscripts and taught Latin. As you might expect from an English Catholic college in exile, they did not have much time for Hanoverians.The song was sung only in Roman Catholic places of worship for decades, while carols ndash even those which praised Jesus and celebrated his birth ndash were shunned where.ldquoThey were very much seen as rather vulgar and populist and did not come into the Church of England until  and in Scotland until the end of the th century, he adds.ldquoInstead, they were sung outside in the street, outside pubs and homes where the church did not have so much control.St Francis of Assisi ndash regarded as lsquothe Father of Christmas Carols ndash is said to have inspired the birth of the Christmas carol in the th century after he created nativity scenes in a cave and invited people to sing and worship around a manger.But while Franciscan friars brought songs praising the Christmas story from Italy, churches preferred hymns based strictly on the scriptures, and viewed carols as having Pagan connections, associated with fertility rituals.ldquoWhen we look at the earliest use of the word lsquocarolrsquo in English language in the s, it seems to be a round dance with singing associated with fertility, and no religious signicance, Prof. Bradley adds.ldquoFranciscan friars were bringing songs to the people here, they picked them up and would sing in streets, homes and pubs, but not in church.As carols became more popular, their role for delivering hidden messages grew, he adds.ldquoThe Twelve Days of Christmas was possibly a Catholic song used to teach Catholic doctrine - the five gold rings are the five sacraments of the Catholic Church.ldquoThis was possibly post-Reformation, and the song used to teach tenets of Catholic faith when they were forbidden to practise their faith.While another, Angels from the Realms of Glory, is believed to contain subversive messages from its author, James Montgomery, a Scots-born political radical who had been twice imprisoned for his support of the French Revolution and reform riots in Britain.ldquoThe original last verse talked about justice repelling the sentence of those who had been in prison and mercy breaking the chains, adds Dr Bradley.Perhaps more in the spirit of Christmas, It Came Upon the Midnight Clear contains a message of peace and a call for an end to stre, written by Edmund Sears, a minister in Massachusetts with strong liberal views who wanted peace and social reform.ldquoHe wrote it after there had been particularly bloody revolutions in Europe and a costly war between the United States and Mexico, and it contains the words lsquoO hush the noise, ye men of stre, and hear the angels singrsquo, adds Dr Bradley.ldquoItrsquos a fairly universal sentiment but tempered by his own political instinct.Prof. Bradley will reveal the secrets behind Christmas carols during a talk next Fridayat Scotlandrsquos first religious literary festival, organised by the School of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh.The festival, part of celebrations to mark the th anniversary of New College, the home of the School of Divinity, features a programme of  events, including an exploration of the relationship between religion and crime writing in a presentation by crime author Val McDermid.Best-selling author Robert Harris will discuss portrayals of power, religion and politics in his work, including Fatherland, Enigma and the Cicero trilogy.Acclaimed author Charles Foster and broadcaster Sally Magnusson will also take part, while actor, comedian and writer, Miles Jupp will explore the complex connections between religion, comedy and literature.The festival runs between December -.

It may be because things are so delicate that small movements have produced big changes.The also note that high levels of vaccination and high levels of infectiousness - as per the Delta strain - is ldquonew territory.: Scottish Government Covid advisors optimistic about run up to ChristmasTo understand why experts are perplexed, however, it is worth remembering just how dire some of the modelling for England was in the run up to its lsquoFreedom Dayrsquo on July , the date when nightclubs reopened, social distancing ended, and mandatory facemasks and work-from-home diktats were scrapped.In the weeks before, cases were climbing rapidly and reached , on July .Modellers forecast that Freedom Day would quickly propel England to , cases a day with hospitalisations potentially exceeding the winter Alpha wave.Hospital admissions in England have remained fairly high, but flat, in comparison to Scotland where admissions surged in SeptemberInstead, confirmed infections fell rapidly to around , by the end of July and have hovered ever since in a range of around ,-, per day.Hospital admissions have also remained steady at - per day, a quarter of the January peak.In contrast, Scotland - which delayed its Freedom Day equivalent until August  and maintained masks and home working - saw cases rocket nearly five-fold in less than four weeks, reaching more than , by the beginning of September.Peak hospitalisations, at  per day, were nudging levels seen at the height of wave one.And while infections have largely plateaued in Scotland since the beginning of October, the two nationsrsquo case rates are closer together than any other parts of the UK despite their respective governments very dferent approaches to the pandemic:  per , in Scotland, and  per , in England.Source: Public Health EnglandMask critics have pointed to the experience in Scotland - and Western Europe - compared to England as evidence that they are a useless mitigation.But John Burn-Murdoch, a visiting senior fellow at London School of EconomicsData Science, whose work on Covid statistics is widely acclaimed, described the focus on masks in October as ldquooverly simplistic, politicised and at times flat-out wrong.By mid to late-September in Scotland - where masks were required in shops, schools, public transport, and hospitality - weekly Covid case rates in the over-s, hospitalisations per , and deaths per million were roughly twice as high in Scotland as England.And herersquos the second set of charts, again separating Eng + Scot:bull Itrsquos true: Scottish governmentrsquos mask guidance means no-masking remains much less common there ##bull But when it comes to mixing in large groups and crowded spaces, Eng  Scot are almost exactly the same pic mWnAAnMoBut, crucially, once masks were set aside, behaviours were almost identical in both nations in terms of public transport use and socialising in large gatherings or crowded spaces.As Burn-Murdoch stressed, this is not proof that masks do not reduce incidence - they do, by around % - but that the benefit may be outweighed by other factors which more strongly encourage transmission.ldquoJust because masks are the most visible thing and the most easy for identying lsquobad peoplersquo to make ourselves feel a little better, theyrsquore not the only factor or even the most important, he said.: Vaccine passports will not be extended to pubs, cinemas and restaurants - for nowDavid Male, a professor of biology at the Open University who specialises in immunology, vaccines and iants, said the most likely answer is that Scotland coincided its lsquoBeyond Zerorsquo phase with schools ing in England, pupils went back six weeks after Freedom Day.ldquoI do think that quite probably the coincidence of those two things is responsible for that spike, said Male.ldquoBecauseyou take out that spike at the end of the summer in Scotland, whatrsquos happening across the United Kingdom is pretty similar in all four nations.He added that while masks have little impact on exponential growth, they become more important once cases are flat.ldquoIf yoursquove got an epidemic thatrsquos really taking off like it is in Austria, it needs more than mask wearing to get a hold of it.\"Butyoursquove got something like what we have in the UK, measures like mask wearing can make the dference between the R value being above one and being below one, which makes a dference between the epidemic spreading or dying out.ldquoA small change in the rate of transmission now could, in six weeksrsquo time, make a big dference to the incidence.Another theory is that Scotland paid the price for having had a lower prevalence of the virus compared to England earlier in the pandemic.: Why the new Omicron iant has scientists scaredProfessor Rowland Kao, chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, believes this could have been key.He said: ldquoIn an ironic way -you did better before you have less immunity now. Immunity obviously declines, but a fair bit sticks around.ldquoGiven that, broadly speaking, Scotland has done better over the course of the pandemic it means that the proportion of iniduals exposed to the disease is lower, and that means yoursquove got less population immunity.It is certainly true that by the end of July, a higher percentage of adults in England than Scotland were testing positive for Covid antibodies - but the gap was just .%: .% compared to .%.In some age groups though the dference was wider: for example,roughly eight in  over-s in Scotland had antibodies against nine in  in England.Rowland KaoIt is dficult to say whether this was enough to swing the epidemic, but there is a growing consensus that the UKrsquos earlier and consistently higher exposure to Delta compared to Europe is now paying off -

Members managed to elect a new committee and secure time to be able to carry out a structural report for repairs to the clubhouse. Had they been unable to elect a committee the lease would have been lost with the site reverting back to arms- council organisation City Property.Former Scotland and Queens Park player Joseph TaylorIn  Mr Brown, who was then with Hampden Bowling Club, discovered a railway map proving Hampden Bowling Clubrsquos legendary tale and this year digs were carried out in a bid for hard evidence. And with  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international, Mr Brown believes now is the time for Scotlandrsquos contribution to football to be recognised and the site of the first Hampden being protected.Read more:Scotlands first national football ground faces uncertain futureMr Brown leads what has become known as The Hampden Collection and Footballrsquos Square Mile - the Worldrsquos Biggest lsquoOpen Airrsquo football museum in Glasgow which follows the discovery of the foundation stone of the Worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground.Mr Brown, who will bring together a  of guests for the event, said: ldquoThe next stage of the footballing journey is to get the entire st Hampden Site recognised as the epicentre of World Football. However, to do that, and to bring the story to le, we have brought in a number of other sites that have huge signicance in the story of football, and as launched earlier this year, created the worldrsquos biggest open air football museum.ldquoIn our opinion, this is the way to stamp Scotlandrsquos claim, and also brings huge amount of opportunity to tell this story. Footballrsquos Square Mile is the way to do it and the campaign to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site will be launched this week which will be one year to go until the th anniversary of the worlds first international football match.Joseph Taylors great grandson Colin discovered the grave in Cathcart CemeteryMr Brown realises it will be a dficult process, but says they are ready for the campaign.ldquoWith the timing and signicant dates next year, along with the possibility that Scotland could be playing at the World Cup, we want to put the spotlight on just how important the discovery of the first Hampden and Footballrsquos Square Mile is. If this was anywhere  in the world that could lay claim to the beginning of football as we know it, it would be a world tourist attraction so why not here.Carrying out a geophysical survey, as well as excavating six trenches in the Queens Park Recreation Ground and Kingsley Gardens site, the archaeologists revealed evidence of the foundations of the first Hampden Park pavilion where the first players to play for Queens Park and Scotland would have got changed before matches and where the team officials would have sat.One of the sites on the Hampden walking tourThey also found tantalising evidence of the original playing surface, sealed beneath over a century of earth and grass, as well as numerous artefacts dropped by the early supporters including beer bottles, juice bottles and clay pipes.Dr Paul Murtagh, Senior Project Officer at Archaeology Scotland who managed the st Hampden Dig Team, said the project was unique in more ways than one as it brought people together.Dr Murtagh said: ldquoThis was a project which was part of Archaeology Scotlandrsquos New Audience Project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland, and brought people from dferent backgrounds and nationalities together. Football was the hook for this and while it not be their own countryrsquos heritage they were helping to establish part footballing heritage.ldquoWe were very lucky to have records to got on but it was when we dug the trenches and with the use of geophysics we could really pinpoint the site. The findings, which included artefacts from people who would have stood on the terraces, really give you something tangible from that moment in time.A group enjoying the Hampden tourGlasgow Football Tour founder Lindsay Hamilton had been aware of the myth surrounding the site of the first Hampden Park, but like many people didnrsquot think much more of it.It was only when Mr Brown approached her to consider working on a Hampden walking tour that she found out more.ldquoIrsquove been offering tours around Glasgowrsquos five main stadiums for many years and I love telling people about our footballing heritage, said Ms Hamilton. ldquoBefore covid I had been taking tourists from all over the world to Hampden Park, Ibrox Stadium, Celtic Park, Cathkin Park and Firhill as well as part of a -minute minibus tour.ldquoGraeme was on my first tour and I remember him saying to me do you want to help me save Hampden Bowling Club and I wondered what he was talking about, but it was the rumour that it was the site of the first Hampden which Graeme then went on to find the map from the National Records of Scotland which showed where it would have been.Due to covid restrictions Ms Hamiltonrsquos minibus tours of the football grounds couldnrsquot go ahead, so a walking tour of the Hampden sites was developed.ldquoThe idea came about for the walking tour bringing in the three Hampden sites and was a chance to be able to tell the story of and signicance of the beginning of world football and the game we know today, Ms Hamilton added.ldquoPeople were keen to get outdoors and embraced walking more during lockdown and we ran nine walking tours this year. When you tell people about the history behind the first Hampden Park they are in disbelief. I think people on the tour, who were all Scottish as we still didnrsquot have international visitors at the time, felt very proud and we want people to go on tell the story and pass it on. The first Hampden needs to be protected and should be celebrated as the site where the modern game watched by billions around the world began.One football fan who joined the tour had a particular interest in Scotlandrsquos football heritage as he is very much part of it.Colin Taylor, the great grandson of Joseph Taylor, was drawn to the tour on his first trip to Glasgow to investigate his football history.ldquoI was always told as a youngster that Joseph Taylor played football for Queens Park, Colin said. ldquoLater I was told he also played for Scotland, but kind of took that with a pinch of salt. When my father passed away in  I started to get interested in family history and with my fatherrsquos brother, my paternal uncle, who was by then in his mid s, started looking through old photos and we found one of Joseph and one of his grave. My uncle said he had looked for Josephrsquos grave in the rsquos but assumed it was in Langside and thought it had been lost during bombing in the Second World War.Ten yearsrsquo ago Colin discovered the location of Taylorrsquos grave by accident.Colin added: ldquoIt was a simple email to Cathcart, I emailed every cemetery in Glasgow, and I discovered where he rested. I was also contacted by the historian Andy Mitchell who sent me more information on Joseph and a photo of his grave.ldquoI saw an opportunity this year after lockdown to go to Scotland for a few days and visit Josephrsquos grave and visit Hampden. I was intrigued by the three Hampdenrsquos story and the discovery of the very first Hampden.ldquoI joined a walking tour in September and I achieved my ambition of seeing Josephrsquos grave, seeing the original Hampden where he played, and Queenrsquos Park where he also played and practised.I could feel goosebumps looking at the old pavilion at the bowling club and imagining Joseph not only playing there but also being instrumental in some major decisions as he was president of Queens Park for a year after he finished playing in ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13244757.jpg?type=article-full","title":"christmas-gifts-theatre-live-performance-lovers","story":"Roald Dahlrsquos The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar ticketsImagine a Roald Dahl magic show.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

Christmas ldquoas normal despite new rules to combat the Omicron coronavirus iant.He said on Sunday it was ldquonowhere near time to reintroduce social distancing rules and work-from-home guidance, despite a raft of precautionary measures being reintroduced to tackle the concerning strain of Covid-.Passengers arriving in the UK have been told that from Tuesday morning they will have to take a PCR test for Covid-, with the expectation they will have to self-isolate until they test negative.All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status, amid concerns that existing jabs will be less effective against the strain, which is believed to spread rapidly.Details of the plans were incomplete when announced by Boris Johnson after two cases of the iant were confirmed in England on Saturday, but Mr Javid said the ldquoface-mask rules are planned to come in on Tuesday to bring the nation back closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.He said it ldquowould be irresponsible to make guarantees during the ever-changing pandemic, but told Skyrsquos Trevor Phillips on Sunday: ldquoI think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think itrsquos going to be a great Christmas.With the Government stopping short of introducing its Plan B to tackle Covid- this winter, Mr Javid downplayed there being a need to reintroduce social distancing rules or work-from-home guidance.ldquoWe know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health, he told Sky.ldquoSo,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and wersquore not there yet, wersquore nowhere near that.Mr Javid said he expects to receive new advice ldquoimminently, within the next couple of days, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationafter it was tasked with reviewing whether boosters should be extended to all over-s.The group will also consider whether second doses should be offered to  to -year-olds, and whether the waiting time before a booster jab could be reduced.ldquoIrsquove also asked the NHS to prepare for much greater capacity in our vaccination programme, Mr Javid told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC.Professor Anthony Harnden, the JCVIrsquos deputy chairman, told BBC Radio rsquos Broadcasting House that extending the age range for boosters and reducing the delay before receiving them was ldquoa sensible strategy and told under-s to expect third jabs to be offered to them ldquoearlier than we had previously envisaged.Mr Javid said the testing regime for international arrivals will be introduced ldquoas soon as possible, despite online passenger locator forms stating PCR tests will be required rather than lateral flow tests from am on Tuesday.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said they intend to mirror the border restrictions.He admitted that passengers flying in from southern Africa before  nations were added to the red list were not tested on landing and could have taken public transport tohome.ldquoI think the speed at which we acted at could not have been any faster, he said, adding those arrivals before the change had been contacted and told to take tests.Cardf Rugby has said the team is unable to leave South Africa following two positive cases of Covid-, one of which is suspected to be the Omicron iant.In a statement, the club said its players had ed to their hotel to isolate having been booked on to a flight set to depart on Sunday afternoon and it is now working with authorities to ensure the partyrsquos safe passage home when appropriate.New measures are being introduced as a precaution to slow down the spread of the #OmicronVariant of #COVID:##Face coverings in shops  on public transport##PCR tests for international arrivals##Self-isolation for contacts of suspected Omicron casesMore info #mdash Department of Health and Social CareNovember , A spokesperson said: ldquoEverybody concerned in this highly challenging situation would like to thank their families, friends, colleagues and the wider rugby family for their many messages of concern and well wishes.Professor Neil Ferguson, the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmember whose modelling helped instigate the first lockdown, said he expects to see ldquosubstantially larger numbers of Omicron in the UK in the coming days but welcomed the new measures as ldquoproportionate to slow the spread while scientists analyse its properties.ldquoThatrsquos not to say we can be complacent,we do see very rapid growth of Omicron ndash and thatrsquos a bigat the moment, and we have no guarantee we will ndash butwe do then, undoubtedly, I think the Government would be wise to keep all options on the table in terms of how to respond to that, He told BBC Radio rsquos The World This Weekend programme.Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, called for the Government to ldquoimmediately reinstate pre-travel tests because the new approach ldquoleaves far too many gaps with potentially infected passengers able to travel home on public transport.Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, called for additional resources to police ldquoangry passengers who refuse to comply with the reintroduction of masks.During an emergency Downing Street press conference on Saturday, the Prime Minister announced the ldquotemporary and precautionary measures were needed after two cases of the new iant first discovered in South Africa were detected in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex.The iniduals and their households were ordered

transmit between the double-vaccinated and may partially reduce the protection of existing vaccines.He stopped short of announcing his Plan B to tackle Covid- this winter, which includes mandatory use of vaccine certicates in certain venues and reinstating work-from-home guidance.Government advisers on Sage said during a meeting on October  that home working is likely to have the greatest inidual impact on transmission out of the measures in Plan B, which they said would have the greatest impactintroduced in unison.To further slow the arrival of cases, ministers said Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday, when they will join South Africa and five other neighbouring nations on UK red lists.Mr Javid told Times Radio it is planned that the new regulations will be laid in Parliament on Monday, with MPs expected to be given a vote within  days and after they come into force.A number of backbench Tories may stage a rebellion, but it is thought unlikely Labour would oppose the restrictions, virtually guaranteeing that they will pass.The UK, Germany and Italy all confirmed the presence of Omicron on Saturday after the iant first detected in South Africa was reported to be in Belgium a day earlier.Experts hope existing vaccines will still be good at reducing serious disease from Omicron, but manufacturers are looking at tweaks to make them more specic to the iant.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

They join South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini already on the list.It is understood there are three main areas of concern for Stormont’s health officialsthe new iant is problematic: the effectiveness of the vaccine, the clinical impact on the region’s already pressurised hospitals and its transmissibility.Almost three million vaccinations have been administered to the public here in the form of first, second and in some cases third vaccines or boosters. More than , people were tested for the disease in the past week.It is hoped such readiness will help in the fight against the latest iant.However, Northern Ireland still has the highest infection rate in the UK or Ireland and the lowest vaccination rate, though the numbers of people in hospital with the virus are decreasing slowly.Mid Ulster Mid and East Antrim Antrim and Newtownabbey and Causeway Coast and Glens have had notably high infection rates of above  cases per , population.There was some optimism yesterday when a scientist behind the Oxford vaccination spoke favourably that the existing vaccines will be effective against Omicron and that it is “extremely unlikely” that it will cause a “reboot” of the pandemic — a sentiment echoed by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar.Professor Andrew Pollard, who helped create the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, said experts would need to wait “several weeks” for confirmation but said existing jabs could still be effective at presenting serious illness.As well as the UK, several cases of the iant have been identied in Belgium, Germany, the Czech republic, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel.More than  people who arrived in the Netherlands on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid. Dutch authorities are trying to establish whether the passengers have the new iant.The World Health Organisation has said the iant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection.Read MoreNetherlands confirms  Omicron cases as travel curbs tightened across the worldOmicron iant spreads to more countries as world on alertIsrael tightens travel restrictions over new Covid iantHowever, little is known about it, specically whether it will escape vaccines.In the Republic, scientists have begun analysing data taken from samples dating to the start of November at its Backweston facility for markers of the new iant.Yesterday, Cillian De Gascún, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he hopes to have preliminary data tomorrow on whether the new iant has been detected in Ireland.Dr De Gascún said he was concerned about the new iant, but that it was too early to tell how prevalent it could become. He said there was no evidence yet that it would evade vaccines or cause more severe disease.However, he added, information emerging from South Africa suggests it is even more transmissible.Mr Martin said the new restrictions coupled with the booster vaccine campaign will ensure “intergenerational engagement that will happen around Christmas time will be less hazardous for the vulnerable”.However, the Ombudsman for Children Dr Niall Muldoon said he expects the Government to have “robust plans” to protect access to school, education support and social interaction.“We are approaching the third calendar year of this pandemic and there are still challenging times ahead,” he said.Meanwhile, the new Covid certication scheme here in Northern Ireland will not be mandatory in unlicensed premises “at this stage”, the Department of Health has said.Under the policy, which will be introduced in draft form tomorrow, people wishing to gain entry to designated venues will need to demonstrate evidence of Covid- vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the previous six months.But such a scheme would require Assembly approval.Most ReadA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmDerry Girls star Jamie-Lee: ‘I got asked out all the time... by women’Principal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Northern Ireland is most dangerous place in Europe for womenTop VideosPlayBoris Johnson announces tightening of coronavirus rules after new iant reaches UKPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolateLatest CoronavirusLindy McDowellOpinionThe Covidiots who gurn about losing their liberty curtail it for the rest of usStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home messageNI cricketers may have to quarantine onfrom ZimbabweViewpointOpinionWhat is it we want from the elected Public urged to stay calm after news of new Covid iantLatestIn Pictures: Snow blankets parts of UK as temperatures dropTaiwan scrambles jets after  Chinese planes enter buffer zoneSNP to bring motion of censure against Boris Johnson, Ian Blackford revealsMunster and Cardf delayfrom South Africa after positive Covid- testsCambodian prince and politician Norodom Ranariddh dies at ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland.

The same goes for age and stage, for example, just because a jigsaw says  pieces and age from three years it does not mean your three year will be able to do it especiallythey’ve never done a jigsaw before. Remember, too, it’s all well and good saying he’ll be able to do it in the summer, that’s six months away,he can’t nearly do it now, and won’t be able to with a bit of help don’t buy it or there’ll be tears, snotters and grumps from you both. Personal  Social -doll and teddy to cuddle, feed, dance and play with or even just look cute sitting on the bed! Role Play Toys -such as tea set, pram, brush, hoover, kitchen to make dinner - or dinner for dolly! Imaginative Play -cars   fire engine   digger, train with track or a garage for cars -it’s got a ramp even better. Or Peppa Pig swing and slide, farm, Noah’s ark, bus with people to go on! Happy Land offer a great range in early imaginative play toys. Or traditional dolls house, rockets, play mobile sets etc. Animals -farm animals - maybe use pretend grass for the field. Animal figures to name, to later match baby to mum or add to imaginative play. Themed animals for older children - boys and bugs, girls and sea animals. Bricks And Block -mega blocks or wooden bricks to build and knock down and later to sort colours and shapes, or make into buildings and tunnels. Of course, there’s lego, meccano and magnetic building toys too. Puzzles -peg puzzles,  Cause And Effect Toys -for younger children, to press buttons, push levers left and right, turn handles for noise   lights   new sights, wooden hammer bench or a press and spin toy. Or maybe noisy toys, xylophone, drum and of course an old favourite the laser zapper that makes that awful noise.  Push and Pull toys -dog on a rope, rainbow wheel, duck with a handle - defo for those just walking. Outside -sit-on scooter, sit in car, balance bike, bubble fish, pull and play wagon or slide. Balls, to kick, throw, learn to catch or throw through a basket ball hoop. For older children hula hoop, roller skates or Space Hoppers!!! Special Place -tent with cushions, maybe a garden house or even just fairy lights and voile to go around her bed  Craft -chunky crayons and paintbrushes, finger paint, maybe try water colour paints for your budding artist, or an easel. Playdough sets, jewellery making, aeroplane building, wooden car making - what does your child like  Bath Time -ducks or boats to float, dolly to bath, smelly bath bubbles, or even a packet of jelly bath!  And to finish, the rhyme I say every year, buy me … and remember … Something I want, something I need, something to wear, something to read. Something so I can play a game with you, something that helps me learn too. Something to help my imagination grow, something creative to make or sew Something for inside, something for out and maybe a surprise I can tell my friends about! Everything doesn’t have to have batteries or be plugged in, Technology is great in small amounts, but it’s time to play with you that counts. So this Christmas time buy what I like and need, don’t go mad and buy up the shop, Think of the things we can do together,because its time to talk, sing, read and play, Which builds my future every day!

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mr Martin says the Government will have to keep its options open on further restrictions, explaining: NPHET have put in a caveat also that further measures can not be ruled out...can be very honest about that. His warning has been echoed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who said that it is impossible to saythere could be a lockdown in the future. Minister Donnelly added that whilea lockdown cannot be ruled out, it is not where we are currently as a nation. Other measures that are due to be introduced by the govt include: People will be told to work from home, under recommendation from NPHETVaccine passes will be required to access theatres and cinemas but not at hairdressers, barbers or gymsStrict rules around mask wearing for indoor and outdoor settings.  In addition to the new rules, two other measures aimed at reducing transmission of the virus were also revealed.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music. She’ll also be supporting Damien Dempsey in the Millennium Forum on Saturday th January and tickets can be got for that herewww.millenniumforum shows damien-dempsey . Remember something, the best music is right on your doorstep, it isn’t on Facebook, it doesn’t matter about likes on social medial or Spoty numbers, you can’t listen to music on computer, and it will never feel as good as seeing a band live and you can do just thatyou follow this yellow brick roadhttps:nervecentre.ticketsolve shows . You’ll see me at Jeanette’s gig on Sunday in the Nerve Centre, where I should point out her Blood co-conspirator and actual blood relative, sister Noella Hutton will also be playing and feel free to ask why I ended this like the Sopranos mid-  Magee on Music: Bloody Sunday . . .  years on  Special programme of events to mark th anniversary    Magee on Music: Still The Happiest Man in the World  Kevin Magee chats with local artist John Breslin    Magee on Music: New hope withof Stendhal Festival  Music festival at Stendhal -

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One.

Evelyn Cusack surprised him on set, and Johnny was thrilled to see her.  Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family.

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One.

Evelyn Cusack surprised him on set, and Johnny was thrilled to see her.  Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

It calls you to be salt and light about what you believe in, she said.ldquoIt does annoy me when people say you have to take religion out of politics and leave it at the doorhelliplike it only happens at the weekend. It is part of who you are.ldquoYour Christianity and your faith is something that is with you all the time. You canrsquot just leave it at home on Sunday night and go out without it on Monday.Mrs Foster said she does not hold grudges against those who had hurt her, including former colleague Edwin Poots, who ousted her from the DUP leadership in May before being forced out of office himself just weeks later.Reflecting on the decision by Sinn Fein to collapse the executive with the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in , she said: ldquoWe got into a spiral and we couldnrsquot stop it and it got to a point then where the assembly collapsed and of course I regret that it was down for three years.She said she liked the late DUP leader Ian Paisley very much. ldquoHe used to joke with me and say, lsquoHow are the Anglicans doing Arlenersquo Asked by Mr Kellyshe thought Dr Paisley had mellowed over the years, she said: ldquoI never knew Dr Paisley personally until   and I think he probably was in a dferent space than he had been in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties.She declined to speculate on what might have changed him. ldquoI donrsquot know.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

When Northern Ireland’s striker, Jimmy Quinn, sent a volley arcing past Pat Bonner’s outstretched glove in the second half, Windsor Park erupted with joy.The theme song that night, ‘There’s only one team in Ireland,’ had already been firmly established.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The chant had been heard first in Dublin, when the Republic’s fans taunted northerners during a - win. That mockery hurt, because Northern Ireland was traditionally the dominant force in Irish football, qualying for international tournaments while the south struggled. Now that Northern Ireland had taken the lead against Jack Charlton’s side the song was redeployed. The stands at Windsor Park shook with noise, as the Green and White Army reminded their rivals that theirs was the original Irish football team veterans of three World Cups and reigning Home Nations champions.Billy Bingham, the Northern Ireland manager, was retiring from international footballUnfortunately, minutes later, the Republic equalised and secured their place in the US. I still maintain that goal came from a free-kick that should not have been given. Nigel Worthington shoulder-charged Eddie McGoldrick perfectly fairly, but the referee decided otherwise.These are the decisive moments that haunt fans, but they are part of the game and the Republic was deservedly destined for New York. The saddest thing was that Bingham did not get the winning end that his career deserved. However, his team had restored a lot of pride with its battling performance. Of course, Northern Ireland was a troubled place in November . The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist attacks like the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel massacre. Northern Ireland fans at the November  game at Windsor Park. The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist massacres yet the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinisterDespite this deeply unpromising context, the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinister. I was only a teenager, but I had already seen more vitriol at club games and I would do so many more times in the years to come. That’s why I was delighted to read Mark Rainey’s two page spread, in Wednesday’sNews Letter , about the myth that Windsor Park was a cockpit of hatred that night. He explained in detail how the hood got started. The Republic’s manager, Jack Charlton, believed that Northern Ireland should have gone easy on his team. Famously, after the final whistle, he said, “Theybattled too hard... They will get no favours from us... ever.”This typically graceless comment set in train a series of inventions, distortions and exaggerations that were repeated asthey were gospel by generations of players, fans and commentators.As Mark noted rightly, none of these accusations were levelled at the home fans in the immediate aftermath of the match.Many of the modern preconceptions about Northern Ireland fans’ conduct seem to have arisen from the Marie Jones’ play, A Night in November. Soon these details were cited by pundits who were nowhere near Windsor Park, but who nevertheless portrayed it as a bastion of bigotry.The contrast between what I saw that evening and the hysteria that followed made a strong impression on me, even as a schoolboy. It showed me vividly thata myth was repeated often enough in Northern Ireland it became accepted as fact, not just by its nationalist inventors, but by neutrals and well-meaning unionists too. Even Northern Ireland’s advocates now tell a story about how fans transforming their behaviour after this supposed “night of hate”. This narrative highlights the way the atmosphere at Windsor Park changed over many decades, becoming more inclusive and family friendly, but it repeats a caricature that was never fair or real.Football fans have rarely behaved perfectly. They are passionate, get carried away and sometimes act aggressively and badly. No doubt, some Republic fans found the atmosphere at Windsor Park in  unpleasant or uncomfortable. They were not, it must be said, supposed to be in the stadium in the first place.The myth of the “night in November” has been perpetuated for so long that it is now unlikely ever to be dispelled. Thank goodness that a journalist has the courage to challenge it and explain its origins. It will mean a lot to very many people.

Latest news bulletins are reporting ever increasing numbers of confirmed cases of Covid- in the last few days causing hospitals and intensive care units to be overwhelmed, indeed to breaking point. Millions, many of them children, remain unvaccinated in impoverished countries, and at huge risk to infection, serious illness, and death.

That is also the message of today’s gospel narrative. Even in the midst of the world’s confusion and chaos, Jesus reassures us: “The Kingdom of God is near”. As dficult as it may sometimes be to discern its presence. Our Lord faced turbulent times as well – born of parents forced to seek shelter for the night in a cow shed – not exactly the palace of a prince or king. Yet, the surprise of Christ’s incarnation forces us to look again in our own age at the “signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars”, and to consider anew the signs of God’s involvement in the world about us.Advent is the season when we learn to overcome our “fear and foreboding” and once more open our hearts to others just as God has disclosed and demonstrated his love for us in Christ.Advent also reminds us that our spiritual winter will come to an end. The fig tree will again blossom and bloom. “Summer is near,” our Lord reassures us – even at the beginning of Advent. “Our redemption is drawing near.”Amid all the dficulties of this le, when uncertainty and fear loom near, may we ever look to Jesus, and put all our faith and trust in Him, mindful that His word and promise to His people “will not pass away”.Let us remember His timely warning: “Be on your guard”. We must always recall that, as the Gospel reminds us, our Lord will come like a thief in the night, and at a time when we least expect him. As we enter the Advent season, may we be vigilant, awake, and always on our guard for Christ’s ‘Second Coming’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

work-from-home guidance, despite a raft of precautionary measures being reintroduced to tackle the concerning strain of Covid-.Passengers arriving in the UK have been told that from Tuesday morning they will have to take a PCR test for Covid-, with the expectation they will have to self-isolate until they test negative.All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status, amid concerns that existing jabs will be less effective against the strain, which is believed to spread rapidly.Details of the plans were incomplete when announced by Boris Johnson after two cases of the iant were confirmed in England on Saturday, but Mr Javid said the ldquoface-mask rules are planned to come in on Tuesday to bring the nation back closer into line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.He said it ldquowould be irresponsible to make guarantees during the ever-changing pandemic, but told Skyrsquos Trevor Phillips on Sunday: ldquoI think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think itrsquos going to be a great Christmas.With the Government stopping short of introducing its Plan B to tackle Covid- this winter, Mr Javid downplayed there being a need to reintroduce social distancing rules or work-from-home guidance.ldquoWe know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health, he told Sky.ldquoSo,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and wersquore not there yet, wersquore nowhere near that..removeMr Javid said he expects to receive new advice ldquoimminently, within the next couple of days, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationafter it was tasked with reviewing whether boosters should be extended to all over-s.The group will also consider whether second doses should be offered to  to -year-olds, and whether the waiting time before a booster jab could be reduced.ldquoIrsquove also asked the NHS to prepare for much greater capacity in our vaccination programme, Mr Javid told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC.Professor Anthony Harnden, the JCVIrsquos deputy chairman, told BBC Radio rsquos Broadcasting House that extending the age range for boosters and reducing the delay before receiving them was ldquoa sensible strategy and told under-s to expect third jabs to be offered to them ldquoearlier than we had previously envisaged.Mr Javid said the testing regime for international arrivals will be introduced ldquoas soon as possible, despite online passenger locator forms stating PCR tests will be required rather than lateral flow tests from am on Tuesday.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said they intend to mirror the border restrictions.He admitted that passengers flying in from southern Africa before  nations were added to the red list were not tested on landing and could have taken public transport tohome.ldquoI think the speed at which we acted at could not have been any faster, he said, adding those arrivals before the change had been contacted and told to take tests.Cardf Rugby has said the team is unable to leave South Africa following two positive cases of Covid-, one of which is suspected to be the Omicron iant.In a statement, the club said its players had ed to their hotel to isolate having been booked on to a flight set to depart on Sunday afternoon and it is now working with authorities to ensure the partyrsquos safe passage home when appropriate.New measures are being introduced as a precaution to slow down the spread of the #OmicronVariant of #COVID##Face coverings in shops  on public transport##PCR tests for international arrivals##Self-isolation for contacts of suspected Omicron casesMore info #mdash Department of Health and Social CareNovember , A spokesperson said: ldquoEverybody concerned in this highly challenging situation would like to thank their families, friends, colleagues and the wider rugby family for their many messages of concern and well wishes.Professor Neil Ferguson, the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmember whose modelling helped instigate the first lockdown, said he expects to see ldquosubstantially larger numbers of Omicron in the UK in the coming days but welcomed the new measures as ldquoproportionate to slow the spread while scientists analyse its properties.ldquoThatrsquos not to say we can be complacent,we do see very rapid growth of Omicron ndash and thatrsquos a bigat the moment, and we have no guarantee we will ndash butwe do then, undoubtedly, I think the Government would be wise to keep all options on the table in terms of how to respond to that, He told BBC Radio rsquos The World This Weekend programme.Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, called for the Government to ldquoimmediately reinstate pre-travel tests because the new approach ldquoleaves far too many gaps with potentially infected passengers able to travel home on public transport.Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, called for additional resources to police ldquoangry passengers who refuse to comply with the reintroduction of masks.During an emergency Downing Street press conference on Saturday, the Prime Minister announced the ldquotemporary and precautionary measures were needed after two cases of the new iant first discovered in South Africa were detected in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex.The

he warned Omicron appears to spread ldquovery rapidly, can transmit between the double-vaccinated and may partially reduce the protection of existing vaccines.He stopped short of announcing his Plan B to tackle Covid- this winter, which includes mandatory use of vaccine certicates in certain venues and reinstating work-from-home guidance.Government advisers on Sage said during a meeting on October  that home working is likely to have the greatest inidual impact on transmission out of the measures in Plan B, which they said would have the greatest impactintroduced in unison.To further slow the arrival of cases, ministers said Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday, when they will join South Africa and five other neighbouring nations on UK red lists.Mr Javid told Times Radio it is planned that the new regulations will be laid in Parliament on Monday, with MPs expected to be given a vote within  days and after they come into force.A number of backbench Tories may stage a rebellion, but it is thought unlikely Labour would oppose the restrictions, virtually guaranteeing that they will pass.The UK, Germany and Italy all confirmed the presence of Omicron on Saturday after the iant first detected in South Africa was reported to be in Belgium a day earlier.Experts hope existing vaccines will still be good at reducing serious disease from Omicron, but manufacturers are looking at tweaks to make them more specic to the iant..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Masks toon Tuesday but families told
