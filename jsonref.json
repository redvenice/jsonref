Dr Emanuel said the plant has \u0027unique growing characteristics based on its flower, on the smell, on the flavor, even on the euphoria\u0027 it delivers to those who consume it         The species of cannabis was all but destroyed by America\u0027s war on drugs in the 1980s because it was so easy to spot, due to its height But in the 1980s, during the US war on drugs, landrace cannabis was easily spotted because of its height and destroyed, and cultivation of the plant was abandoned. Over time, easier-to-hide hybrids replaced the landrace cultivars.          Landrace cannabis had been the favourite of Bob Marley (pictured), Peter Tosh and Bunny WailersDr Emanuel has grown cannabis since 2001, moving to Jamaica in 2007 to pursue his studies. The 35-year-old from Dominique has a doctorate in biology, with a specialty in horticulture and the adaptation of plants to climate.A lover of marijuana himself - which he doesn\u0027t smoke but rather consumes by means of vaporization or aromatherapy - Dr Emanuel decided to recover the lost landrace varieties and reproduce them in his lab.The quest wasn\u0027t easy: grains of landrace had spread to the four corners of the Caribbean over the years. His search led him to Guadeloupe, Trinidad and Dominique, in pursuit of Rastas living in the countryside and still cultivating what is left of these plants.Dr Emanuel recalls finding a Rasta man living on a mountain who \u0027hadn\u0027t been really been in contact with the civilization in the last 40 years. \u0027It was a six hours hike to get to him,\u0027 he said.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Recently had one of those brilliant moments that any literature loving parent will treasure. My youngest son, 16, expressed an interest in what’s on my book shelves, and asked for some recommendations. Where to start? Anywhere excited, energised and thrilled.I read On The Road straight through one hot summer night when I was 16. I finished the last few pages as the early blue morning arrived gently. And I was changed. The book had an amazing effect on me, and I dedicated the next few years of my life to travelling, experiencing, writing, being, and living what I thought life was all about to the absolute maximum.I’ve read it a few times again over the last 30 years, and my attitude to it has changed considerably. I’m aware now that it was always out of time and out of step a book popular in the 60s, written in the 50s about the 40s. I came to it in the 80s. There are still breathtaking passages of sparkling writing, wonderful imagery and a unique energy and beat. But Dean Moriarty is no longer a hero, and a bit of life experience showed me how callow, false, duplicitous and selfish he was - dying a drugged up death on the railroad before middle age - a dismal end to a life of taking everything and giving nothing. And Sal Paradise was an observer, hanging around and only ever half taking part. Kerouac, himself, died at 47, after years of bitter alcoholism and living with his mother.I still think it’s one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and my changing attitude and reaction to it and its story won’t diminish that greatness. I’ll be fascinated to learn what my 21st century boy makes of it.We’ll be fascinated to hear about it here too. Elsewhere, 25aubrey has just finished William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist:Never thought I’d say this, but every page is as good as every scene in the movie. Powerfully gripping, one of those rare books that become welded to your finger tips.“Voluptuousness rampant” now, as vermontlogger reports on Zola’s Nana:It’s a highly coloured story of voluptuousness rampant, hurricanes of extravagance, and unhesitating deception all round, with not one honest character, except at moments Nana herself - superbe fille, superbly realized - who is at least forthright about her desires. The writing seems to be freer than in earlier volumes, less drawn from notes, as if it came more easily to him to imagine conversations in the louche world of theatre types and demi-mondaines. This being Zola, there are some very dark passages too, including the final great tableau which neatly ties up a number of story lines amid the noise and alarums of approaching war.“I read Superior: the return of Race Science by Angela Saini in one sitting yesterday,” says gavernism:I was in turns worried, educated, and fascinated by it. Saini takes you step by step through the history of eugenics and phrenology. She shows the worrisome return of certain theories from the late 19th century that seem to be revivified by a cross current of factors. It’s a real thought provoker and I would like to recommend everyone read it, if only to see if you agree with me that it is clearly a timely and possibly timeless book.The “sensational” Lady Audley’s Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon has impressed SydneyH:The author is often paired with Wilkie Collins, but in style and content this novel is a match with The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Dickens. I think the text is often noted for its plot, but what is probably under-acknowledged is that the prose is gorgeous. I don’t want to say too much, because it is a mystery after all, but this is the best book I’ve read so far this year.Mann’s attention to detail is microscopic, not only does he take you on a voyage into the human history of history a family’s life, but the circumstances in which it lives - right down to the design of the upholstery of the furniture. You may think this rather dense stuff, but once you get all these details, you get drawn into the fabulous world which Mann depicts.Finally, let’s hand it over to Besonders who has written an extraordinary summary of War And Peace:This book is very similar to Pride And Prejudice, if Jane Austen had written Pride And Prejudice for an Eastenders storyline, with all the characters belonging to high society, fretting about Brexit, and if all of Europe and its neighbours were trying to settle Brexit by battles between their armies and coalitions of armies.The novel is ided into five books, each book ided into three or four parts, each part ided into chapters of two or three pages. My copy is 1212 pages long, not including the epilogues.Book three, part one, chapter seven ends with “And then the war began…” Literally “…” – like a sequel is in production. In my copy that’s on page 672.Book three, part two, chapter 29 ends with “The first shots”. That’s on page 845.That’s 173 pages between the war beginning and the first shots. (Well, the first shots that are part of the novel’s action). And all 173 pages are brilliant.Fantastic. Makes it sound like the book isn’t long enough…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog. Happy reading!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622cca1b4ca2867e062c47044f688dc9b555b4fc/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea943cac2ff728a31c250264286738c","title":"the guardian view on the peterborough byelection a populist backlash","story":"Mainstream parties need to offer narratives, and policies, that address the underlying economic grievances of votersPeterborough is a smallish city in eastern England with a fast-growing population of European migrants attracted by its factories, warehouses and agricultural work. On the edge of the Fens, it sits on top of two faultlines in British politics: those of culture and class. When the city voted to leave the European Union in 2016, it seemed to be reacting against the ethos of the times – against immigration, against ersity, against pluralism. But less than 12 months later, in the general election, Jeremy Corbyn’s leftwing Labour party won in Peterborough. Despite Ukip pulling out to avoid splitting the rightwing vote in 2017, Stewart Jackson, the pro-Brexit Conservative MP, lost his seat.With recent history as a guide, it might seem that when elections in places like Peterborough are fought on the territory of identity, the battle favours the right when the contest is about economics, then progressives find the going easier. If that is the case, then both the main parties, so badly bruised by last month’s European polls, have much to fear this week in Peterborough – not least as the byelection only came about because the former Labour MP, Fiona Onasanya, was removed by a recall petition after being jailed for lying about a speeding offence. With Britain’s future relationship with the EU still unresolved, Nigel Farage’s rightwing populist Brexit party looks set to mop up.The question is how to re-enfranchise this group of voters with an economic programme rather than one that revolves around cultural identities. Liam Byrne, the Labour MP who wants to be mayor of the West Midlands, suggests Peterborough was susceptible to exiting the EU because it was hit hard by the twin shocks of globalisation and austerity. He thinks the regions must be able to retool their economies with appropriate fiscal powers.Mr Byrne is right. Peterborough’s most successful period was in the 20 years until 1988, when it was run by a new town corporation with extensive powers to attract inward investment and population, largely from London. It created a strong local private sector which has since withered. A Cambridge University study last year calculated that if Peterborough had maintained the economic momentum that it enjoyed during its two decades as a “new town”, it would have had around 27,000 extra jobs by 2015.At the heart of the populist backlash is people’s feeling that they are losing ground, not because they have been dealt a poor hand in life, but because the rules were unfair and others – bankers, large companies, foreigners – are taking advantage of a rigged playing field. What may look like a xenophobic reaction might have its roots in economic dislocations. What matters is that politicians offer a narrative and policies that frame success as an economic rather than a cultural phenomenon. That unfortunately seems an unlikely prospect this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61e080514b8721e9d9de9fc4261655fd065e3bf/0_104_5296_3179/master/5296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9431a80bc084559a6511abf9794f417","title":"latest data shows steep rises in co2 for seventh year","story":"Readings from Hawaii observatory bring threshold of 450ppm closer sooner than had been anticipatedThe concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by the second highest annual rise in the past six decades, according to new data.Atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gas were 414.8 parts per million in May, which was 3.5ppm higher than the same time last year, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, where carbon dioxide has been monitored continuously since 1958.Scientists have warned for more than a decade that concentrations of more than 450ppm risk triggering extreme weather events and temperature rises as high as 2C, beyond which the effects of global heating are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.May is the most significant month for global carbon dioxide concentrations because it is the peak value for the year, before the growth of vegetation in the northern hemisphere starts to absorb the gas from the air. The seasonal peak and fall can be seen in the Keeling curve, named after Charles Keeling, who started the observations on Mauna Loa because of its isolation in the Pacific Ocean.This is the seventh consecutive year in which steep increases in ppm have been recorded, well above the previous average, and the fifth year since the 400ppm threshold was breached in 2014. In 2016, the highest annual jump in the series so far was recorded, from 404.1 in 2015 to 407.66 in 2016.As recently as the 1990s, the average annual growth rate was about 1.5ppm, but in the past decade that has accelerated to 2.2ppm, and is now even higher. This brings the threshold of 450ppm closer sooner than had been anticipated. Concentrations of the gas have increased every year, reflecting our burning of fossil fuels.Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institute, and the son of Charles, said: “The CO2 growth rate is still very high – the increase from last May was well above the average for the past decade.” He pointed to the mild El Niño conditions experienced this year as a possible factor.Tuesday’s findings come from Mauna Loa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has also made complementary independent measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations since the 1970s. NOAA’s Barrow observatory on Alaska’s North Slope showed an average of 417.4ppm over the period, but the Arctic typically has higher CO2 readings than the Mauna Loa series.Pieter Tans, a senior scientist at NOAA, said: “It is critically important to have these accurate long-term measurements of CO2 in order to understand how quickly fossil fuels are changing our climate. These are measurements of the real atmosphere, and do not depend on any models, but they help us verify climate model projections, which if anything have underestimated the rapid pace of climate change being observed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dc30892c424d0fe8a15cdcc24f015b3edfe2482/0_102_3690_2214/master/3690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=320240717ed20ee8fbb5371c56109f4d","title":"teen activists face us government in crucial hearing over climate trial","story":"The suit accuses the federal government of violating young people’s constitutional rights by contributing to the climate crisisTwenty-one youth activists faced off with the US government in an Oregon courthouse on Tuesday, where their attorneys petitioned a panel of judges to let their climate case go to trial. Until it does, their attorneys will also argue, fossil fuel development should be halted on public lands.The case of Juliana v the US charges the federal government with violating the constitutional rights of youth by perpetuating systems that contribute to climate breakdown. Those young people – who range in age from 11 to 23 and hail from all corners of the nation – argue that the constitution gives them and future generations a right to an environment free of climate catastrophe.Their previously scheduled trial was abruptly halted in October 2018 after the government successfully petitioned the supreme court for review. Now, a three-judge panel at the ninth circuit has the final say.The panel was not expected to issue a ruling on Tuesday.The courthouse and its surrounding area in Portland, Oregon, were bustling with activity for Tuesday’s hearing. The courtroom was packed with plaintiffs, parents, observers and press. Big screens were set up to broadcast a livestream of the hearing in the nearby park.“I think what’s at stake is the ability of these young people to vindicate their constitutional rights,” said plaintiff attorney Andrea Rodgers, senior staff attorney for Our Children’s Trust, the not-for-profit group representing the youth plaintiffs, ahead of the hearing. The key determination ahead, essentially, is whether kids get a trial over climate breakdown.Those stakes and the government’s handling of the case have catapulted it to rare courtroom celebrity. The youth plaintiffs are media regulars, with seemingly ubiquitous appeal: teen magazines, local newspapers, radio shows and recent appearances on 60 Minutes and in Vanity Fair. Hearings have been a spectacle, regularly mobbed by suit-and-tie types, kids of all ages, tie-dye and purple-haired grannies. More than 70 support rallies were held worldwide in lieu of a trial last fall.The digital following is no less a curiosity. The youth climate movement has begun to claim Juliana as central to its own narrative, using support rallies to train young leaders and to turn up the digital volume on the case with hashtags like #AllEyesOnJuliana. Tuesday’s hearing will be livestreamed and also broadcast into a park in Portland, Oregon. More than 1,000 supporters are expected to gather. Seventeen of the plaintiffs plan to attend and rally crowds after the hearing.Jeffrey Bossert Clark argued against the trial on the government’s behalf. A former George W Bush administration appointee, he has publicly equated greenhouse gas regulation with socialist attempts to seize the economy and use of United Nations science as synonymous with US rule by foreign scientists.Clark argued on Tuesday that the suit is a direct attack on the separations of powers, and that the young activists wrongly want the courts, instead of elected officials, to direct things such as energy policy.Julia Olsen, a lawyer for the activists, argued federal energy policy “puts children in harm’s way”. Olsen also stressed courts can and have intervened when government actions violate the Constitutional rights of citizens.Bloggers, legal experts, scholars and activists have puzzled over the government’s overall tactics to the case. In legal circles, the case is an anomaly, made an outlier by the repetitive, emergency petitions filed to squash it. That strategy has been repeated in cases on the far-right fringe of Donald Trump’s agenda: cases affecting Daca recipients, immigrants and the national census, and the transgender military ban.The questions raised in the case, however, are increasingly pressing in America, and worldwide. While the UN counted hundreds of climate cases worldwide in 2017, and more than 650 in America, the question as to whether greenhouse gas emissions violate constitutional rights is being pressed primarily by Our Children’s Trust and its partners. The organization has filed legal action in all 50 states with varying results - litigation is still pending in 9 states (Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington). Similar efforts to uphold constitutional rights to a safe environment are also underway in 13 countries abroad. In the Netherlands, such litigation may soon force the Dutch government to take more measures against climate change in a case now headed to the Dutch supreme court. The supreme court of Pakistan and an appellate court in Norway will also hear similar cases soon.The US government has not disputed that climate breakdown is real, or that an environmental crisis looms. In fact, government experts generally agree with the plaintiffs’ experts on the science. Government attorneys have instead argued that the court does not have the legal authority to tell the federal government what to do about climate change, and that a trial would be too burdensome. They have also argued that Americans don’t have a right to “a climate capable of sustaining human life”.That position is one 17-year-old Nick Venner, a plaintiff in the case, called, “kind of ironic because this case is the only way to get it done because every other effort has failed, essentially”. He said the government’s attorneys “really like to keep it in this theoretical phase because, when they do that, they can deny the humanity of the issues that they are dealing with”. Most at issue, he said, are climate policies that are “going to drastically screw over future generations”.Those generations have sought to be heard. More than 30,000 youth signed an amicus brief filed by Zero Hour in support of the plaintiffs petition to move the case to trial. An additional 10,000 adults also signed.“I don’t want to be picking these fights. The youth don’t want to be picking these fights. And, honestly, it’s exhausting to be in the streets all the time,” said Zero Hour’s executive director, Jamie Margolin, who is 17. She added she doesn’t see another choice when other efforts have failed. “Our childhoods are being spent begging them to stop ruining our adulthoods, and our adulthoods are going to be spent dealing with the consequences of their actions,” she said.A decision to allow a trial and halt fossil fuel development in the meantime would stall production of 60 new oil and gas pipelines, 32 new liquefied natural gas and coal terminals, and one oil export facility.The Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd03ee708cf3011facae81ff9dff1389e91d1509/0_295_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd00a1a475dc26ccca88d77eee58c0f","title":"max mara showcases in neues with berlin inspired collection","story":"Neues museum catwalk show also paid homage to Marlene Dietrich’s gender fluidity  Women over 40, once invisible in the fashion world, are taking centre stage. The German singer Ute Lemper, 55, and the model and ocean conservation activist Carolyn Murphy, 44, were the stars of a Max Mara catwalk show at the Neues museum in Berlin on Monday evening. They continue a trend for indomitable older women headlining fashion’s most glamorous events, in which Diana Ross, 75, has performed at Christian Dior’s recent gala show and Stevie Nicks, 71, sang with Harry Styles at a Gucci event in Rome last week.Max Mara, the quiet giant of Italian fashion with an annual turnover of €1.5bn (£1.3bn), has always dressed professional adult women rather than It girls what has changed is that this identity is no longer a barrier to being a seriously glamorous player in the industry. “Everyone in fashion talks about empowerment now, but in Max Mara’s case it is hardwired in. Max Mara was founded in the 1950s with a clear idea of dressing a new class of women who would be going into the workplace,” the British designer Ian Griffiths said after the show.But Griffiths, who has helmed the brand for three decades, views the vogue for empowerment as a fashion buzzword as problematic. “I think brands like ours need to be very careful because I’m now realising that the progress that has been made in gender equality is so much more fragile than we thought. So if you say that your clothes are about empowerment, you must produce clothes that genuinely are empowering. The message of these clothes is about a woman who is determined to succeed and to overcome wearing clothes in which she will be taken seriously.”Muse for this collection was native Berliner Marlene Dietrich, courageous in a gender fluidity that was decades ahead of her time. Dietrich flouted convention, without forfeiting either status or adoration. “She wore a man’s suit in the 1930s, but she was still one of the most highly paid actresses in the world,” said Griffiths. With sharply tailored trouser suits and ice-white satin blouses, the collection also nodded to David Bowie. “As an art school boy in Manchester in the 1980s, Berlin was everything, and when we thought of Berlin, we thought of Bowie.”The logic for a splashy out-of-season show is that the Max Mara bottom line depends on coats. The collections now shown with great fanfare in May and June, known as “resort” and “cruise”, arrive on shop floors in November. So despite their archaic names, which are anchored in a bygone age of winter holidays, they are perfect for showcasing coats.The show was the first to be staged in the Neues museum, which stood derelict for 60 years after being bombed in the second world war before being reconstructed by the British architect David Chipperfield.The camel coats – Max Mara’s signature – were softened to a chalky sandstone to compliment the wide double staircase in the museum’s central hall, which formed the first part of the catwalk. The models all wore flat shoes, to better navigate the stairs with confidence – except Ute Lemper, who at her own insistence wore tall spike heels under her wide-legged trouser suit.Max Mara made headlines last year when Nancy Pelosi wore a red Max Mara coat, which she had previously worn for Barack Obama’s second inauguration, for a key standoff with President Trump. “I like to think that she chose to wear that coat because it means something to her emotionally,” commented Griffiths. “I hope that it gave her a psychological boost, which is what clothes can do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78d4f970d6068f273d2bfdca18ec7f9bf49bc26/0_423_5520_3314/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798c9f1b519b95af2f6793fac4b8b00a","title":"bon appetit how i rediscoved the joys of french cuisine","story":"Like many Britons, Felicity Cloake lost her passion for steak frites and creme brulee when more exotic options appeared – so she embarked on a tour of France to find it. Plus: five recipes that fanned the flameI can measure out my childhood in creme brulee. Every special occasion in the early 90s was celebrated with a trip to the same Soho brasserie in London for onion soup and steak frites, always culminating in the same pièce de résistance, a little pot of custard with an eminently smashable sugar top. In the summer, we would go over on the ferry and eat the same thing at the source, to a Johnny Hallyday soundtrack.In this, we were part of a fine British tradition. Long before Elizabeth David shook up domestic cuisine with French Country Cooking in 1951, 19th-century cookbooks were peppered with recipes “in the French fashion”, while the continental restaurants of Soho and Fitzrovia in London were a magnet for Victorian artists and bohemians.Yet although French food has maintained its traditional status at the top of the tree – think of a fancy restaurant and I bet your mind conjures an image straight out of Ratatouille – our passion has been cooling since the turn of the millennium.It was the pesto I noticed first, a sludgy green interloper in the door of the fridge at home, the vanguard of an Italian invasion that would eventually see the Naked Chef cosy up to Keith Floyd on the kitchen bookshelf, and the butter dish on the dinner table replaced by extra virgin olive oil (which, my dad’s anxious face suggested, was expensive stuff, not to be wasted on teenagers).It wasn’t only Italian food elbowing the French stuff out of the picture. Suddenly, every pub did Thai or Tex-Mex next to fiery green curries and technicolour chimichangas, all that solid, bourgeois cooking started to look very vieux chapeau. Who wanted to sit demurely spreading chilly pate on toast when you could eat chilli-spiked nachos with your hands, or tear into a gourmet pizza topped with rocket and parma ham?The food writer Diana Henry remembers the moment well: “I was cooking out of Raymond Blanc and loving French bistro food and then it all changed.” She attributes this partially to the influence of places such as the River Café, but also to a collective move away from the cream- and butter-heavy school of French cooking historically popular in this country in favour of lighter, sunnier flavours.At university, free at last to choose for myself, I too rebelled, scorning the creme brulee on offer at the local branch of Pierre Victoire in favour of a Japanese restaurant called Edamame, where I saved up for weeks to nibble bright-green soya beans straight from the pod. Needless to say, this – and the raw fish that followed – blew my tiny mind, just as the accompanying wasabi blew my sinuses. French food felt beige and bland in comparison. Familiarity breeds contempt, however unfair that may be.Nostalgia eventually saw me crawl back into its buttery embrace, however. Last year, I decided to write a book – One More Croissant for the Road – just so I could spend the summer cycling around France in the name of “research”, the latest in a long line of Britons hopelessly smitten by French culinary savoir-faire.But those six weeks pedalling around l’Hexagone made it clear that I wasn’t that familiar with French cuisine after all. For one thing, it took a while to re-adjust my palate – so thoroughly acclimatised to hot sauce and kimchi, anchovies and miso – to the quieter, subtler pleasures of the provincial restaurant menu, characterised from Brittany to Burgundy by fish in white sauce with stewed green beans (I don’t think I even tasted garlic on my trip – I mean really tasted it – until I reached Marseille).Then there were the myriad hyperlocal specialities I had never even heard of, such as spicy tomato macaroni with braised beef and sausage in Sète on the south coast, or the creamy deep-fried tripe eaten with relish in Lyon. These are now as much a part of my mental image of French food as old friends such as the moules marinières or cherry clafoutis below. New discoveries were as thrilling as the classics were comforting – I thought I was au fait with French food, when I had barely scratched the surface.I am home again now and happily reunited with my collection of chilli oils. Fortunately for my further education, though, I am not the only one with a renewed appetite for French flavours: Olive magazine tipped new-wave French as a trend to watch in 2019, a prediction borne out by restaurant openings including Flamboree!, an Alsatian tarte flambée joint on Old Street in east London Bob Bob Cité, which serves up steak tartare and snails in parsley butter a mile away in Leadenhall and La Guingette, a little piece of Paris in Bristol. Bistrotheque, in Bethnal Green, east London, is due to open a Manchester outpost later this summer.With French food firmly back on the British menu, this feels like the right time to get back in the kitchen and remind ourselves why we fell in love with it in the first place.For all its carefully cultivated mystique, the world’s most famous omelette is surprisingly easy to reproduce – it just takes a bit of elbow grease (or an electric whisk). I haven’t suggested any fillings, as adding extra ingredients to the pan will knock the air out of the eggs, but a few chopped herbs on top are very welcome. You can serve fried potatoes, cured ham, sautéed mushrooms or foie gras, if you must, on the side.Per omelette3 eggsA pinch of saltOil, to greaseGenerous 1 tbsp cold butter, cut into small diceCrack the eggs into a large bowl with the salt and begin whisking vigorously. Once they are fairly foamy, oil a heavy-based frying pan, about 20cm (8in) wide, and put it on a medium heat.Keep whisking the eggs until they are very thick and bubbly, almost like a mousse. This will probably take just under four minutes with a hand whisk.Pour the mixture into the pan and leave to set until it begins to come away from the side of the pan, then gently loosen the edges with a spatula and slide the butter underneath, shaking to distribute it evenly beneath the omelette.Once it is deep golden underneath, but still foamy and wet above, carefully shake the omelette on to a plate, fold it over and serve immediately.Such a simple dish, but such a delicious one, with the added theatre of the shelling operation, of which I never tire. I like to use Norman cider and drink the rest with it, but you can use a dry white wine if you prefer. Chunks of baguette or (or preferably and) hot, salty fries to mop up the liquid are, however, mandatory.Serves 21kg mussels4 long shallots, finely chopped300ml dry cider or white wine, eg Muscadet50g creme fraicheA small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely choppedBaguette or chips, to serve (or both)Rinse the mussels in cold running water, then give them a good scrub and scrape to remove any barnacles or dirt. Discard any with broken shells and give any open ones a sharp tap if they don’t close, throw them away, too. Pull out the beards – the fibrous appendages with which the mussels attach themselves to ropes or rocks – by pulling them sharply towards the hinge end of the mussel. If you want to prep them ahead, leave them in a sink of cold water until ready to cook.Put the chopped shallots and the cider or wine into a large pan and cook gently for 10 minutes, then turn up the heat to medium-high.Drain the mussels and tip into the pan. Cover and cook until most of them have opened – about three minutes.Add the creme fraiche and put the lid back on for 30 seconds to allow it to melt. Add the parsley and shake the pan well to distribute, then season gently and serve immediately, discarding any mussels that remain closed.Most of the ingredients for this bistro classic are readily available, although you may have to go to a greengrocer’s for a frisée lettuce. (Other bitter leaves, such as chicory, or the traditional dandelion greens, would also work well. At a pinch, you could use a crunchy mixed salad.) Leave out the lardons if you would prefer to keep it vegetarian– fry a finely chopped shallot at that stage instead, to flavour the vinaigrette.Serves 4½ a slim baguette (ficelle, if you can get it)Olive oil, to drizzle1 garlic clove, cut in half150g smoked bacon lardons1 tbsp dijon mustard2 tbsp red wine vinegar4 eggs2 heads of frisée lettucecurly ene, washed and dried well (see above)Preheat the oven to 200C180C fangas mark 6 and cut the bread into thin slices.

Divide between four bowls and top each with a poached egg.This dish is the star turn of Gascon cuisine, an apologetically rich gratin of beans and animal fat, studded with various meats and served hotter than the southern sun. The great food writer Richard Olney called it “a voluptuous monument to rustic tradition”.Serves 81kg haricot beans, soaked in cold water overnight1 onion, peeled and halved1 large carrot, cut into chunks1 head of garlic, unpeeled, plus 4 cloves2 sprigs of thyme2 sprigs of parsley1 bay leaf1kg slab of pork belly, bone in4 confit duck legs and their fat (reserve any jelly you find in the tin)6 Toulouse sausages300ml white wineSalt, to seasonDrain the beans well and put them into a very large, ovenproof casserole dish. Pour in water until it comes about 3cm above the top of the beans, then add the onion, carrot, whole head of garlic, herbs and pork belly (if you need to spoon out some water at this point, that is OK – you can top the dish up during cooking). Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for about two hours until the beans are just tender, but not falling apart.Meanwhile, fry the duck and sausages separately in plenty of the duck fat until crisp and golden.Once the beans are ready, remove the onion and herbs and discard. Scoop out the pork belly and, once cool enough to handle, cut into chunks, discarding the bones.Squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins and mash to a paste with 4 tablespoons of duck fat and the fresh garlic cloves. Preheat the oven to 160C140C fangas mark 3.Drain the beans, reserving the liquid and seasoning it well – this will be your sauce. Grease the bottom of the casserole with a little of the duck fat mix, then tip in the beans, the rest of the duck fat and all the meat, plus any jelly from the duck confit. Mix well, then top with the wine and the bean cooking liquid to cover.Bake for about 2 hours, keeping an eye on it – once a crust has formed, stir this back into the cassoulet, repeating as necessary. By the end of the cooking time, you should have a thick, golden crust.Allow to cool slightly before serving with a simply dressed green salad.This is the creamy, chunky version that you will find in Limousin bakeries, rather than the crisp clafoutis served hot for dessert in restaurants and after dinner. Sturdy and surprisingly portable, it is a good choice for a picnic at the height of cherry season, although make sure you warn people to watch out for stones. Leaving them in may seem like the height of laziness, but in fact it adds to the fruit’s flavour, as well as making life considerably easier for the cook. (The use of demerara sugar is a tip from the food writer Sarah Beattie, who lives in the south-west of France.)Serves 6-8Butter, to grease3 tbsp demerara sugar600g cherries4 eggs100g caster sugarA pinch of salt100g plain flour500ml whipping cream150ml milkA dash of vanilla extract50ml rum or brandyGrease a deep roasting dish about 25 x 20cm (10in x 8in) wide with butter and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Preheat the oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4.Remove the stalks from the cherries, but don’t bother to stone them unless you are feeling very energetic. Put them in the base of the dish – they should cover it in a single layer. Eat any extra cherries.Whisk together the eggs, caster sugar and salt, then whisk in the flour until smooth, followed by the cream and milk. Finally, stir in the vanilla and rum or brandy.Pour on top of the cherries, carefully put into the hot oven and bake for 50 to 65 minutes until firm on top with a slight wobble in the middle.Allow to cool to warm before serving – although it is also very good cold.One More Croissant for the Road by Felicity Cloake is published by Mudlark.

That has sharpened ball skills and control in confined areas, techniques honed at their clubs, and preserved energy levels. There have also been tweaks and switches in formation over the past year aimed at maintaining progress.“We were happy with the World Cup but it is not enough. Even if we had won the World Cup, it wouldn’t have been enough. We would have to have gone again because the rest are doing more to catch up. So we still have work to do. We made some adjustments immediately, switching tactically from a back three to a back four, but it is that never-ending search for perfection, frankly.“I had seven years at Chelsea working for seven different high-level coaches: four had managed Real Madrid or won the Champions League. That is the challenge. It is no good English coaches, myself or Gareth included, crying about the lack of this or the lack of that. It is the way it is and the challenge is to pick the best from the best and work as hard as possible to create our own opportunities.”Holland, much admired by influential figures in the Chelsea hierarchy, has seen English coaches make breakthroughs into the top flight in recent times which, on the back of the national team’s success in Russia and en route to the Nations League finals, will have encouraged compatriots seeking to make their mark in the elite. Chris Wilder, Dean Smith and Graham Potter will manage in the Premier League next term, with Scott Parker installed at relegated Fulham and Frank Lampard having gone close to promotion with Derby. Steven Gerrard is a year into his managerial career at Rangers.“When everyone has had enough of me and Gareth, the options for the next guy are, firstly, significant and, secondly, all English. For many years now our reputation abroad has not been great for whatever reason – whether as players or coaches – and, frankly, we are very passionate about changing that perception at the highest level. We have outstanding coaches in this country at youth and senior levels who deserve a little more respect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0658fffbd717f1daa58f89a15bcd3c5da10fc6b2/1134_532_3840_2305/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16528d640e3ef34d379ba3fb93615162","title":"wifi woes why do we accept poor service","story":"How many times have you sat down after a long day to relax with the latest episode of your favourite TV show only to be met with a frozen screen? And yet so many of us accept bad service as par for the courseWhen the beautifully curved, extra-high-res screen of your beloved mobile glints up at you from the bottom of the toilet, you reconsider the life choices that have brought you to this point …The choice to leave buying gig tickets until the last minute, for instance. Or the choice to do it on your phone while brushing your teeth. Or, worst of all, the decision to put off fixing the wifi for another week.It’s incredible how much our lives now hinge on technology, and yet it’s also incredible how much of it just doesn’t work properly. Imagine impressing your ancestors with a magic device that allows you to talk to anyone on the planet face-to-face, and then trying to explain why the video call drops every five minutes. Ogg the caveman might not have been able to Google things with his rudimentary tools, but at least they were reliable.It’s baffling how much incompetent technology we put up with when we really don’t need to. If you fell down a huge pothole in your driveway, you’d get it repaired, right? So why do we just shrug our shoulders and accept gaping wifi blackspots in our homes?One of the big reasons is that when something works a bit, it’s a lot easier to ignore the problem than if it breaks entirely. If the wifi is completely down, that’s priority number one and we won’t rest until it’s sorted, but if it still works as long as you stand on one leg in a particular area of the kitchen – well, you can just watch your cute puppy videos there.Come to think of it, why doesn’t wifi simply work anywhere in the house? Why must we contort ourselves into undignified positions in inconveniently located corners of our homes just to send a tweet? According to Neil Illingworth, head of innovation at Virgin Media, the root of this tech problem is – you guessed it – other technology.“Large metal objects, such as refrigerators, mirrors or TVs can block or reflect the wifi signals, leading to slow speed,” Illingworth explains. “Did you know that a microwave oven operates on some of the same frequencies as wifi? Their power is about 10,000 times higher, and safely contained within the shielded oven, but a small amount can leak out. It’s not dangerous, but it can have an adverse effect on wifi.”Let’s face it, we’re all a bit embarrassed to admit we don’t necessarily know what magic words we’re supposed to whisper in the router’s ear to improve the wifi signal. And even if you can make slight improvements by moving the router around, unless you know where the blackspots are, you’re still stabbing in the dark. What if that’s the best we can get for the money?We’re constantly being told how advanced tech is now, and how we practically live in the future, so why can’t the wifi just grow some artificial intelligence (AI) and fix itself?Actually, it can. Virgin Media’s Intelligent WiFi isn’t just a name – it’s a way of setting up your home network so the system itself can detect moments of interference and sort them out. It knows how many people and gadgets are using your wifi, and adapts itself automatically so the things that need the most data get a better connection (um, hello Netflix marathon).Intelligent WiFi works with the Virgin Media Connect app and the Hub 3 to scan your whole network constantly for things that can be improved.It can also handle the really technical stuff, such as working out if something’s interfering with the signal – and then switch frequencies to avoid it.Of course, some wifi problems can’t be fixed with smarts alone – there’s always that one person whose house naturally has blackspots. If it’s you, stop affectionately calling your home “The Void” and plug in a wifi booster – they’re free on some plans.The fact is, there are approximately 10 bajillion more fun things to do with wifi than search for ways to fix it, so try Intelligent WiFi and let the AI revolution do something for you – even if it’s just doubling the speed of the “tickets have sold out” page. It might be intelligent, but it’s not a magician.Looking for faster connectivity? Or just fed up of losing connection halfway through your favourite TV series?

Writer Sarah Pyper shares some handy tips and the best apps to help you stay on top of everythingLike 4.2m others in the UK – and a further 1.8m who’d like to – I often work from home. Once a euphemism for staying in bed and watching hours of daytime TV, working from home is now an everyday occurrence for those developing businesses, working flexible hours around the care of loved ones, or just avoiding spending time jammed into the armpits of their fellow commuters. All you need is a laptop, a reliable wifi connection and you’re set.But if you don’t have reliable wifi, it doesn’t matter how organised you are, how snazzy your tech is, or which shiny new game you’ve got to occupy your kids with, it will all fall apart. Thick walls, mirrors and even windows can create wifi blackspots that turn your home-working dream into a nightmare. However, Virgin Media’s new Intelligent WiFi with Hub 3, WiFi boosters and Connect app can be relied on to save the day. While the Intelligent WiFi system is designed to deliver the best wifi signal across your home, the Connect app also allows you to pause specific devices – which comes in particularly handy when you need to put the kids to bed.As someone who juggles writing and editing with social media side projects and caring for two children, my home isn’t just my castle, it’s my office, my gym, my laundry and my sanctuary – so I rely on home tech and some key apps to get it all done.Digital helpWith digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, you can delegate domestic tasks while you work. They can turn up your heating, adjust the lighting using smart bulbs, feed your pet with devices such as Feed and go Smart Pet Feeder, or control a video doorbell such as Nest Hello so you don’t have to get up to see who’s interrupting you. If it’s time for a break, your smart kettle can start making a cuppa, while your smart toaster warms a slice. Even better, you can link your assistant to a robot vacuum cleaner such as Roomba to clean your carpet, or iRobot Braava, which will mop your floor, meaning you can ace your deadlines and complete your chores at the same time.Keep the kids occupiedA bored child trying to join in your conference call, especially at a tricky moment, has the potential to shatter that illusion of professionalism you’ve been carefully cultivating– just ask Prof Robert Kelly, whose four-year-old daughter interrupted a live TV interview with BBC News. My deadlines and reputation have often been saved by a well-timed gaming app for the kids. Minecraft is a long-time family favourite where you can build entire worlds, and Roblox sees the kids connecting with their friends in a bid to run a pizza parlour, adopt a baby or take care of a pet kitten. If emergency strikes, relinquish your phone and let them take selfies with special effects filters until you’re done. Works every single time.Seek inspirationWhen I need to feel more productive, I listen to the How I Built This podcast’s interviews with successful business owners such as Bobbi Brown for inspiration. Or, for a quick energy boost, the 7 Minute Workout app gets you moving with a set of 30-second exercises. If all else fails, ask Siri to play an upbeat playlist on Spotify at top volume, and thank your lucky stars you’re not in a communal office.Beat the working-from-home bluesThe downsides of working at home can be the domestic distractions (the kettle needs descaling) and feeling isolated (there are only so many conversations you can have with the cat). If things get a little quiet, I switch on Coffitivity or Noisli, which provide background noise so you can pretend you’re strolling through woodland or a Parisian street while you sort out your accounts. To avoid procrastination, I turn to Forest or Tomato Timer. Plant a virtual tree on Forest and it will grow – but only as long as you focus on your work and don’t check any other apps. Tomato Timer helps you follow the Pomodoro Technique where you work intensely for 25 minutes then take a five-minute break when you’ve finished your task.Looking for faster connectivity?

It could just be sweat, thoughLook at the hellish picture above these words. It looks as if someone has made a baby drink plutonium. It’s not nice, is it? You’re looking at the snappily named Light Therapy Golden Facial Treatment Device from MZ Skin. A golden facial sounds quite the off-menu request, but this is a big deal in dermatology circles, an at-home version of the LED phototherapy beloved of celebrities. I struggle to reconcile its voguish credentials with the gape-mouthed horror before me.The machine is dull gold with a brown headstrap and is quite, quite chilling. It looks like one of the masks with which Mayans decorated their dead, to face a long battle in the underworld. What a mouthwatering prospect.Inside, it is even stranger, with 150 numbered LEDs arranged grid-like on a face-hugging sheet, encased within the chunky frame. Surely it won’t work. It has a plastic signal box and many wires, and it looks as if someone has grafted the face of Thomas the Tank Engine on to a potato waffle. But where wellness goes, we go. I strap it on. Press the buttons. Wait to ascend to Xibalba, to meet the God of the Corn.Appearances can be deceptive. Of all the stuff this column has looked at, LED phototherapy so far claims the most scientific validity. It was developed to assist pain management and wound healing, after researchers noted the surprising effects of certain lights on skin. The idea is that, at specific wavelengths, photon energy is transferred into cells, activating changes to their collagen production, inflammation response and pigmentation. The evidence points most clearly to benefits around scar healing, as well as acne vulgaris, rosacea, and herpes simplex and zoster. (Oddly appealing names.) But there is more limited evidence that phototherapy may combat wrinkles, brighten skin and generally give you a youthful glow. Early experiments prompted hair regrowth on a rat’s back or something, and since then the dermatological industries have been desperate for us to give it a go.I don’t have a great time inside the mask. I have a small, pea-shaped head and the headset is heavy and large, with only one adjustable strap, so the entire thing feels as if it is hanging off my eyes. I later test it in front of friends, who confirm the look as “very Leatherface” (from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Teeth visible. Eyelids inside the eyeholes, forced closed and sad. It gets more upsetting when I turn the lights on with the wired controller. One can choose between five colours and adjust their intensity, and the timer function goes up to an hour. Yellow light is meant to reduce redness. White, near infra-red light, repairs the dermis. Blue is supposed to be good for clarifying the skin, and also making it look as if you are in a sordid mashup of Eyes Wide Shut and Tron.“Immediately post-treatment, the skin appears perfect, youthful and radiant,” the blurb says. I can’t say that’s true. I endure the mask for 20 minutes, avoiding all mirrors. Immediately post-treatment, I look … exactly the same. I do have a glow, but this is from the light sheen of sweat on my brow and cheeks. Or is it fear?To experience the full benefits, you are meant to do this for half an hour, several times a week. I do a few more sessions, trying different lights, but eventually get bored. Even if the golden facial works as miraculously as claimed, is it worth the discomfort? Or having to spend hours resembling a budget horror villain on his way to meet a Mesoamerican maize deity? It is not. Plus, it costs £385. You could buy a cheap washing machine and an expensive pub lunch for that, and still have change for the bus home. It is hard to say whether or not light therapy is a magic cure. Those with specific skin conditions, or sensitivity to other types of facial, should probably try a clinic session first. Everyone else, take a look at yourselves. If this is the alternative, better to just accept the ageing. I never thought I’d say that. In that sense, it has been a very effective therapy. Sorry again for the picture.Mz Skin’s products boast a plethora of celebrity fans, including Selma Blair, Princess Charlene of Monaco, Jess Glynne and Donna Air.

But when I pointed this out, the furious reaction revealed the strength of ‘married is best’ prejudiceAt the Hay festival late last month, I gave a talk about my new book, Happy Ever After, which discusses happiness data surrounding relationships. My conclusion – that single women might be healthier and happier than married women and married women with children – was met with surprise from many, delight from single women and shock and even outrage from other quarters, especially on social media. Many pointed to their own experience to criticise me, saying that they – or their wives – were happier now that they were married or parents than they were when they were single. One man tweeted photos of his wife as apparent proof. I was accused of spreading propaganda. “How far will the media push this ‘independent woman’ narrative?” was one popular tweet.It is true that there is lots of variation across people, and people are obviously not randomly allocated to marriage – so we cannot know for sure the causal effects of marriage on health and happiness. There is some pretty robust evidence, though, that single people are more likely to foster social connections that bring them fulfilment, whereas married people often find themselves with less consciously chosen social networks, such as a spouse’s family members. Single people are also more likely to volunteer and to participate in social events. By contrast, married and cohabiting iniduals tend to become more socially isolated, even without the excuse of children. The longitudinal nature of these data suggests this relationship is causal, with those entering marriage more likely to lose existing connections than those who do not marry. Social connectedness is linked to happiness – so this might go a long way towards explaining why single people aren’t as miserable as many people would imagine (and, it seems, sometimes even hope) them to be.There is more evidence, but it can never provide a definitive answer on how any of us should live our lives. Instead it is more useful to focus on why so many people seemed to take the suggestion that single women are doing just fine without men and children so personally and so badly. It certainly appears that the “married is best” narrative remains pervasive.A study in Israel (where there are relatively strong ideals around marriage) asked people to look at comparable biographical accounts of both married and single people (invented by the researchers) and then to rate the extent to which they displayed several traits. Most people assumed the married folk scored higher on traits relating to happiness than the “depressive”, “lonely” and “shy” singletons. No matter how single people were described and what great things they had experienced and achieved, people were insistent that their happiness must have been overstated.What is particularly interesting about this study is that the researchers also varied whether or not the single people profiled had chosen their relationship status. Counterintuitively, those who had chosen to be single received lower positive trait ratings than those who would have preferred to be married, even though the former group was living the life they had wanted. It’s as though the choice to be single is too great a societal affront to be sincere – it must be a provocation.Discrimination against single people also rears its ugly head in professional contexts. Married people generally get first dibs on holiday times, and are the last to be asked to relocate offices. Employers often assume that single people are more time-rich than married people, and expect them to put in more hours and effort relative to their married counterparts, the assumption being that they have no other meaningful commitments and are therefore less likely to be put out – so single people work harder and are not rewarded for it.Outside work, the discrimination continues. Singles are excluded from a host of “couple-specific” deals on insurance, hotels, gym memberships, banks accounts and mortgage payments. Laws and other regulations discriminate against singles further. The UK’s marriage allowance, for example, allows one half of a married couple to transfer £1,250 of his or her personal tax allowance to their spouse, cutting their annual tax bill by up to £250.Our insistence on advocating committed relationships through marriage may be caused in part by a desire to defend overarching power structures, such as government, political frameworks and religion. These represent codes and practices that bring a sense of reliability and familiarity to our lives. Anything that might be perceived as what psychologists refer to as a “system threat” can cause us to feel uneasy, and to spring to the defence of the systems that we consider to be working in our favour.In one study from Canada, male participants who were primed to feel that society was suffering economically, politically and socially compared with other countries defended committed relationships much more than the men in a control group. But the same results did not hold for women. In general, men have more to gain than women from existing power structures and systems – such is the nature of gender inequality – so it is not surprising that they defend these systems, including marriage, more vehemently when they are perceived to be under threat.The idea that it is marriage or bust ignores not only inidual differences but also the many ways in which we can find fulfilment in and out of relationships. If we are to start to tackle the narrative trap of marriage, employers must ensure that any flexible working policy is available to everyone, no matter their personal circumstances. There are good libertarian and egalitarian grounds for the state to stop incentivising marriage, such as by removing the tax breaks for married people. The legal system also needs to rethink how it favours married people. If anything, singledom and singletons should be celebrated, especially when wider social benefits are accounted for. Singles have more time to devote to meaningful activities that can benefit society, and they leave more of their money to charity in their wills.Each of us as iniduals can start by caring less about what kinds of relationships other people choose to have, and how they live their lives. If they are not harming us, why should it matter? Perhaps we do see them as a threat to the hierarchies and presumed order in society. Or perhaps we are a bit jealous of them having apparently freed themselves from social convention. Or it might be that we cannot resist making comparisons with our own lives when we hear about how happy other people are: if they are happy, then I must necessarily be less so, as if happiness were a zero-sum game. Whatever the reasons, the key message is that we need to become much more accepting of the myriad ways in which different people can be differently happy. In so doing, we could all become a little happier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cec4521d03b7178f6aee65a20088776bb4a2b01/0_0_6366_3820/master/6366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b4557fc009bbba7b33bda6ebcabd46b","title":"why parents are addicted to calpol","story":"Calpol is only one brand of liquid paracetamol – but the sweet, viscous, strawberry-flavoured syrup in the purple box is as much a part of childcare as nappies, wipes, dummies and bottles. Babies learn to recognise that syringe well before they know how to use a spoon, and they anticipate it: their sticky fingers reach to put it further into their mouths.This drug is found in found in bedrooms, bathrooms, nurseries and creches. Kitchen drawers across the country are littered with used Calpol syringes. There are more than 12,000 search results for Calpol on the talkboards of the British parenting website Mumsnet. But the more Calpol has become synonymous with parenting, the more its ubiquity has begun to worry us.Over the past decade or so there has been a succession of panics over Calpol. Could it be behind the explosion in childhood asthma? Could its signature colourings and flavourings be the mysterious cause of the epidemic of ADHD? Worries over Calpol’s purported sedative properties have filled the pages of countless parenting forums.Last year, a BBC documentary about overmedicated children set off another flurry of panic. After reporting that children swallow three times as many drugs as they did 40 years ago, the film-makers interviewed a family GP whose brief remarks filled the pages of tabloids and the sofas of daytime TV for the better part of a week. “We have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol,” the GP said. “Some people describe it as the heroin of childhood.”Like all paracetamol products, Calpol eases pain and lowers fever, but we give it to babies who are too young to tell us what is wrong with them in the hope it will soothe them. For many, Calpol is a panacea, a cure for baby-crying, a reliable way to settle your child and send them off to sleep. At a time when we are being forced to recognise the dangers of so many everyday items, from plastics to bacon to toilet seats, we fear that the ubiquitous solution in the brown glass bottle must have some kind of dark side. In short, Calpol makes us feel guilty. It has become a soft target for an anxiety exploited by scaremongers and conspiracy theorists. But British parents cannot live without it.The medicine of British childhood is actually produced in a vast factory in a suburb of Orléans. Calpol is now owned by an American company, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, who have outsourced manufacturing to a French company called Famar. In their marketing, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson like to remind us of how Calpol has been a go-to solution for generations of British parents, but the company only acquired the brand in 2006, and don’t have much information about its history. They have never given an interview about Calpol before: pharmaceutical companies don’t really do press junkets.After several months of emails about Calpol, they invited me to their British headquarters in Maidenhead, where the receptionists wear the company colours – white shirts with red neckerchiefs – as if they were stewardesses on a Johnson \u0026amp Johnson airline.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson call the Calpol range of medicines The Calpol Family. “From stuffy noses and sore throats to aches and pains, fevers and teething,” the brand’s website promises, “we’ve carefully developed a family of effective medicines to help you take great care of your little one” – as if describing a crack team of solutions to almost any health problem the average child will encounter.“It’s a brand that we’re really proud of,” Purvi Farahi, the head of marketing for Northern Europe told me. She sat with Gill Nelson, the medical director for Northern Europe, in a white boardroom with red chairs on the other side of the table was a PR consultant who was taking notes and recording every word of our conversation. “For over 50 years, it’s a brand that parents, grandparents and caregivers have grown up with. At the heart of it, I think it’s really about trust.”Trust in the Calpol brand is the reason people choose it over cheaper alternatives: parents are buying “the experience of the overall product”, Nelson told me. “When you’ve got a poorly child and you really want to make them feel better, it’s not really a time when you want to start browsing the shelves.”Dr Andrew Green, a GP in Yorkshire and the British Medical Association’s GP committee clinical and prescribing lead, took a dimmer view of our collective loyalty to the Calpol brand: “In our society we have the idea that expensive things are best,” he told me after my trip to Maidenhead. “Buying the expensive one that’s the familiar one with the nice bottle and the advertising means parents are doing the best for their child.”Calpol’s formula is as central to its success as its familiarity. “The active ingredient is paracetamol, but the other ingredients – what we call the excipients of the product, all the other bits and pieces that are put in to make sure it doesn’t go off in the bottle, has the right consistency, can be extruded into a syringe for dosing, tastes acceptable and looks acceptable to children – all those are unique to Calpol,” Nelson explained, deftly avoiding the words “colouring”, “preservatives”, “flavourings” and “sweeteners”. Calpol has 2.2g of sucrose per 5ml, which is more than four times as much sugar as there is in an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola. No wonder children can’t get enough of it.Prof Mahendra Patel, a pharmacist and board member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told me that Calpol’s tasty formula has made all medicines more palatable for children. “Calpol educates that baby to say, actually, I will have that medicine, I won’t spit it out. In terms of any medication the child takes thereafter, the seed has been sown that medicines aren’t bad.”You don’t have to go to a pharmacy to buy Calpol: it’s sold in petrol stations, newsagents, corner shops and supermarkets. If you can get a pint of milk, you can probably buy a bottle of Calpol alongside it. “Availability is really important, particularly for a medicine of this type where it often is a purchase that you’re making in a really stressful situation,” Nelson said. This doesn’t quite ring true to me: I have never waited until my children were ill before buying some. Indeed, the NHS website says it’s “a good idea” to keep children’s paracetamol always stored at home.Patel has witnessed the power of the brand first-hand. He began his career working in areas that were densely populated with recent migrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. “Families with small children were coming through the pharmacy and they didn’t speak the language, but because Calpol was Calpol it didn’t need any translation: they knew it was the solution to many of their children’s minor problems.”The nurses who run immunisation clinics routinely tell parents to give their babies paracetamol to avoid adverse reactions, particularly after the meningitis B vaccination, which has a more powerful inflammatory response, was recommended for all infants in 2015. When my baby was immunised last year, the nurse explicitly told me to “go and buy some Calpol” to give her afterwards. This means many first-time parents’ first encounter with children’s medicine is a healthcare professional telling them to use it before their child is ill, setting up a relationship whereby we give it before we’re sure it’s needed.Under the watchful eye of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Calpol has managed to produce marketing messages that promise what every parent wants to hear. One recent advertising slogan is “Lets Kids be Kids”, and TV adverts emphasise how Calpol can “help them get back to normal”. A Calpol booklet offering an immunisation guide for parents depicts a blissed-out baby asleep with her arms outstretched and a smile on her face. Sick children don’t have a role to play in Calpol’s marketing strategy: the messages emphasise the emotional rather than medical reasons for giving the medicine. By focusing on the positives, they give the impression that Calpol can cure your child’s discomfort, no matter what the reason for it might be.When I put this to Farahi, she told me this was intentional. “The strategy for us is always to show the end benefit that parents are looking for,” she said. But their marketing strategy is about more than being back to normal: it’s about portraying children who have had Calpol as being happy, or asleep, or both.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson hold competitions every few years to find the new face of Calpol – a coveted role in marketing and packaging, on par with being the Pears or Gerber baby. More than 24,000 parents entered their children into a “Be a Calpol Star” competition on the brand’s Facebook page in 2011. When two year-old Millie Foster became “the Calpol Kid” in 2006, which meant her face appearing on the box, her mother, Georgina, was ecstatic. “Everyone will have her in their cupboards now. Her granny and grandpa are very proud,” Georgina told her local paper, the Surrey Comet, but added that Millie actually “doesn’t like her photo being taken at all”.In the 18th and 19th centuries, mothers rubbed paregoric – a waxy tincture containing opium – into their babies’ gums to soothe teething pain. As late as the mid-20th century, it was common to do the same with whisky or brandy, and “gripe water” containing alcohol, sugar, dill extract and baking soda was given routinely for colic. In the 1950s Gould’s gripe water was advertised with strapline “No more fuss from baby”.Even though paracetamol is the most common medicine in paediatrics, no one is entirely sure how it works. We know it inhibits an enzyme involved in producing prostaglandins, making the body less aware of pain, but the mechanism by which it acts on the brain to reduce fever is less understood. We know the inputs and the outputs, but it’s a black box.Paracetamol was discovered after a mistake at the University of Strasburg in the 1880s. Professor Adolf Kussmaul was experimenting with naphthalene, the main ingredient of mothballs, as a possible cure for intestinal parasites. His patients were accidentally given acetanilide instead, and while it wasn’t much good for worms, it dramatically lowered fever. Acetanilide was cheap and effective, but it also deactivated some of the haemoglobin in red blood cells, with potentially lethal results. Paracetamol, a derivate of acetanilide, was first used in clinical trials by the German pharmacologist Joseph von Mering in 1893, but fears lingered that it might still be dangerous, and it was only after a series of studies in the 1940s showed paracetamol to have no effect on haemoglobin that it began to be widely sold.Calpol was launched in 1959 by Calmic Limited, based in Crewe. (It’s likely the Calpol brand name comes from the contraction of “Calmic” and “paracetamol”.) At the time, paracetamol was being given to children in solution and tasted extremely bitter Calmic was the first to suspend it in a sweet, flavoured syrup. When Calmic was bought by Wellcome in 1966, aspirin was going out of fashion as a painkiller because it had been linked to gastro-intestinal bleeding. Wellcome marketed Calpol as “Better and safer than aspirin because it is a non-irritant”. It was prescription-only at this point, but prescription medicines could be legally advertised until 1978. One of the first print adverts for Calpol reads: “Calpol Suspension is a flavoured liquid – very pleasant to take from a spoon. As you know, this can be a great help when your child is ill or upset.” It sold parents calmness, just as it does today.Calpol’s advertising slogans of the mid-70s (“Simple answers to everyday babycare problems”, “Gentle and comforting, pleasant tasting too”) positioned it as more than a medicine: a comfort for your child, a solution for you. One late-70s slogan, “Pleasant for baby, peaceful for you”, is the closest the brand has ever come to explicitly claiming Calpol has the ability to make crying babies shut up. The sentiment was echoed in an animated television advert in the 1980s featuring a grumpy, grizzly baby. “There are times when every baby is just crying out for Calpol infant suspension,” the mellow voiceover says, as the child’s frazzled parents stand over his cot in their pyjamas pouring it into a spoon. “It makes everyone feel better.”By the 1980s, Calpol could be bought from pharmacies without a prescription, and it became one of Wellcome’s best-selling products in the UK, with more than a million bottles sold over the counter in 1983. Babies began to be given Calpol routinely after vaccinations. Calpol was now such a normal part of British parenting that it was being marketed as something you pack in your suitcase when you go abroad. “When the family go on holiday don’t take the risk of aches and pains,” read a 1980s print advert, next to a cartoon of a feverish child on a beach. Discomfort had become something a “concerned parent” shouldn’t want to risk.When British parents began to worry about sugar and additives, sugar-free Calpol was launched in 1988, and a colour-free version arrived a few years later. When we became obsessed with 24-hour convenience in the late 1990s, Calpol switched from being a pharmacy-only medicine to one sold in any store. Since acquiring the brand in 2006, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson have expanded the Calpol “family”, launching a version that was both sugar-free and colour-free in 2011, and adding a saline nasal spray and a plug-in vapouriser that releases chamomile and lavender essential oils supposed to assist sleep after all, this is a brand that parents have long associated with sleeping children.The link between Calpol and sleep has been discussed in countless Mumsnet threads since the site launched in 2000. In one entitled “Dosed on Calpol – feeling guilty”, a mother tortures herself for giving her six-month-old a dose purely to make him drop off. Other parents weigh in to reassure her. “Calpol wont send him to sleep. he was obviously in discomfort with paintemp somewhere, and the calpol worked,” one says. “I just assumed that it was slightly sedative,” the mother replies. “I guess you can’t use it forever though so where do you draw the line?”In 2007 Johnson \u0026amp Johnson introduced a new product: Calpol Night, for children aged two years and up, with added antihistamine, to explicitly aid sleep. But in 2009 the MHRA ruled that 36 different medicines, including Calpol Night, should no longer be given to children under six: research had shown them to be of limited use in younger children, and linked them to side effects such as disturbed sleep and hallucinations. Even though Johnson \u0026amp Johnson could have continued to market it for older children, Calpol Night was quietly withdrawn in 2010.Doing the very best for your children today means not ever allowing them to suffer. But the generation of parents who are increasingly unwilling to leave their children to cry at night are the same parents who are prepared to dose them up with a nightcap of paracetamol and antihistamines to make them sleep.Prescriptions for ADHD medication have doubled in the past decade, and prescriptions of adult sleep medication given to children have increased tenfold over the same period. But because Calpol is such a ubiquitous part of everyday parenting, every anxiety over children’s medicines seems to be projected on to Calpol.The fame of Calpol is so great that it was even dragged into the investigation of Madeleine McCann’s disappearance in 2007. The Portuguese police were under pressure to come up with new leads, and their attention briefly turned to whether Madeleine’s parents, who were doctors, had accidentally killed her while trying to sedate her. Leaks from the investigation appeared in a Portuguese newspaper, claiming an oral dosing syringe had been found in their holiday apartment. The McCanns readily admitted that they occasionally gave their children Calpol, but strongly denied administering anything stronger. There was no basis whatsoever for the theory, which has been completely discredited. But still the Calpol detail was seized on by conspiracy theorists and tabloids alike: the combination of the nation’s most famous missing child and our best-loved children’s medicine was too sensational to resist, even though the most basic research would show that Calpol contains no sedative ingredients at all.Many of the subsequent panics have been similarly fact-free. “Babies given Calpol just once a month ‘are five times as likely to develop asthma’” declared a headline in the Daily Mail in 2013. The Mail was only one of many newspapers to dramatically misreport the results of a study of 20,000 Spanish children: Calpol isn’t even sold in Spain the study measured paracetamol use alongside asthma symptoms, but failed to find a causal link. The NHS issued a response debunking the reports, but the story still gets repeated in newspapers today.When a campaign group called later that year for food colourings linked to hyperactivity to be removed from children’s medicines – all children’s medicines – the press brought up Calpol’s signature purple hue: the headline in the Times read “Hyperactivity link to additives in Calpol”. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson said in an email that they use colourants – including “Sunset Yellow” and “Carmoisine”, which were linked to hyperactivity, though only with much higher doses than are found in Calpol – “to make the medicine look more visually appealing to poorly children who otherwise might refuse the dose”, adding that “the majority of children will experience no ill effects from consuming the tiny amounts of colourants in Calpol”. Of course, you could just buy the colour-free version – but the original purple formula remains the best-seller.But it was the GP’s offhand remark about Calpol as the “heroin of childhood” that caused the greatest flurry in the British tabloids. In 2018, a BBC series called The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs looked into whether we are overmedicating our children. The presenter, Dr Chris Van Tulleken, took his baby daughter to be vaccinated and then interviewed his family GP. “We have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol. I don’t think they are addicted to the drug itself, but they are addicted to the process,” the GP said. “Some people describe it as the heroin of childhood.”The image of the Calpol-junkie baby was too powerful to leave room for nuance. Parents left angry messages on Calpol’s Facebook page after the broadcast. “My children are teenagers now but I’ve learned things tonight that I never questioned before – I feel like I’ve been misinformed during their formative years,” said one. “Anybody working for this organisation needs to have more integrity,” said another, “speaking as a concerned mum.”But Chris Steele, doctor-in-residence on ITV’s This Morning programme, issued a robust defence of the brand on air. “Every parent will be thankful for the paracetamol Calpol syrup,” he said. “It’s not addictive. However, parents, I think, are psychologically dependent on Calpol, because when their children are ill they do go for the Calpol. Well, that’s all right, so long as you follow the recommended dosage. It’s totally safe.”Calpol is very safe if given according to the instructions on the pack. (The only real danger is an accidental overdose, and these are very rare.) But our dependence on it makes us uneasy, which is why the scare stories refuse to die. As both scaremongers and marketing departments know, parental concern is a lucrative seam to mine.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson reject the idea that parents are giving their children too much Calpol. “We don’t have any evidence that it’s overused,” Nelson said, and Farahi cited independent research data to back this up: “On average, households purchase 1.95, so say around two bottles a year of Calpol,” she told me. “Usually there’s about 1.75 kids in a family, roughly two.” One bottle per child per year doesn’t sound like much, but an average figure takes in families of children of all ages, and, as any parent knows, Calpol is used more frequently with babies than with older kids.As much as paracetamol is a black box, so are babies: they are non-verbal, their internal states are opaque, and we have to work out what’s wrong with them when they are upset. “There seems to be a default action to give it to a distressed child, whether or not that child has a temperature or fever,” Dr Andrew Green told me. This happens at the other end of the age spectrum, he said. “Where you have an adult with dementia who is distressed, then it’s a quite reasonable therapeutic intervention to try some regular low-risk medication like paracetamol, because sometimes people can’t communicate pain. I wouldn’t in any way criticise parents for giving it to distressed children. There are rational reasons for doing it.”Calpol’s packaging says it is for the relief of pain and fever, but we give it for distress, and the brand has always encouraged this in its marketing. There are many reasons why a drug containing no known sedatives might make a child calm and sleepy. The most obvious is that it alleviates the pain or physical discomfort from fever that was preventing them from sleeping. But it is likely Calpol’s power derives primarily from its ability to comfort parents.“One of the things that determines the distress in the child is the distress in the parent. Children and babies are extremely good at picking up anxiety,” Green told me, describing how babies at immunisation clinics are always more upset by the injection when their parents are fretting. “It’s upsetting for parents to have an ill child, and natural for parents to want to help that ill child. Giving the child medicine is a way of helping. The act of giving the Calpol assumes far more importance than the mere giving of a medicine: it’s an expression of love, and it reduces tension. It’s almost a placebo effect by proxy: the child benefits from the parent believing that they’re doing good.”We are dependent on Calpol – but it is parents, not kids, who are addicted. It is understandable that a medicine could come to take such a central role in family life. Parents are increasingly atomised, separated from wider networks of extended families and community that used to pass wisdom down. When there is a problem with our children, we are as likely to reach for Google as to ask a friend. Calpol has stepped into that void, producing booklet guides to immunisations, and online advice on teething, earache, colds, flu and many more common minor health problems. The Calpol website hosts several information videos featuring groups of mums sharing a pot of tea with a GP around a wooden kitchen island, comparing notes about how to recognise a fever, the flu or a new tooth. The site gets over more than a million hits a year.But by turning to Calpol whenever our child is distressed, we contribute to an already rampant culture where problems are supposed to be solved by medication. “We can forget, in all stages of our lives, the non-drug interventions that are effective, the simple things that we can do,” Green said. “Every time a GP does an emergency or a turn-up-on-the-day type of surgery, we will get an embarrassed mum in with a child who is running around the room giggling. They will say, ‘I brought him here because he’s really ill with a temperature, but he’s got better.’ The reason they’ve got better is that they are in an environment that is interesting, and they’ve had a ride in the car or bus or pushchair and cooled off a little bit.”Johnson \u0026amp Johnson insist the wider Calpol range, with its nasal spray and vapour plug, offers non-drug alternatives for those who want them. But perhaps it would be more useful to look at this the other way round: it’s not so much that we believe the answer to our children’s discomfort is drugs, but that we don’t view Calpol as a drug. It has infiltrated our daily lives and most protected spaces. It is part of solving our babies’ problems in the same way as a dummy, a cuddle or a nappy change is. Many are as likely to reach for Calpol as they are to rock their babies when they are very upset.Some of this is due to clever marketing, which, over decades, has established the brand as a “simple answer”, an “everyday” part of having kids. Some of this comes from its ubiquity – the fact that it can be bought at the same time as we buy our loaf of bread or fill the car up with petrol. Calpol has become the brand of medicine that we don’t regard as a drug, no matter what its manufacturers might print on the pack. That is the secret of its success.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bfe4b1c3e9853bf7d53ac53d2811e008f215d38/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=11b58bf1c2a498286f7c8bd81bcfe707 2020w","title":"neil woodford fund manager","story":"The top stock-picker manages billions – but admits ‘you will get things wrong’Neil Woodford was once the UK’s biggest star fund manager, personally managing a £25bn mountain of money on behalf of pension funds and other investors at Invesco Perpetual.When Woodford, now 59, decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry, with many experts predicting investors would withdraw huge sums from Invesco to follow their man.The editor of financial news service Citywire, Gavin Lumsden, tweeted: “Invesco must be wetting themselves. Neil Woodford setting up a new fund manager.”Patrick Connolly of financial advisers Chase de Vere said it would be “impossible for Invesco Perpetual to replace Woodford with somebody of similar standing because, particularly in the world of UK equity income funds, there is nobody of similar standing”.At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK’s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE’s attempted £28bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment “hero” and fund management “star”, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century at Invesco Perpetual. A £1,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to £23,000 by the time he left.Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn’t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother’s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn’t pass the RAF’s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford.Woodford scrapped performance bonuses for his staff – which in fund management can stretch above £10m a year to top performers – insisting they were “largely ineffective” and can lead to “wrong behaviours”. Instead, he gave them all a big pay rise.When questioned about the performance of his funds over recent years, Woodford has been very defensive. Asked by the Financial Times in December 2017 if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford replied: “Daily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying ‘everybody go away, I’m right, I’m right, I’m right’. You’ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.”Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. “You have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn’t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd95d53d2b2909eccd912fa1f021c2a498aaa243/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45c0e7ca82424acd5f605bbdf52f2d2c","title":"best albums of 2019 so far","story":"Ariana Grande delivered swaggering pop, there was state-of-the-nation rap from Slowthai, Dave and Sleaford Mods, Billie Eilish shouted out for the teens, and Angélique Kidjo blended Africa with Cubaby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesAnchored by sturdy, stunningly pretty folk-rock backings, Adrianne Lenker, her voice tremulous but tenacious, makes existential musings amid verdant nature.What we said: “Full of subtle charm, it’s an album of deceptive depths in which to immerse yourself.” Read the full reviewThe Californian troubadour, who has steadily wound his way through the fringes of Americana and indie for over 15 years, delivers another romantic, faintly psychedelic masterpiece.What we said: “McCombs rewards deep listening.

In their statement, they said they would embark on a “nationwide programme of deliberative democracy”, across the UK.“Change UK doesn’t just belong to MPs. It belongs to the country and those looking for a sense of hope and leadership to genuinely change our politics,” the five said in a statement.“We are in it for the long haul,” Leslie said. “It was never going to be easy to challenge the established parties. Of course there’s a whole treacle of cynicism that gets poured on people who try to do something different.”He said the MPs had agreed that Soubry, who has been a leading figure in the People’s Vote campaign was “absolutely the clearest voice” in the “Brexit maelstrom” – and that they did not want to waste crucial weeks selecting a leader, like the Conservative party.Soubry said she was “deeply disappointed” that colleagues had resigned. “Now is not the time to walk away, but instead to roll up our sleeves and stand up for the sensible mainstream centre ground which is unrepresented in British politics today,” she said.Several of the MPs who have quit the party are believed to be considering defecting to the resurgent Liberal Democrats, although they issued a statement saying that they would initially sit as a group of independents.Allen and Umunna have both been advocating closer cooperation with Vince Cable’s party. Some of their erstwhile colleagues suspect they may have been offered plum seats, or the backing of Lib Dem activists in their existing constituency, if they defect.The other four MPs to quit the party were Luciana Berger, who fronted its slick press launch on London’s South Bank in February, Gavin Shuker, who had spent months drawing up secret plans for the breakaway group, Sarah Wollaston and Angela Smith.Change UK, which was initially called the Independent Group, caused a stir in Westminster when it was launched four months ago after the defection of seven Labour MPs. It had hoped to become the catalyst for a major political realignment, attracting a string of other recruits and becoming the rallying point for remainers.High-profile candidates including the former Conservative minister Stephen Dorrell, and the journalists Rachel Johnson and Gavin Esler, joined the party’s list of prospective MEPs.However, it has been beset by internal disagreements over strategy and management, including how closely to cooperate with other parties.Change UK’s leading candidate to become an MEP in Scotland, David MacDonald, stepped aside from the race and recommended voting for the Lib Dems. Two other candidates resigned after offensive social media posts were uncovered.Even before the European election polling day, Johnson questioned its strategy, saying: “If I were running it, we would have one leader and a different name and we would have done a deal with all the other remain parties. Then we would be able to give the Brexit party a fight.”Shortly after the party forms, former Labour MP Angela Smith is heavily criticised for referring to people from minority backgrounds as having a funny tingeAfter renaming itself Change UK, the party gets into a row with petition site Change.org, who release a statement warning it will be seeking guidance over the imitation of its brandTwo election candidates are forced to resign within 24 hours of each other after offensive tweets emerge, including Joseph Russo, the party\u0027s top Scotland candidate, writing \u0027black women scare me\u0027Lead Scottish candidate defects to the Lib Dems a week before European electionsMP Joan Ryan implores the audience at the party\u0027s Bath rally to look at their palms: \u0027It\u0027s there, the future is in your hands\u0027In the week before the European parliamentary elections it emerges that Change UK spent £87,000 on Facebook adverts, becoming the\u0026nbspbiggest single political advertiser on Facebook - including spending at least £1,300 promoting Facebook adverts saying it was campaigning to \u0027remain in the UK\u0027Six of Change UK’s 11 MPs, including its spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspand interim leader Heidi Allen, abandon the fledgling party. Former Conservative business minister and anti-Brexit campaigner Anna Soubry becomes leader.Allen, the South Cambridgeshire MP, was appointed interim leader, but Umunna was still widely regarded as Change UK’s public face. Allen admitted she had considered resigning in the run-up to the European elections. She had suggested voting tactically for the Lib Dems in that poll, a proposal Soubry later called “rather bizarre”.Soubry and Umunna had struck up a close political friendship as co-chairs of the cross-party group on EU relations, which coordinated the tabling of anti-Brexit amendments in parliament.But the pair clashed over Change UK’s future direction, with Soubry determined that it should continue as a political party, while Umunna became convinced it could only survive by striking up a close alliance with the Lib Dems.Umunna published a statement on his website on Tuesday, saying he had differed with colleagues over the party’s direction.“While I believe it should carry on as an organisation, I do not believe Change UK should carry on in its current form. This has put me in a fundamentally different place not only to other Change UK parliamentary colleagues but also its activists and candidates who should be free to take the party in the direction they wish,” he said.He added that he planned to sit as an independent in parliament, “for the time being”.With Cable stepping aside, frontrunners for the Lib Dem leadership, Ed Davey and Jo Swinson, have suggested they would welcome new recruits.Swinson said: “As the European and local election results showed, the old, two-party politics is fracturing. The Liberal Democrats are at the heart of the fight against nationalism and populism and I want to lead this party to grow that movement.”Davey, who had been more sceptical about the idea of an electoral pact with the breakaway group, said: “Change UK’s swift demise shows that my reluctance from the beginning to discuss mergers and pacts, and to hold firm in our belief that the Liberal Democrats are the clear home for all who want to stop Brexit, was the right call.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5906bc4b0ad4594c00e00f119954790f73722ff/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c47c9fb6eb6e00ccef1f3eaeca7ad2a","title":"tory leadership candidates likely to need eight backers","story":"New 1922 Committee rules aim to speed up race prior to showdown between top two The Conservatives are speeding up their leadership contest to set up a battle between two big name candidates within the next fortnight, with Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt most likely to make the final cut.Announcing the rule changes, the party said candidates must declare at least eight nominations from fellow Conservative MPs by Monday in a move that will knock out some of the lesser known hopefuls.As she announced on 24 May, Theresa May will step down formally as Conservative leader on Friday although she will remain in place as prime minister until her successor is chosen.The rules for the contest to replace her have been tweaked by the backbench 1922 Committee, with the backing of the party’s board, in order to prevent the contest dragging on for weeks.Nominations will close at 5.30pm next Monday. Candidates will have to show that they have the support of eight of their colleagues: a proposer, a seconder and six other MPs.MPs will hold a series of votes, in order to narrow down the crowded field, which currently stands at eleven leadership hopefuls.How does the voting work?MPs choose one candidate, in a secret ballot held in a committee room in the House of Commons. The votes are tallied and the results announced on the same day.The 1922 Committee has decided that after the first round, any candidate who wins the support of less than 17 MPs, will be eliminated. And after the second round, the threshold will be set at 33 MPs.Rounds of voting will then continue until just two candidates remain. The first round will be held on Thursday 13 June from 10am to noon. Subsequent rounds have been pencilled in for the 18th, 19th and 20th.The two remaining candidates will then be put to the Conservative membership for a vote.When will the results be announced?Once MPs have whittled down the field to two, Conservative party HQ takes over the running of the next stage, which it says will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22 July.Will there be hustings?Yes: MPs have organised a series of events themselves to put the candidates through their paces, kicking off with an event convened by the One Nation group on Tuesday evening. Conservative party HQ will organise its own events and the BBC has also announced several televised debates between the candidates.Subsequent rounds will knock out the candidates with the least votes until a shortlist of two is left, in a process likely to take just two weeks with a final round of voting on 20 June.About 160,000 Conservative members will then cast their ballots on which of the two will be the next prime minister, with an announcement in the week beginning July 22.The new rules from the 1922 Committee benefit the more established candidates who have already built up support, with Johnson currently totalling almost 40 public endorsements from MPs. Gove and Hunt have about 30 public supporters each.There were at one stage 13 candidates who had declared they wanted to succeed Theresa May, with more expected to enter the race in the coming days, but two ministers, Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly, withdrew on Tuesday acknowledging they did not have enough support to make the final two.Malthouse said: “The last few days have demonstrated that there is an appetite for this contest to be over quickly and for the nation to have a new leader in place as soon as possible.”Under the new structure, Rory Stewart, Mark Harper, Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom, and Sam Gyimah are the most vulnerable of the remaining contenders to falling out at the first round.Some MPs had raised concerns about the number of hopefuls and time it would take to pick two leading candidates, but others are concerned that narrowing the field too fast could lead to a hasty decision without the views of the frontrunners being sufficiently tested.Under the previous rules, MPs would have cast rounds of votes with the least popular candidate dropping out until the number was reduced to the shortlist of two.With Johnson out in front, the race appears to be on for the second place on the ballot, with Gove and Hunt the most likely candidates.Hunt will launch a campaign website and video on Wednesday, after having gained the unexpected backing of Liam Fox, the trade secretary, on Tuesday.Fox, one of the cabinet’s most dedicated Brexiters, surprised some other leadership camps with his endorsement of Hunt, who has said pursuing no deal would be “political suicide” because it would lead to a general election.Over the weekend, Johnson won the coveted endorsement of Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who had been touted to run herself, as well as that of the sacked former defence secretary Gavin Williamson.Mel Stride, the new leader of the House of Commons, is a backer of Gove, while Javid, the home secretary, won the support of the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, on Tuesday.David Gauke, the justice secretary, who has repeatedly cautioned against a no-deal Brexit, has endorsed Stewart, the international development secretary who was formerly a junior minister in his department.Stewart, who has ruled out pursuing a no-deal Brexit, has attracted media attention for his campaign, which has been based on social media videos of him meeting the public at short-notice events around the country.Several high-profile cabinet names are yet to declare who they will back, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, who has been one of the most vocal cabinet voices against leaving the EU without an agreement.Rudd’s 60-strong group of One Nation Conservative MPs will hold the first of three hustings on Tuesday night for Tory candidates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5cbe4027aa0883825cdde8f0daec11231aa1b34/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a39db6fc46ca1b1cf459404c935806b","title":"tory leadership contenders whos up whos down replace theresa may","story":"With Theresa May stepping down as Conservative leader, who is jostling to enter No 10?With Theresa May having announced her resignation, you can barely move in Westminster without bumping into a minister making a “wide-ranging” speech spelling out their merits and political philosophy. Here are the candidates who have said they are definitely running and others who may enter the fray in the coming days.He has been relatively quiet recently, beyond his regular  column, but this is very deliberate.Few things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged with this image awash with tasteful pastel hues. He formally launched his bid in the Mail on Sunday.Among the more core constituency of Conservative MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official “Ready for Raab” Twitter feed.The environment secretary is to pitch himself as a “unity candidate” capable of attracting leavers and remainers, as he formally declared his candidacy saying: “I believe that I’m ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist party, ready to deliver Brexit and ready to lead this great country.”But robust Brexiters in particular dislike the fact that he stayed loyal even in the final days of the crumbling May regime.The former House of Commons leader, who left Theresa May as the last candidate standing when she pulled out of the previous leadership race in 2016, has decided to have another tilt at the top job, saying she has the “experience and confidence” to “lead this country into a brighter future”.But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider.Fears that the foreign secretary would be another overly woolly compromise choice were hardly assuaged when after a set-piece speech he seemed unable to outline why his brand of Conservatism might appeal to voters.The health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on, the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of being apparently competent and broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one.The cabinet’s most recent arrival – Penny Mordaunt’s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary – certainly has the necessary ambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan.He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism.The former work and pensions secretary, who quit last year over May’s Brexit plans, has launched her own in-party campaign groupleadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism.It promises to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as erting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police.The home secretary still has the same weaknesses: he is an uninspiring speaker and some worry he is too fond of headline-grabbing, illiberal political gestures. But he is almost as ubiquitous as Liz Truss, and clearly believes this is his time.He even has a grassrootsastroturf Twitter feed – “Avid4Javid”.The housing minister is credited as the convener of both Conservative leavers and remainers to develop a compromise on May’s withdrawal agreement. He said there was a “yearning for change”.The 52-year-old is a former deputy mayor of London and entered the Commons in 2015 when David Cameron’s Conservatives won a majority.His name was given to the “Malthouse compromise” – a proposal drawn up by backbenchers from leave and remain wings of the Tory party, which would have implemented May’s Brexit deal with the backstop replaced by alternative arrangements.The Forest of Dean MP is one of the less well-known names to have expressed an interest in the top job, and has odds to match. The 49-year-old worked under Theresa May as immigration minister and was behind the controversial campaign that sent vans around the country displaying the slogan: “Here illegally? Go home or risk arrest”.His tenure was cut short after he discovered his self-employed cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK. He later became the minister for disabled people and the chief whip.The former universities minister is the only Conservative MP running on the offer of a second Brexit referendum – but with odds of 2001 he looks unlikely to be putting this into practice. Gyimah, the MP for East Surrey since 2010, became the 13th candidate to run for Theresa May’s job. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker resigned from the government in November in protest at her deal.While hugely influential within the Conservative party, he is little known outside it. Brady stood down as the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs shortly after May’s announcement and later confirmed that he was considering running, saying he had been approached by several Tory colleagues.Previously seen as a definite outsider, her promotion from international development secretary to defence after the sacking of Gavin Williamson has significantly bolstered her position. As both a confirmed Brexiter and a social liberal, she could unite different camps, but Mordaunt remains relatively untested.A not entirely serious place in the list for the housing and communities secretary, who insists he is not standing, for the achievement of gaining unexpected prominence simply through owning four ovens. Leadership bids have been made and lost on less.The former deputy chair of the Conservative party pulled out of the race on 4 June. He had been the 11th person to declare his leadership bid. The chief secretary to the Treasury has ruled herself out, but told the Sunday : “We need someone who has backed Brexit from the start.”The work and pensions secretary says: “I don’t think it is my time at the moment,” but has hinted she would be prepared to work with Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801c485849ef252e0a176d8b3065ab51cbb7a997/0_0_1995_1197/master/1995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=075b65a96b1af5fe45b7da7ba767a6bf","title":"anxiety revolution kidnapping therapy secrets from across the world","story":"As part of the ’s new mental health series, psychiatrists and psychologists from around the globe talk about the view from the couchIllustrations by Alex HedworthEyecandyOye Gureje, professor of psychiatryBanditry, terrorism and kidnapping are on the rise in Nigeria, and life is not getting any less chaotic in our cities. These are factors that predispose mental health problems, and although we don’t have good survey data on this, we probably have more problems than other countries.We have 250 psychiatrists serving 200 million people. That’s barely one per million – an incredibly low number.For most Nigerians with common mental disorders like depression, anxiety, PTSD or some degree of substance-use disorder, the chances are that they will never get treatment.If they have the most severe mental disorders like psychosis, then most will end up with either a faith healer – usually Pentecostal or Islamic – or a traditional healer.They use herbs and apparently some of them are efficacious. They use rituals, sacrifices, prayer, fasting, holy oil and holy water, but also things that are potentially harmful, like shackling, beating, prolonged fasting and scarification.We found that in Ibadan, a fairly well resourced city of about 2.5 million people, we had about 90 places for admission for mental illness, whereas healers had just over 400 places. So irrespective of what we feel about what they’re doing, what we need to do is look at how we can improve the service they offer.Not acknowledging a mental health problem doesn’t stop it manifesting in other ways, and there seems to be a rising tide of suicides across the country. Whether there really is more suicide or whether it’s just considered more newsworthy at the moment, I don’t know.We can’t train hundreds more psychiatrists overnight. But the government needs to pay more attention, to improve policy and implement programmes, and they can do that with the resources already available. And we need to train up our primary care providers to recognise and treat common mental disorders. As told to Ruth MacleanBut thanks to the media and also a lot of popular films and books, psychotherapy is becoming more mainstream and less marginalised here. Especially among hipsters, the young creative class, it’s seen as a sign of caring for yourself. I work with highly motivated patients and have a long waiting list.That’s still a small slice of society. For many other Russians, psychotherapy is still a curiosity. Therapy is far more popular and available in big cities like Moscow than in more remote areas of Russia.I hear a lot of stories. One client told me she had been to a psychologist who started recommending books that she should start reading: classics like Tolstoy and Chekhov. The doctor said it would tell the story of her life and could serve as a model for how to behave. Obviously that doesn’t work.Antidepressants are becoming more popular and the growth in their use is somewhat chaotic. Since people don’t really trust psychiatrists, some prescribe themselves antidepressants. It’s not hard to get your hands on them via the internet.I’ve studied abroad in the west, and I don’t think that Russians require a different approach. But I do think Russians have got used to a harsher way of being treated by doctors. And then when you use a more humane approach, they immediately say, “Yes, that’s what I wanted.” As told to Andrew RothThere are still stigmas about mental health treatment in Egypt. One is that once you start treatment, it will open up a can of worms and you’ll never be able to get out of it. Another is that having treatment makes you weak, or “crazy”, in a way that could affect your work, or your chances of getting married. But these are lessening with time.The state of Egyptian mental health has changed a lot since I graduated in 2001. I don’t want to use the word better, but it’s certainly developing in terms of the training that practitioners and nurses get, for in-patient treatment.The main problem that I tend to treat is anxiety, and this is definitely increasing. There are several reasons for this. One is the 2011 revolution in Egypt and everything that came along with it, but also the invention of smartphones. Worldwide, the increasing use of technology and social media is definitely increasing their levels of anxiety.My observation is that there’s a clear generational ide in the patients I see. Younger patients tend to be more aware about therapies as a rule. While whether someone was pro-revolution or not doesn’t determine if they have anxiety, the younger pro-revolution generation that wanted to make a difference has been more focused on their mental health in the eight years since. There’s certainly a need and a demand for mental health services in Egypt. It’s not an easy place to live, especially right now with the country undergoing tough austerity measures. But there are a range of talking therapies on offer from CBT to existential therapy.There are public and private options. Still, it’s safe to say that I see the people who can afford to pay, and while sessions aren’t cheap I do operate on a sliding scale based on what people can afford. I think many providers do the same here.In the end, it’s not about how much money someone has. Sometimes I see wealthy people where their level of awareness about mental health is limited due to their upbringing and mentality, while someone with fewer means is more exposed because they’re online more, or they’re younger. As told to Ruth MichaelsonDr George Hu, chief of mental health, Shanghai United Family Pudong HospitalI see almost anyone and everyone, but more than half of my patients are children and adolescents. They most often present with anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviour, which can manifest as learning problems, attention and hyperactivity difficulties, and behavioural problems. These symptoms arise from a variety of sources, but they often come from a difficulty in their relationship with their parents. We have a lot of absent parents who have not been able to prioritise their relationship with their children.In China now we have a large middle class, as well as people who are very poor, and people who are very rich. What we’re seeing is that the two tails of the bell curve are coming closer together in terms of mental health difficulties. Obviously there are galactic differences in income and lifestyle, but whether you’re a CEO or a migrant worker, if you live apart from your children and only see them twice a month, it’s going to cause the same stress. In an effort to provide a lavish and advantageous lifestyle, the rich are inadvertently causing themselves many of the same problems as the poor.There’s definitely a change in attitudes to mental health, which used to be a taboo subject. The Chinese public system has rolled out resource access to 1.4 billion people in a way that’s unprecedented. Where there’s room for improvement is in access to psychotherapy as a valid mental healthcare treatment, in complement with psychiatry. It’s very much on the radar, but psychotherapy takes time and training, there are a lot of moving parts.I think technology will lead the way to increase access to psychotherapy. Attitudes to technology are much more open in China, and there are no old, established ways to push against. I’ve been able to establish a distance psychotherapy practice that would face significant hurdles in the US.There’s a lot of work to do, but we’re in an exciting place. As told to Andrew KilleenJuan Tenconi, former president of the Argentine Association of PsychiatristsArgentina far outranks any other country in the world with its number of psychologists. Here, we have 223 psychologists per 100,000 inhabitants, while second-ranking Netherlands clocks in at only 123, Germany 50 and the USA 30, according to the World Health Organization.This means that, if you are suffering from a mild neurosis, if you want to know yourself better or are seeking to improve yourself, you are in a fantastic situation in terms of mental healthcare.On the other hand, if you have a low income and a severe mental condition and are forced to rely on the public medical system you may find yourself in a problem, depending to a large extent on where you live.The public health system is overstretched and underfinanced. Some provinces have very good mental healthcare, but far from all of them. Public hospitals will often run out of psychiatric drugs, just the same as they run out of penicillin or medical gauze.One of the main problems is there are no separate wards for mental health patients, so someone with a case of schizophrenia can end up in the same room as a patient who’s just had a heart attack, with all the trauma this can cause both patients.So if you are living in a shanty town and have a severe condition you may end up interned in inadequate facilities. The problem could be compounded soon by the new national health law that foresees closing down the old psychiatric hospitals during 2020. This will throw a large number of patients out on the street: many of them will end up homeless.As told to Uki GoñiAlberto Pellai, psychotherapist and researcher, University of MilanMental illnesses are on the rise among Italians. The most common and widespread disorder is depression. However, despite Italy’s intermediate ranking among European countries, numbers do not reflect the true scope of the problem. Stats do not consider iniduals who continue to believe that seeking the help of a psychologist or psychiatrist is for “crazy” people. There is still an entrenched cultural prejudice in Italy toward psychotherapy and antidepressants, which are viewed as ineffective or only for people who have lost their mind.The use of antidepressants is rising too, as are mental illnesses among adolescents. Among teenagers and their European cohort social isolation syndrome is increasing. Their lives play out entirely in their bedrooms. They inhabit a virtual world, glued to their computer or mobile phone screens. This has led to a growing challenge for young people to socialise.… Those suffering from less grave disturbances, such as attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity, risk bypassing others with serious signs of depression. The risk is that someone with suicidal tendencies goes from thought to action before receiving psychotherapeutic help in a public facility.

However, a lack of NHS services and people’s unwillingness to seek help means that more than half of those who self-harm do not receive any medical or psychological care.“An increase in the prevalence of using self-harm to cope with emotional stress could have serious long-term implications,” said Prof Louis Appleby of Manchester University, one of the authors.“There is a risk that self-harm will become normalised for young people, and iniduals who start to self-harm when young might adopt the behaviour as a long-term coping strategy. “Non-suicidal self-harm may be associated with later suicide. As young people get older, reaching age groups that already have higher suicide rates, the self-harm they have learned may become more serious and more likely to have a fatal outcome,” he added.The study, funded by the NHS and the government, is based on analysis of data collected for the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, which comes out every seven years. It involved three cohorts of between 6,444 and 7,243 people aged 16 to 74.Jemima Olchawski, the chief executive of Agenda, the alliance for women and girls at risk, said physical and sexual abuse were key reasons why so many more women than men were self-harming.“It’s very worrying to see this sharp increase in self-harm, particularly among young women. It’s clear young and girls are facing a mental health crisis,” she said.“We can’t ignore the fact that poor mental health among women and girls is often closely linked to violence and abuse, such as experience of physical abuse from a partner, sexual abuse as a child or sexual abuse as an adult.”Emma Thomas, the chief executive of YoungMinds, said childhood poverty, neglect and abuse, exam pressures, bullying using social media and increasing concerns over body image were driving up rates of self-harm.Experts warned that people self-harming because they are in mental turmoil are being denied help because NHS care is still inadequate. Thomas said: “At the moment, it’s far too difficult for children and young people to get mental health support before they reach crisis point.”NHS England has pledged to greatly increase the availability of mental health care, especially for young people and those of any age undergoing a mental health crisis. Services are more plentiful than 2014, the last year on which the new findings are based, sources pointed out.Nikita, who is 27, self-harmed for two years from the age of 13. She is now the deputy chair of trustees at the Wish Centre self-harm project in Harrow, north London, where peer support helped her to stop cutting herself.“I would cut my arms and legs. I still have the scars from doing that.“Why did I do it? At the time, I had a lot of friendship issues. There were difficulties with relationships and rivalries and I didn’t feel that I really fitted in anywhere. I was still figuring out who I was, where I wanted to go in life and was feeling low on self-confidence and a bit worthless, and that I would never achieve anything.“I felt like a failure, like I was always letting people down around me. I ended up in self-destruct mode, and doing harm to myself emotionally, like being in a friendship group that wasn’t healthy or good for me.“It got to the stage where I was self-harming every day, was on the verge of being expelled from school and didn’t feel like I had anyone in my life who wanted me around and who I could confide in. I feared that I was going to feel like this for the rest of my life and that I would remain meaningless.“When I cut myself I felt a sense of relief. It was an outlet for the pain I was feeling. I felt like I was punishing myself. I wanted to inflict pain on myself, because I felt I should have been a better person, better friend and better daughter than I was. After cutting myself I felt that I had punished myself and could go about the rest of my day. This went on until I was 15.“My school referred me to the Wish Centre, where I got a combination of counselling and peer support, and I was able to stop self-harming. That felt like a big victory, because until then I felt like cutting myself was something I would always do.“I’m proof that people can recover from self-harming. I’ve never relapsed since I stopped 12 years ago.“There is a lot of self-harm around. That’s due to childhood abuse, family relationship problems, mental health issues, low self-esteem and bullying. But I don’t think it’s more common these days. I just think people are more open about it than before.”As told to Denis Campbell"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b52aa5cd8920ee4bbe93b22343adf0b21feeeb/250_98_2098_1259/master/2098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98612a4b171012556ed1629c2ea6a6cf","title":"anthony joshua andy ruiz jr rematch boxing","story":"Anthony Joshua will get the chance to win back his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles in a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr later this year.Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, announced the contracted rematch clause was triggered on Tuesday and the second fight will take place in November or December, with a venue still to be confirmed.The Briton suffered a shock defeat, the first of his career, when he was stopped by Ruiz Jr in the seventh round at Madison Square Garden last weekend.Joshua said shortly after the fight that he had not even been aware there was a rematch clause. “I didn’t even ask about a rematch clause because I was so confident I was going to win,” he said. “If it’s there, we’ll go again and I’ll get the titles back.

She later downplayed a performance that the seven-times Roland Garros champion Chris Evert described as “one of the best clay-court matches ever”.“I did a lot of things well today. More than anything, I thought it was a consistent performance. Sloane is a great player. I am proud and happy with how I am rolling and keeping the pressure on.

Some of the enjoyment is to keep trying and play the game.”Asked about comparisons being made with Barker and Jo Durie, the last female British players to go this far in the French Open, she said: “This is my third time in a grand slam semi-final. I’d like to go one and two steps further, though.“It’s always nice to be in great company and to be among great players. Other than that, tennis is a global sport. There is a great sense of pride to be alongside my compatriots from years before. Sloane is a great player, one of the best in the world. She made the final last year.“She raises her level, and I was pleased I could get my foot down early on and maintain that throughout the match.”As for her transformation from never having won in Paris to grand-slam threat, she said: “There hasn’t been a major click it’s always a process and progression of work.

Victory, though, has delivered him an even tougher assignment, the ultimate test on clay: a semi-final against the surface’s finest exponent, Rafael Nadal, their 39th career encounter.The defending champion Nadal had a far easier time of it against Kei Nishikori – winning 6-1, 6-1, 6-3 in under two hours – than Federer did in seeing off the stubborn muscularity of Wawrinka, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4 in three hours and 35 minutes.The tie-breaks could have gone either way, as Wawrinka played with the sort of fierce energy and power of which few players are capable, but Federer, husbanding his resources, had enough energy and nous to win for the 23rd time against him in 26 matches.Nadal is still favourite to win a 12th title here, slightly ahead of the world No 1 Novak Djokovic, who plays Alexander Zverev in the second match on Court Philippe Chatrier on Wednesday, with Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov also on second, on Court Suzanne Lenglen. There is consensus the Serb is the only player left in the draw capable of stopping a rampant Nadal – and that is what the Spaniard has been for most of the tournament.On day 10, he was as brilliant as he was on day one, when he beat the German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann – followed by another German qualifier called Yannick: Maden. David Goffin was his first genuine threat, and the Belgian became the only opponent to take a set off him so far. Nishikori, seeded seventh, was made to look second rate as Nadal made him suffer in the sultry, windy conditions.As Nishikori said later : “I played too many hours on court the past week. Today, Rafa didn’t let me play how I wanted to play. If I’m not fresh, it’s not easy to stay with him. He hit very heavy, and he was serving well. He made me play every point. Even to get one game, it felt like very long. Credit to him, playing great tennis this week.”Nishikori, who nearly beat Nadal on the clay of Madrid a few years ago before his body let him down, had the trainer on at the start of the third set, having won only two games in the first two. There are uphill battles and there is trailing Nadal at Roland Garros with a sore right shoulder.Nadal said later: “I have been playing well, very solid. Winning good matches against tough opponents like today. I am happy with that.” He added: “Of course having Roger in the semi-finals is an extra thing. We shared the most important moments of our careers together. It is another episode. I am happy for that and excited, no? Will be a special moment. Let’s try to be ready for it.”Federer and Wawrinka went at it from the first ball to the last in a thrilling encounter, full of rich strokes and no little emotion. Wawrinka had by far the more exhausting route to the quarter-finals but was not complaining.“I played really good from the beginning of the tournament,” he said. “I won some big matches, especially against Cristian Garín, played super well against Grigor Dimitrov. Then there were tough matches in two days followed by Stefanos Tsitsipas, who is really confident and playing well this year. But I was ready physically after all that time on the court. Today, to give another big battle against Roger was a tough one for sure. But I think in general it was a good battle, a great battle.”In the pivotal third set, Federer had to battle through five deuce points in the 11th game to keep Wawrinka at bay and retain the lead on serve, but he could not avoid a second tie-break. Again he prevailed, but not before Wawrinka saved one of three set points with an ace.Serving for the match at 5-4 in the fourth set, Federer double-faulted on his second match point but made sure of his concluding volley, and they embraced at the net with genuine warmth. Whatever their occasional differences in the past, they remain close friends and grand representatives of one of the sport’s smallest countries.“He didn’t know. I was, like: ‘OK, clearly, there is misunderstandings or he’s not sure yet.’ I think it was just an emotional moment, And I think he was at a breaking point where he realised: ‘I cannot keep playing any more.’ I have been there. Like at Wimbledon, for instance, that year in 2016, I realised I cannot keep doing what I’m doing like this. It’s just not healthy any more.”Except he did. And on Thursday he will play in his eighth semi-final at the French Open. It, too, might be his last match here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a518090b9bce9d2f6d097c5e135faaf678feb02c/0_59_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c7563f6f466adaf28dfe3566aa02bfe","title":"sri lanka afghanistan cricket world cup match report","story":"When Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996, Afghanistan did not even have a cricket team. So the fact they failed to pull off what would have been a famous first victory in this tournament against a Test-playing nation should be seen in its proper context.Still, this will feel like an opportunity missed for a country who have defied the odds to rise to the sport’s top table after being formally recognised by the International Cricket Council only in 2001.Set a Duckworth-Lewis-Stern-adjusted target of 187 to win in 41 overs, Afghanistan fell 35 runs short. Given they have won more ODIs than Sri Lanka since the 2015 World Cup, victory here would not have been a shock. It would have been significant, though, given that in seven previous World Cup games they had beaten only Scotland. Getting over the line against a full-member nation is the next step.Given the drama this nerve-jangling contest offered up it was a shame so few people were present to witness it. The official attendance was fewer than 5,000 in a ground that holds 15,200. More disappointing is the fact 8,500 tickets were sold and 3,000 given away to local schools but the vast majority, presumably put off by dire weather forecasts, failed to turn up.Yet Sri Lanka will just be relieved to have got their campaign back on track after New Zealand thumped them by 10 wickets in their opening game last Saturday.In the end they were thankful for career-best ODI figures from Nuwan Pradeep, the right-arm seam bowler taking four wickets for 31, and the trusty slingshot of Lasith Malinga, who took three, for a victory that keeps their World Cup hopes alive.Sri Lanka had thrown away a fine start to their innings, which had seen Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera put on 92 for the first wicket, thanks to a spectacular collapse inspired by Mohammad Nabi.The off-spinner’s three wickets in the 22nd – Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews falling in the space of five deliveries – turned the contest on its head.Hamid Hassan, the headbanded fast bowler, then pounced in the next over when he took Dhananjaya de Silva’s outside edge. Sri Lanka had lost four wickets for five runs in 11 balls to slip from 144 for one to 149 for five.You had to feel for Kusal Perera, who had batted beautifully to secure his 12th ODI half-century. But there was little he could do to stop the collective neurosis at the other end. Thisara Perera was a case in point, run out by Mohammad Shahzad after sharp work in the field.By the time the rain arrived, Kusal Perera had also gone. You could not really blame him for trying the reverse sweep that saw him deflect Rashid Khan behind on 78, especially after he had watched the agricultural heave that had seen Isuru Udana bowled by Dawlat Zadran in the previous over.Sri Lanka, 182 for eight after 33 overs, had some respite when the rain fell. When play resumed they added another 19 in 23 balls. It said much that the second-highest scorer in the innings was extras with 35.Afghanistan’s pursuit of a manageable target got off to a good start when they knocked off 34 of the required runs inside five overs.But the loss of Mohammad Shahzad, steering Malinga to midwicket, and Rahmat Shah, caught off Udana at slip, and then Pradeep’s dismissal of Hazratullah Zazai got Sri Lanka back into the game.The big-hitting Hazratullah had been dropped on 24 by Kusal Mendis. Luckily for Sri Lanka the missed chance only cost them six runs as Thisara Perera took a spectacular catch at long leg.Hashmatullah Shahidi and Nabi also fell as Afghanistan lost five wickets for 23 runs to slip to 57 for five in the 14th over.A 64-run sixth-wicket stand between the captain, Gulbadin Naib, and Najibullah Zadran stabilised things. But when the former fell leg-before to Pradeep, it left his side still needing 66 with four wickets remaining.Pradeep and Malinga, along with a with a fine direct-hit run out of Najibullah Zadran by Karunaratne that brought the ninth Afghanistan wicket, ensured there would be no fairytale comeback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96320bec4bf6fa0a61534984fc0b84ca305c73af/43_99_4936_2962/master/4936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=897e83628a2f211e1dd0591da3278fcb","title":"kes author barry hines lost play about miners strike to be staged for first time","story":"Barry Hines’s After the Strike, about the violence at Orgreave, lay untouched for 35 yearsA lost play about the miners’ strike by the acclaimed author behind Kes is to be performed in public for the first time, more than 30 years after it was deemed too controversial for television.After the Strike was written by the novelist Barry Hines in 1985 and depicted graphic scenes of police violence against striking miners at the Battle of Orgreave a year earlier.Despite Hines being at the height of his critical acclaim at the time, the work was never broadcast and lay untouched for 35 years until it was discovered by researchers in the late author’s university archive.The work, which will be performed for the first time at Sheffield’s Kelham Island Museum on 18 June, is described as an unflinching account of clashes between police and miners at Orgreave on 18 June 1984 and the “multiple corrosive effects” it had on the South Yorkshire community.The play was found among other unpublished works in Hines’s archive, which was donated to the University of Sheffield after his death, aged 76, in March 2016. It was accompanied by a note from his wife, Eleanor Hines, which said she had a “vague memory of ‘the powers that be’ not being interested in the strike any more”.Dr David Forrest, a senior lecturer in film studies at the University of Sheffield, said Hines became deeply embedded with the National Union of Mineworkers and carried out a series of interviews with miners after the clashes at Orgreave.His two unpublished accounts, one of which is After the Strike, were too politically sensitive to be aired at the time, Forrest said. “It’s true that they are very, very politically didactic and explicit and they make absolutely no bones about their position,” he said.“It would have been unrealistic to expect any broadcaster to have picked them up at the time, particularly because they depict quite graphically police brutality at Orgreave. It was clearly something he had to get out of his system.”Hines, whose most famous book A Kestrel for a Knave inspired Ken Loach’s classic film Kes, was at the height of his acclaim in 1985 following his Bafta-winning drama-documentary Threads, which was set in Sheffield during the cold war and chronicled the effect of a nuclear bomb dropped on a northern English city.The son and grandson of mineworkers, Hines “mourned what he saw as the wanton destruction of communities”, Forrest said, and was “particularly exercised by the events at Orgreave and their consequences”.“As a committed working-class writer, Hines felt duty-bound to document what he had seen over the course of the strike,” he said. “This performance is now a chance for people to experience one of Hines’s unpublished pieces of work for the first time while also celebrating his legacy and commemorating the struggles of miners and their families on the 35th anniversary of the Battle of Orgreave.”Hines, who was born in a mining village near Barnsley, had described how he desperately wanted to write television screenplays about the miners’ strike and wrote scripts for the BBC, but “they did not work”.After the Strike’s first airing is taking place as part of a series of exhibitions on gentrification, hipster culture and regeneration hosted by the University of Sheffield and the Kelham Island Museum.Built in the 1100s, Kelham Island was for centuries a key part of the steel city’s industrial power. In recent years, however, the island’s once-booming cutlery and steel works, factories and workshops have become transformed into a hipster paradise with microbreweries, galleries and independent shopping arcades.Dr Amanda Crawley Jackson, the director of engagement at the University of Sheffield’s faculty of arts and humanities, said the exhibition aimed to tell the untold stories behind the island’s regeneration “and the impact this change has and continues to have on people in the local community”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc896c28070690d234e150cacbf11d17ed688a8c/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d81f481b5eed191799687f4b395225df","title":"europe uk theme parks family days out readers","story":"From Moomins in Finland to zooming down slides in the Pyrenees, our readers pick thrilling parks across EuropeThis mountain park is home to Tobotronc, a really exhilarating 5km toboggan run – the world’s longest alpine slide – which runs through evergreen forest.

Where does the time go? The children Apted first filmed in 1964, and has revisited every seven years since, are now – except for Lynn, who sadly died a year after the last film was made – heading for retirement age. Footage from so many previous ages now mingles with the new that it feels as if we are watching ghosts playing in a maze. Ebullient children become shy teenagers. Shy teens tag nervous twentysomethings. Nervous twentysomethings shift and thicken into true adults and learn to bend their heads against strong winds, flying branches and other vicissitudes of life.Last night’s programme caught up with Andrew, the little boy who was first seen in 7 Up singing Waltzing Matilda in Latin with some of his fellow prep-schoolers Sue, who was insistent in her 20s about not getting married too young and has now been engaged, after a relatively late marriage that nevertheless ended in orce, to Glen for 20 years (“No plans!” she says, gaily) East End cabbie Tony and Nick, the boy from the Yorkshire Dales who became a nuclear physicist and lecturer in the US and now has throat cancer. “I’m focused on fairly short-term futures at the moment,” he says, before enthusiastically explaining some of his treatments and their ramifications. Once a teacher …The point of the series has always been to test the truth of the adage: “Give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man.” Andrew, a lawyer, seems very much still Andrew. Quiet, hardworking, modest, appreciative of his privilege and the life that he has seemingly successfully replicated for his children.Tony – always the most ebullient of the children – has retained almost all the irrepressibility of youth. References suggest one of his children – whose own child he and his wife Debbie have brought up as their own – has been through (and put them through) a lot, but he still fizzes with energy and humour. He has bounced back from the collapse of his dream of a second home and a business in Spain and has settled in a semi-retirement-age village back in Essex. No one under 50 can live there, and most of the inhabitants are East Enders who have decamped to the countryside for better golfing and more leisurely pubbing. Although he is starting to regret voting to leave the EU, he says: “Life couldn’t be better, really!” And their marriage, after his “regretful behaviour” recorded in previous instalments, is “solid”. Or, as Debbie puts it: “Good at the moment.” So many ghosts. Including those of the films not made. I would watch Debbie’s.His fellow East Ender Sue is also content. Her two children are still single, “got good jobs, bought their own flats”, and she is a university administrator, due to retire in three years and just about able to see that a life without the work she loves might not be too bad. But she worries for others’ futures. “I see homeless people all the time … My generation had wonderful support from the council, which got me on to the ladder and changed my life. People are struggling now.”Nick remembers his “single moment of pure, unadulterated joy in my life – when my son was handed to me.” His students are wonderful and he is still “hanging on in there as long as possible with them”. The boy who was educated in a one-room schoolhouse in the Dales loves the US – “It’s a lot easier to get things done here” – although he boggles at Trump. But trips home to Yorkshire still make “other places you go seem rather trivial in comparison”. It is, of course, God’s own country.Up makes other attempts to replicate the project – let alone the reality TV shows to which it is sometimes considered a precursor – seem trivial in comparison. Apted has honed his skills over the years, becoming less presumptive and more content to let narratives unfold naturally. And, of course, the unprecedentedly long relationship between the maker and his subjects has led to more give and take between them. Set against the crudeness, manipulation and superficiality of most of what now makes up this part of the televisual field, Up starts to look like an almost noble endeavour, more akin to the raising of a medieval church amid the housing estates thrown up by the rest to make a quick buck.See you at 70 Up, I hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156efb4660dc0f0b1006f90111644226ed034466/0_410_8508_5105/master/8508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49228dc7628bf857d2cb5cfc144b6d31","title":"three venezuelan families a photo essay","story":"Silvana Trevale left Venezuela in 2011 but has returned to document the ever worsening crisis that has deeply affected families of every economic status. She was selected as the 2018 recipient of the Joan Wakelin Bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyVenezuela, a country that once hoped for wealth and a bright future with its oil reserves and natural resources, is falling to pieces. It faces a humanitarian crisis where families struggle daily to find food, medicine and clean water as they live with collapsing public services. Many attend the ongoing protests, which are frequently violently repressed. Though I left my home in 2011 I have returned to Venezuela to document the ever-worsening crisis that has deeply affected families of every economic status.As a young Venezuelan woman, my focus was to the youth of the country in relation to how the current crisis has harmedtheir past and present, and jeopardised their future. Three families with contrasting realities took part in the photo essay, allowing me into their homes so that I could gain an insight into their lives.Firstly, I met an upper-class family, who asked to keep their identity anonymous for their own security. The youngest girl, who is a past contestant in the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant, has left the country to pursue her career as a model. Her brother and sister have been out of Venezuela for more than two years, working in their fields. The father said: “If they had told me, that at my age my children were going to leave because there were no opportunities, we would have left.”He works as a hotel manager while he witnesses the economy fall apart, constantly trying to maintain a balance in his job alongside spiralling inflation. He said in January: “The difficulty in obtaining foreign currency is what has affected us the most. In October, the black market dollar equalled 90 bolivars and is now at 2,500 bolivars.”The Melean family are working hard to achieve their dreams. Estefferson, the oldest brother, is now living in Chicago and studying nursing. He is covering all of his expenses with a baseball scholarship. He returned for the holidays to visit his family and his hopes for the future are high. Estefferson said: “I can open the doors for my family, to move forward and get out of where we live, as I would like them to live in a better place in the future.” They live in El Valle in Caracas, at the bottom of a favela area that is not safe.The youngest brother, Gerson, is following the same dream. He is training to be signed by the Major League Baseball (MLB) organisation, while he continues his high school studies at the weekends. Sarai, the youngest sister, was completing her studies at the Andrés Bello Catholic University. However, she had to stop as the cost became too high for the family to cover.She said: “It’s tough to live with fear, knowing that for a pair of earrings, some shoes or a telephone they can kill you. The people are so desperate, they are so hungry.”Yesenia, their mother, works full time as a secretary, although she sometimes does not make it to her job across the city. With the current electricity blackouts, transportation is not working most days Public transport is not available because of the lack of spare parts and their high prices.Lastly, the Fermin family lives in a small town called Mamporal, a 90-minute drive from Caracas. The mother has 11 children however many of them have left the country or are residing in other states of Venezuela. Five of her children live at home with her and her husband, Felix. The oldest son living at home is Abraham, who is away during the week while he trains to join the military.The 15-year-old son, also called Felix, said: “I want to be an artist to help my mom.”. He spends his time drawing Catholic figures with the hope of becoming an artist one day. Carmen, the youngest girl, said: “My desire is to leave Venezuela, become a doctor and help my family.”Wanda, 17, was seven months pregnant with twins when I photographed her. She had been raped by a neighbour. Wanda has since given birth to two girls. The Fermin family struggle to feed themselves and the children are showing signs of malnutrition, as they often miss out on breakfast and dinner.Imelda, the mother, has cancer and no treatment is available in the country. They have travelled several times to Caracas in search of medical attention, often without success. When Wanda was about to give birth, they were taken to Caracas in search of a hospital that could help them, after visiting four hospitals and being rejected because of a lack of space and facilities. Finally, as a relative knew a doctor in one of the hospitals, they managed to take Wanda in and look after her during her birth.Venezuela’s current crisis seems to have no end in sight. The country’s citizens are doing what they can to continue, but it is becoming harder day by day. The younger generation, still proclaim some hope at least. I am reminded of the moment when Carlos, Wanda and Carmen were playing in the water. They danced as if they had a break from reality, as if the water washed away their troubles for a moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ca529602c0155aef62c8d9f96786093dccff7a3/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a7a31888ada5c90d76d586dd0a4fd51","title":"baghdads green zone reopens to public after 16 years","story":"Thousands of walls have been removed from area, which is now open ‘without exceptions’Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone has reopened to the public after 16 years.Maj Gen Jassim Yahya Abd Ali said the area, which houses the US embassy and Iraqi government offices, was now open “24 hours a day without any exceptions or conditions”. He said authorities had removed 12,000 concrete walls from the area.Atheir Assem, 25, who drove inside the Green Zone for the first time on Tuesday, said: “I feel that Baghdad is bigger than before.”He said his generation knew nothing about the Green Zone and had felt that the people there lived in another country. “Now there is no difference and this is beautiful,” he said.The zone, measuring 4 sq miles, has been off limits to the public since the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.Before the war it was home to Saddam Hussein’s palaces. It became known as Little America after it was seized by US military forces, and in later years it became a hated symbol of the country’s inequality, fuelling perceptions among Iraqis that their government was out of touch.Only Iraqis with special security badges could enter the area. Various attempts and promises by the Iraqi government to open the zone to traffic failed to bear fruit because of persistent security concerns.The government began easing restrictions in the area this year. The prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, said the Green Zone would be fully open to the public on Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.Abdullah Mouhamed, a taxi driver, said: “Thank god the opening of the Green Zone happened during the Eid. It is a very good initiative and will ease transportation in Baghdad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cadb274a7081b55f911cd34c4c0166f3093f3f1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60ff07d27e33391db0fcaa08fabc933","title":"tiananmen square massacre marked with hong kong vigil","story":"More than 100,000 gather for anniversary but many fear for future of commemorationMore than 100,000 people have gathered in Hong Kong for a candlelight vigil to mark the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.The event is the biggest and traditionally the only major commemoration of the incident allowed in China. Taiwan also marked the massacre with a vigil and exhibition on “Tank man” – the man photographed standing in front of tanks on 5 June 1989.On the mainland, all talk of the Chinese army’s killing of thousands of peaceful student protesters is forbidden. But Hong Kong has had a level of independence under the “one country, two systems” rule enacted after Britain relinquished control to China in 1997.On Tuesday evening, crowds filled the six football pitches of Victoria Park, suggesting the number of attendees could break the 2012 record of 180,000.The streets leading to the park were lined with pro-democracy stalls and demonstrators handing out posters and flyers.Audrey Eu, a former legislator and a founder of the Civic party, handed out flyers as young members addressed the crowd. “Even though they’re not yet 30 years old, they’re so passionate about it,” she said.Lee Cheuk-yan, a veteran activist and former legislator, stood on a stepladder at the entrance, thanking and shaking the hands of those who walked in.In April 1989, popular Chinese reformist leader Hu Yaobang died. Two days after his death, on 17 April, several hundred students marched to Tiananmen Square and laid a wreath to him. They called for greater freedom of speech, economic freedoms and curbs on corruption. The demonstrations spread to hundreds of cities.On 26 April, an editorial in the Communist Party’s People’s Daily denounced the student demonstrations as a ‘premeditated and organised conspiracy and turmoil’. The next day, tens of thousands of students in Beijing staged a demonstration to protest against the editorial. On 13 May, just two days before the arrival of Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev for a state visit, hundreds of students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. The protests forced the cancellation of the welcoming ceremony. On 20 May, martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Troops moved in, but were blocked by the civilians and demonstrations continued.In the early hours of 4 June, Chinese troops launched a two-pronged attack with orders to put down the protests. Armoured cars and tanks smashed through the citizens’ barricades. Some forty workers who went to plead with the soldiers were shot. On 5 June, an unidentified young man stood in front of a tank convoy leaving Tiananmen Square, in a final act of defiance. The actual number of deaths from the crackdown remains unknown, but it is believed the Chinese army killed at least 10,000 people, according to a secret diplomatic cable from the British ambassador to Beijing.Thirty years on, the Chinese authorities continue to view the Tiananmen protests as one of the most sensitive and taboo subjects. ‘June 4’, as the movement is commonly known as in China, remains largely scrubbed from official history and is censored from school text books and online. The authorities punish those who try to commemorate the event, and relatives of the victims who died during the massacre are barred from openly mourning their loved ones.“After 30 years, there is still so many candlelight vigils … and so many people come out to fight for their rights, you feel hopeful. How can you give up when others won’t give up?” Lee told the  last week.“The whole of China is silenced, and we have a window, or a loudspeaker for that in Hong Kong, to tell the world what happened.”Lee was a young labour organiser in 1989, sent to the student protests in Tiananmen Square with funds activists had raised in Hong Kong.“I heard the gunshots and saw the tanks rolling in, the rickshaws taking injured people,” he said. “It went from high hope to despair for me.”Lee was detained and forced to apologise before being allowed to return to Hong Kong, where he now runs the June 4th Museum. He says many visitors are mainlanders, and the museum has been targeted by harassment and vandalism.“When I came back from Beijing 20 years ago, people told me to make sure you tell the world the truth,” he said.As night fell in Hong Kong, thousands of candles flickered. People cried as the crowd joined in songs, before chanting slogans and the date of the incident. Footage of the massacre was broadcast on a giant screen and some turned away as the recorded sound of Chinese guns rang out. The crowd broke its silence to yell at an image of the then Chinese leader, Li Peng.Jimmy So, 60, and Chung King Wah, 70, said they had attended all 30 vigils since the massacre.“We want the Chinese Communist party to recognise the mistake of the June 4 crackdown and massacre, and we will come here every year until they do,” So said.Members of the standing committee of the Hong Kong Alliance laid a wreath and lit a flame of remembrance, and key members of the movement addressed the crowd in Cantonese, including the vice-chair, Chow Hang Tung, and representatives of the Tiananmen Mothers group.Lau Ka-yee, a core member of the group who is based in Hong Kong, said she could not visit China because of her activism, and none of the mothers had been able to attend the vigil.“They even can’t go out of their home in Beijing. Some time about May or June they have to leave Beijing to their home village,” she said.A proposed Hong Kong bill to allow the transfer of fugitives to mainland China, which many fear will be the end of Hong Kong as a safe haven, was a constant theme at the vigil.There are widespread fears the new law could be used to target political dissidents and attending the vigil may soon become too dangerous.Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator, said: “It may sound exaggerated to outsiders, but if you look at China and how it practises its rule of law, if there is such a thing, it’s anything goes.”Beijing launched a crackdown before the anniversary, detaining key activists or sending them on enforced “vacations”.Hong Kong immigration officials also assisted, deporting on arrival an exiled dissident and a former Peking University student, Feng Congde, on Sunday evening.Regina Ip, a legislator, said she believed it was because Congde had intended to go to the vigil.“Hong Kong allows our people to hold the annual June 4 candlelight vigils. They have a right to express their views, to remember whatever happened 30 years ago,” she said.“But we don’t have to allow high-profile dissidents to come in and stir up further emotions. What’s the point?”Lee said Ip’s comments were ridiculous. “We can already stir up the emotion. It’s already there,” he said. travelled to Hong Kong with the assistance of the Judith Neilson Institute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d21ebd90493c5bd8a3a875de30b49331025d9e5/0_0_2458_1474/master/2458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5a4cd15248b59a7b8401d8c2ecfd16","title":"us imposes new cuba travel restrictions including ban on cruises","story":"Trump administration says ‘group educational travel’ and cruise ships will no longer be ways for US citizens to visit CubaThe Trump administration has imposed heavy new restrictions on travel to Cuba by US citizens, including a ban on cruises, in a bid to further pressure the communist island over its support for Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro.The tightening of the decades-old US embargo on the Caribbean’s largest island will further wound its crippled economy as well as hurt US travel companies that had built up business with Cuba during a brief 2014-2016 detente under Barack Obama.The state department said the United States would no longer allow “group people-to-people educational travel”, one of the most popular exemptions to the overall ban on US tourism to Cuba.The United States will also no longer permit visits to Cuba via passenger and recreational vessels, including cruise ships and yachts, as well as private and corporate aircraft, it said.The Trump administration had announced the new restrictions in April.It also last month allowed US citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies for the use of property confiscated after Cuba’s 1959 revolution, hurting investment in the island.“The administration has advanced the president’s Cuba policy by ending ‘veiled tourism’ to Cuba and imposing restrictions on vessels,” said a tweet from Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton, who has led the US campaign against what he has called the “troika of tyranny” of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.“We will continue to take actions to restrict the Cuban regime’s access to US dollars.”Bruno Rodriguez, Cuba’s foreign minister, said on Twitter the move was “an attack on international law” and the embargo was the main obstacle to the country’s development, thereby violating Cubans’ human rights.This is the second time the Trump administration has tightened US travel restrictions on Cuba. While the measures are designed to hit government coffers, they are also hurting Cuba’s fledgling private sector, which the United States has said it wants to support.US travel to Cuba had boomed in recent years, after Obama loosened restrictions, allowing the re-establishment of regular commercial flights and cruise services.The United States became the second-largest source of travelers to the island after Canada, with a majority arriving on cruise ships.“He thinks we are just coming here as a tourist but you are learning so much. It’s ridiculous we won’t be able to come any more,” said Cheryl Kolar, 68, a retired nurse who had traveled to Havana by cruise ship.“Cuba is the only country we are not allowed to go to. We can go to Russia, but for some reason Trump has something against Cuba.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3914723.1559673077!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"air pollution turning enniscorthy into new delhi of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA UCC professor has warned that Enniscorthy in Co Wexford is becoming the New Delhi of Ireland due to high levels of air pollution. File photograph: Getty Images. Enniscorthy in Co Wexford is fast becoming the “New Delhi of Ireland” due to the high levels of pollution in the town’s air, a professor from University College Cork has said.Speaking following the publication of data which shows air pollution across Ireland is rapidly increasing, Prof John Sodeau called on the Government to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal as soon as possible. He said the Moneypoint power station in Co Clare, which generates more than 20 per cent of the electricity in Ireland each year and sources nearly all its coal from Colombia, must also close.“It is not true to say we need more research done in assessing sources. In Ireland burning coal of all types, wood and peat add large amounts of particulate to the air,” he said. “The health of Irish citizens and climate change come first, not legal niceties. The data from Enniscorthy is irrefutable. It is rapidly becoming the New Delhi of Ireland.”The World Health Organisation has previously described the air quality in New Delhi, the capital of India, as the worst of any major city in the world.The latest data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows 84 air pollution breaches were recorded at monitoring stations across the State in the first five months of this year compared with 17 in the whole of last year. There are currently 42 monitoring stations recording the levels of fine dust particles, or PM10 particulate matter, in Ireland’s air. These fine particles come from many sources including exhaust emissions, soil and road surfaces, construction work and industrial emissions. The PM10 daily limit of 50ug.m3 is considered breached if there are more than 35 breaches at one location in a calendar year. It is understood there have been 12 breaches in Enniscorthy so far this year compared to two in all of last year, while air pollution levels in the town are 10 times over the EU limit. WartimeDescribing the ongoing climate emergency as “World War III”, Prof Sodeau called on people to adapt a mindset more in line with a wartime setting where they would accept “big lifestyle changes” such as paying additional taxes, driving electric cars and not buring coal to protect the nation’s health and ecosystem. The Government’s national ban on harmful smoky coal, which was scheduled to be introduced this September, was pushed back in April with no indication of when it will now come into force. It is understood the Department of Climate Action and Environment had been under sustained pressure from coal importers with a number of firms threatening legal action if the ban went ahead. A total of 1,500 premature deaths in Ireland are directly attributable each year to poor air quality caused by solid fuel burning, the EPA warned late last year. Dust levels are particularly high during the winter months when people’s use of solid fuels such as coal, peat and wood impacts on air quality and on health, especially in small towns and villages.Green Party MEP for Dublin Ciarán Cuffe criticised the EPA for the layout of its air pollution data saying it was “a mess to navigate” and did not explain what was causing the pollution. He added that limited monitoring was concentrated in affluent areas, warning that the last quality air monitor in Dublin’s north inner city had closed last year. “In the short-term I want the EPA to tell us more about the contributors to poor air quality. Is it industrial pollution coming from Europe, or is it emissions from traffic, home heating systems or cruise ships in Dublin Port? The public deserves to know.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3914269.1559677913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party takes ireland south seat as sinn f%C3%A9in concedes","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            The recount in progress in Nemo, Cork. Photograph: Barry RocheThe Irish TImes  Sinn Féin’s Liadh Ní Riada will not be returning to the European Parliament after the party conceded her seat in the Ireland South constituency to Grace O’Sullivan of the Green Party. Jonathan O’Brien TD, director of elections for Ms Ní Riada, confirmed a full recount would not be sought by the party after the adjudication of 100 disputed votes showed Ms O’Sullivan had gained an additional 47. Sinn Féin sought a recount last week after Ms O’Sullivan, a Senator from Tramore, Co Waterford, overtook Ms Ní Riada by 326 votes in the race to represent the constituency in the European Parliament. Ms Ní Riada polled 79,072 first preferences to Ms O’Sullivan’s 75,948 but was overtaken by the 18th count due to transfers favouring the Green Party candidate. The recount had been due to take place at Nemo Rangers GAA Club in Cork, and it was feared it could take up to 28 days to complete given the 755,987 votes to be examined. However, returning officer Martin Harvey drafted in extra counting staff and some 130 counters and 20 supervisors quickly got through the 200,000 or so papers allocated to Ms O’Sullivan and Ms Ní Riada, finding just 121 discrepancies.“There was in the region of 121 discrepancies found today,” Mr O’Brien said. “Unfortunately the overall net figure was plus 47 for Grace...it became very clear we were not closing the gap. So while we’re disappointed for Liadh, we want to congratulate Grace and the Green Party on their success.”SympathyMs O’Sullivan welcomed the news that Sinn Féin had abandoned the potential recount and said she felt sympathy for Ms Ní Riada, who she said had represented Ireland well in the European Parliament following her election in 2014.“It’s ended very well but I am quite sad in a way for Liadh Ní Riada - it must be very difficult for her this evening...I had wished that she would be going to Europe along with myself, but that’s not going to happen now,” she said.Ms Ní Riada told Nuacht TG4 that while she was disappointed not to have retained her seat, she was particularly disappointed for her staff who had worked hard for her and for the people of Gaeltacht areas who would now be left without a voice in the European Parliament.Fine Gael’s Seán Kelly was the first person elected in Ireland South and was followed by Fianna Fáil TD Billy Kelleher. Counting will resume on Wednesday to decide the order in which the remaining seats are filled. Independents4Change TD Mick Wallace is expected to take the third seat when Ms Ní Riada’s 98,379 papers are distributed following her elimination. This would leave sitting Fine Gael MEP Deirdre Clune and Ms O’Sullivan battling it out for the fourth and fifth seats. All other candidates have been eliminated. Twelve counties ning from Wexford to Kerry make up the European election constituency of Ireland South, which has been allocated an additional seat in this election as a consequence of the UK’s decision to leave the EU.The order in which the seats are filled is important as the final seat in the constituency only comes into play once, or if, Brexit happens.Ms O’Sullivan said she was hopeful transfers would fall her way and help her avoid the “uncertainty” of ending up in the fifth seat. “Mick Wallace still has to be elected but I would hope to do well from Liadh Ní Riada’s votes when they are distributed and Deirdre Clune is still in fourth position, which is the seat I would like to take as the fifth seat is really a seat of uncertainty given it only becomes active when the UK leaves the EU.”Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeDonald Trump visit: President pays tribute to Theresa May before enjoying dinner with Prince Charles and Camilla - live updatesEverything we know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s state visit to BritainDrug which helps woman survive breast cancer can also stop prostate cancer spreading in men, new study findsDonald Trump\u0026#39s gifts: Air Force One bomber jacket for Prince Philip and a brooch for the QueenJihadi Jack\u0026#39s mother claims she tried to offer him £5,000 \u0026#39bribe\u0026#39 to encourage him to leave SyriaBoris Johnson warns delaying Brexit again will mean \u0026#39extinction\u0026#39 for Tory Party as he pitches to be next PMCall Andrea!

The computer itself had received rapturous reactions of cheers and applause – but the crowd was very quiet when the price of the stand was announced.The stand is intended for the new Mac Pro, the most powerful computer Apple has ever made.As with previous versions of that computer, it comes in a modular design. The computer itself is a customisable tower, but it has to be plugged in to a display to actually see anything.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

While customers can pay less to have the display attached to a wall, standing it up on a desk requires buying the accessory, which costs nearly as much as an entire MacBook.During Apple\u0027s presentation, it stressed that the stand comes with a range of different features. It is made entirely of metal, for instance, and can swing and move so that it can easily move into a portrait mode or swivel around.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In fact you could just look at the title, “Tipping Point”, an apt summation of where the UK is at thanks to the efforts of Fox and his disreputable friends.\u0026nbspThe report shows that the UK experienced a 13 per cent decline in FDI projects in 2018 against a 4 per cent decline across the rest of Europe. The UK’s share of all European projects slipped to 17 per cent. That’s the lowest level in two decades.\u0026nbspThe decline in manufacturing investment was particularly notable - it recorded a stunning 35 per cent fall.\u0026nbspBut the digital side is great, right? They\u0027re gagging to invest in that, and digital is, of course, the future!\u0026nbspThing is, even in that sector the figures are nothing like as rosy as Fox portrays them.\u0026nbspThe report says the UK’s market share in this area fell\u0026nbspto 23 per cent. This\u0026nbspshouldn’t come as a surprise to Fox and his colleagues. EY first flagged signs of a challenge to the UK’s leadership last year when its 27 per cent growth was significantly behind the 33 per cent recorded across the continent as a whole.\u0026nbspCare to take a stab at what’s causing figures that a responsible government (I know, I know) ought to be deeply concerned about? It’s pushing it to award a gold star to those who said Brexit because it’s screamingly obvious, as the report makes clear.\u0026nbspUnlike Fox, I’m going to be honest with\u0026nbspthe numbers. EY asked a panel of 400 investors about the impact of that godawful mess he played a major role in creating and 5 per cent said they had cut their investment. However,\u0026nbspthat was counterbalanced by 5 per cent increasing it. Where’s the problem then? Some 15 per cent had put their plans to hold, double the previous year.\u0026nbspThe investment, jobs, future prosperity etc,\u0026nbspis still available for the UK. But EY says that it will “require engagement with investors to address their concerns” before it is released.\u0026nbspThe farce of a Tory leadership battle currently taking place isn’t going to help with that, nor is the fact that the front runner is Boris Johnson, a man, remember, who infamously once said “f**k business”.\u0026nbspFox is correct that the UK has proven attractive to investors from the US. But his highlighting that glosses over yet another troubling finding by EY: It performed badly with most of the other main sources of investment cash, notably the fast growing economies that Fox and his “global Britain” pals say will pour in to replace what is lost through severing the link between us and our former friends and allies across the channel.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour Party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the Industrial Revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three-quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fund shrunk by £600m in just the last month, including £187m withdrawn by customers with the rest made up by the tumbling value of its investments.A request to withdraw £250m by Kent County Council led to all withdrawals to be suspended on Monday for at least four weeks to “protect” investors, Mr Woodford’s firm said.It marks a new nadir for a man feted in the City as someone who could consistently deliver big returns for large numbers of retail investors.Mr Woodford has commanded multimillion-pound pay packages over the years, including the £37m he shared with his firm’s chief executive Craig Newman in January despite a dismal year.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti-Donald Trump protesters gather with a Trump baby blimp flying over Parliament Square for a protest against the US president\u0027s state visit to the UKQueen Elizabeth II views a display of US items of the Royal collection with US President Donald Trump and US First Lady Melania Trump at Buckingham palaceLiverpool\u0027s players celebrate with the Champions League trophy on board a parade bus after winning the final against Tottenham Hotspur, in Madrid the night beforeFans gather in Madrid ahead of the all-English club Champions League Final between Tottenham and LiverpoolRacegoers during Ladies Day of the 2019 Investec Derby Festival at Epsom Racecourse, Epsom.Jofra Archer celebrates taking the wicket of South Africa\u0027s Aiden Markram during England\u0027s opening ICC Cricket World Cup match at the Kia Oval in London.

We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford’s multi-decade track record remains compelling – but we don’t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford’s recent performance.“The suspension is understandably frustrating, but it’s important to remember that the value of your investment will be dependent on the share prices of the portfolio’s underlying holdings, which are not directly impacted by the suspension.”Mr Woodford\u0026nbsphas faced criticism because of some of his\u0026nbspinvestments in unlisted stocks are riskier and harder to trade, making them more difficult to manage in a fund where investors have the right to withdraw their money daily.Hedge funds run by women outperforming those run by men, data showsQuestions will be raised as to whether Mr Woodford’s\u0026nbspfund was a suitable investment for a local authority such as Kent County Council.The City watchdog said it was in contact with\u0026nbspWoodford\u0026nbspInvestment Management “to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund’s investors”.Daniel Godfrey, an adviser to fund management groups, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Mr Woodford was “one of the finest fund managers that Britain’s ever produced, although clearly he is having a dark and terrible moment.”He believes Mr Woodford could bounce back. “There could be a new dawn and it’s not necessarily the end,” he said.“It’s clearly a very dark and difficult moment for Neil Woodford and his business and there may well have to be a hit to valuations to get rid of some of the unlisted holdings. But from there it’ll still be probably a reasonably big fund.“It could well be the case that in five years’ time, we’re looking at it and anyone who bought when it reopens will have had a great performance.”Woodford Investment Management said: “After consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the Fund’s assets, we have ... come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of all investors in the fund to suspend the issue, cancellation, sale, redemption and transfer of shares in the fund.“Following an increased level of redemptions, this period of suspension is intended to protect the investors in the fund by allowing Woodford, as previously communicated to investors, time to reposition the element of the fund’s portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Commercial building was worst-hit, with firms reporting the steepest fall since September 2017.Civil engineering work was also depleted, with May’s fall marking the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013.Meanwhile, housebuilding was the only area where output increased, though growth was softer than last year’s average.Purchasing activity also declined, recording its largest fall since September 2017.Amid the gloom in the sector, business confidence levels slumped to a seven-month low.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said it was concerning to see forward-looking measures such as new order numbers weaken.“The delay of Brexit until a flexible deadline of 31 October\u0026nbsp– and current major uncertainties over what will happen then – is worrying for construction companies as it threatens to prolong uncertainty and fuel an ongoing reluctance of clients to commit to major construction projects, particularly in the commercial sector as well as infrastructure.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It may not be down to their university.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, the regulator for the higher education sector, told The Independent: “There are a number of avenues students can pursue if they are not satisfied with the quality of the teaching they receive or other aspects of their course.“It may well be that students raising concerns and complaints either informally or formally can bring about changes, but clearly it is important that students are able to escalate these concerns if a resolution cannot be found.”Last week, a government-commissioned review suggested that tuition fees should be cut to £7,500.An NUS spokesperson said: “The Augar\u0026nbspreview confirmed that fees are too high, and accepted that students are accruing unsustainable levels of debt within the current system. It is little surprise this affects their perception of value for money.“Students do have clear rights under law, and the report of the settlement does indicate a way students can seek recourse.”Last year, the County Court of Central London ruled in the university’s favour and ordered Ms Wong to pay £13,700 of Anglia Ruskin’s legal costs.\u0026nbspBut the university’s insurers wrote to the former student following the hearing, without reference to the university, offering to settle her £15,000 claim, plus the payment of her legal costs.A statement from Anglia Ruskin University said: “We do not support their decision and have informed them that we consider that they acted negligently and against the university’s interests.”Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International, said: “The vast majority of students have a positive experience and the UK ranks number one in the world for international student satisfaction, with 91 per cent\u0026nbspsatisfaction.“All universities in the UK are regularly reviewed by the Quality Assurance Agency. To be a registered university in the UK, an institution must provide a high-quality experience for students. This means that all UK universities offer a very high standard of education.She added: Universities provide students with the tools and experiences they need to be successful but cannot guarantee a particular career path: students have a responsibility to work hard and take initiative.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour Party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the Industrial Revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three-quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So will the third and second generations of the iPad Mini, and every iPod Touch before the one that Apple just released.Apple announces launch for new iPhone and iPad softwareSome had feared that the iPhone SE, which was released in 2016 and proved to be a huge and unexpected success, could also be excluded from the update. But it will still be able to use iOS 13, Apple said.Not every phone will get access to every new feature in the software update. For instance, Apple spent some time talking about the updates to its Memoji characters – which allow people to make cartoon versions of themselves and use them in messages and elsewhere – but they require the A9 chip to work, which first came with the iPhone 6s.The company did not say which features or changes meant that the older devices would be unable to keep up.Last year, Apple said that every iPhone that could support iOS 11 would also get iOS 12. But that update focused on performance improvements and stability, with this year\u0027s update bringing more brand new features that presumably rely on more processing power.The new update will arrive in the autumn, Apple said, though users can sign up to get hold of an early test version next month. Developers can download the software now – though Apple has advised them that they may be best not to.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But over that time it also became widely mocked for being slow and bloated, as Apple added more and more features.Now iTunes is dead, Apple has announced, and will be replaced by inidual apps for its various functions. It will instead have a music app, a podcast one and a TV app, it said.The Music app looks largely similar to the old iTunes app. But it removes all of the features that were not supporting music, instead focusing on songs, either stored locally or through Apple\u0027s own streaming service.Apple has been looking to encourage its users to sign up to its streaming services, which currently include Apple Music and will soon bring TV too.Created with Sketch.

Songs inside the app are unlikely to disappear, but it is unclear whether users will still be able to buy new ones.The company made the announcement while making a series of jokes, during which it poked fun at its history of adding a series of different features to iTunes and gradually making it more bloated and slow. Software head Craig Federighi suggested it would add a calendar and email clients to the app – before saying that the truth was they would be getting rid of the app entirely.All of the changes will come in the new version of\u0026nbspMacOS, named Catalina, which will be released later this year.The death of iTunes as one of the first things that Apple revealed about the new software, before it pointed to the entirely new and separate versions of the apps that will replace it.\u0026nbsp“With macOS Catalina, we’re bringing fresh new apps to the Mac, starting with new standalone versions of Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and the Apple TV app,” said Mr Federighi said in a statement. “Users will appreciate how they can expand their workspace with Sidecar, enabling new ways of interacting with Mac apps using iPad and Apple Pencil. And with new developer technologies, users will see more great third-party apps arrive on the Mac this fall.”Some had worried about how the Mac would continue to sync with iPhones or iPads without using iTunes. But Apple said that would be handled by MacOS itself, with options showing in the finder menu rather than in the iTunes app.Apple reveals new Mac Pro, its most powerful computer everThat will include other features such as the ability to use an iPad as a second display for your Mac.It also brings a new technology called Project Catalyst, which will allow developers to turn their iPad apps into Mac apps. It is not clear whether the new versions of Music, Podcasts and TV – which look similar to their equivalents on iOS –\u0026nbspwere written using these same technologies.Apple made the announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference, its biggest software event at the year.

Patrick Cockburn sounds out the localsClick to followThe IndependentThe River Wye flows through Herefordshire, which is more ‘feudal’ than neighbouring counties. Many big landowners ‘are the same as a hundred years ago’Herefordshire, a county of apple blossom and wild daffodils overlooked by the dark Welsh hills, is England’s arcadia. Its landscape inspired the magical land of Narnia according to CS\u0026nbspLewis. Its ancient gnarled oaks were the reputed model for the Ents, the fabulous trees that walk through the woods and talk to hobbits and wizards in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFor anybody in search of an idyllic pastoral England, Herefordshire appears to be the right place to come. Everything is on a human scale, from the small cathedral city of Hereford with a population of 70,000, to the scattering of towns, villages, and hamlets filled with black-and-white timber frame houses. For those seeking signs of a more robust England, recalling heroic battlefields from Agincourt to Arnhem, there is the comforting presence of the SAS headquarters on the outskirts of Hereford. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people living here do not relish change for understandable reasons and regret the changes in Britain since the country entered the EU a half century ago. “There is a lot of nostalgia in Herefordshire,” says local historian David Whitehead. He notes that local newspapers like to run two-page spreads of old photographs of the county in the inter-war period when life appeared to be more stable and predictable. “People feel closer to the past here than in most of England,” he says.A feeling that Britain should not abandon a successful tradition of standing on its own is particularly strong in this county, which voted to leave the EU by 59 to 41 per cent in the referendum of 2016, a result which was confirmed by the outcome of the EU parliamentary election on 24 May.Brexit voters are a broad coalition of different and often contradictory interests, held together by a conviction that the EU is the cause of their troubles. The grouping includes well-off farmers, fed up with bureaucracy but happy to receive substantial\u0026nbspsubsidies, retirees in bucolic villages, and those “left behind”\u0026nbspor “left out”\u0026nbspfor whom Britain’s EU years have brought insecure ill-paying jobs, housing too expensive to buy, and a flood of immigrants.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beauty and tranquillity of Herefordshire are deceptive: polarisation over Brexit is as deep here as in Islington or Sunderland. Dr Nick Meyer, a retired GP in Ledbury in the east of the county, replied to a question about political isions by saying he was planning on the following weekend to go on a boat trip with four friends, three of whom, including himself, were staunch Remainers and the fourth a committed Leave supporters. The Remainers had wondered if they should leave their friend behind to avoid rancorous disputes, but had finally decided to include him in the hope that they might change his mind during the sailing trip.“Brexit is very destructive in the way it has created a ided Britain,” says Dr Meyer. “Feeling about it is much stronger than it is between those supporting different political parties.”The level of anxiety over Brexit is no less than in metropolitan Britain. Tom Tibbets, who two years ago started a craft cider making business, says that he suffers acutely from Brexit related worries. “I have stress-related alopecia, which means that my hair is falling out,” he says, leaning forward to show a depleted but still substantial mop of dark hair. “According to my doctor this is all stress related.”Herefordshire is more “feudal” than neighbouring counties\u0026nbspand Whitehead says that many big landowners “are the same as a hundred years ago”.\u0026nbspHe says that much of the land between Ross-on-Wye in the south and Hereford in the north belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, a purchase they made in the 1950s.Overall, however, \u0026nbspHerefordshire is an impoverished county with few jobs for young people, who go elsewhere for work, while well-off professionals from London and Birmingham buy local houses for half the price they would pay at home. “It is an underdeveloped county with poor roads, social services, buses and schools,” says Dr Meyer, who has worked in Herefordshire as a doctor for 30 years.In Herefordshire, as in the rest of Britain, it is easy to discover the reasons why people want Britain to stay in the EU: they make concrete arguments about the economically disastrous consequences of leaving. But Brexiters have a different set of priorities revolving around the supposed threat to Britain’s independence as a nation state by power-hungry bureaucrats in Brussels and other continental capitals. This argument is buttressed by compelling if dubious claims that the EU has for years been bleeding Britain financially and, once out, we will get the money back. \u0026nbspJohn Forsyth is one of many former SAS soldiers who has stayed in Herefordshire and works as a health and safety consultant. He says he voted as a young soldier in the 1975 referendum in favour of membership of the Common Market, but he was dismayed to find that “it has evolved towards a state of Europe”. He sees the EU as corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic: “The reason I want to leave is that I see the EU as this inflexible bureaucratic monstrosity. We would do better to look after our own interests and be able to change our own laws.” He believes that that the referendum did lead to an upsurge in racism, to which he is much opposed, and agrees that Britain has been politically polarised by Brexit, though he believes this will disappear \u0026nbspin time.He does not use the word ‘self-determination’ but his views are very similar to those of nationalists the world over, from the American fighting for independence in the 18th century to the Irish and Indians in the 20th. In all cases, there was a natural desire by people to control their own lives and a tendency to blame all their ills on the British government. Many of the criticisms were justified but scapegoating contains hidden dangers, whether the target is London or Brussels, because it means that those seeking to break free from a detested central authority do not have to devise practical policies of their own. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEven so, it is strange to hear farmers in Herefordshire say they voted to leave the EU when they have benefited immensely from its subsidies. “The county voted massively for Brexit, but the people who are going to lose from Brexit are the farmers,” says James Marsden, an environmentalist who formerly worked for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The most important of these is “the basic payment scheme of £205 per hectare, which is paid not on what you do, but on how much land you own.” He says that outside the EU the smaller farmers will inevitably go the wall unless, as the Defra minister Michael Gove proposed last year, subsidies are in future geared to farmers cultivating the land in an environmentally friendly way.Ents, in Tolkien’s ‘Lord of the Rings’\u0026nbsp(Alamy)For now the reverse is happening: Marsden pointed through the windows of the house where we were talking at the pretty-looking cider apple orchard where the uniform rows of bush-sized trees were in full bloom. “What we are looking at,” he said, “is an intensely managed monoculture: the trees are not managed by hand but by machinery they are sprayed four times a year there are herbicidal patches beneath the trees. From the point of view of ersity, you might as well be growing rape seed or grain.”\u0026nbspOverall, Brexit will have two contradictory consequences for the rural environment: it will help preserve it because there will be fewer\u0026nbspfarmers, but will also damage it because those who stay in business – the larger ones with more capital to buy new machinery - will exploit it more intensively unless they are tightly regulated. He says small hill farmers in Wales, where he works part of the time, are highly conscious that they are facing extinction post-Brexit, but “in my parish in Herefordshire, they are still in denial”.Some are, in fact, deeply worried about their future. Owen Whittall \u0026nbspfarms cattle, sheep and mixed crops on 800 acres and is conflicted about Brexit. “I remember the morning of the referendum. My wife voted ‘in’ and I voted ‘out’ and I was not a happy person. I felt very uneasy with my decision and I am still not happy.”He thinks that many of the smaller farmers will not survive outside the EU unless they get a second job, intensify their farming, or accept a lower standard of living. He says with some scorn that a lot of well-paid professional people from the cities will be “buying idyllic little farms with a few Hereford and Dexter cattle and doing the lifestyle thing”.Dr Meyer, the Ledbury GP, says: “It will be disastrous for the farming community, but most farmers I know were for Brexit.” He says that one important reason for this was the EU’s bureaucratic hoops that even fervent Remainers confirm are fearsomely difficult. Tom Tibbets, the cider-maker who campaigned against Brexit, says he knows from personal experience that even moving a pig to the abattoir for personal consumption requires endless time-consuming paperwork. On the other hand, once these bureaucratic hurdles are negotiated, the flat rate subsidy is paid without further effort. Farmers do not volunteer what they get\u0026nbspbut one, on a medium-sized farm, said they were getting £30,000 a year.This is all very different from Narnia. Julian Whitmarsh, who owns the “Jules” restaurant’ in the picture post card village of Weobley, has a caustic take on social developments in rural Herefordshire. “Agriculture has ceased to be a craft and has become an industry,” he says. “It employs fewer and fewer people because the big farms that once employed eight workers now employ one.” He complains that villages are full of people who have sold their houses in the cities and “put on green wellies and are playing at Ambridge” (the fictional village in The Archers, the long-running BBC radio soap opera on rural life).His explanation as to why so many people in Herefordshire voted against their own best interests is that they are instinctively right wing and badly informed. Then there are the newspapers on which they rely for information about the EU and everything else in the world. He says: “The Daily Mail sells 50 copies every morning in Weobley and The Daily  almost as many copies. while there are about five who buy  and quite a few of us buy the i.”\u0026nbsp The strong Liberal Democrat and Green vote in the European parliamentary election in Herefordshire does not quite confirm this picture of right wing domination, but it sounds broadly correct.Not all agriculture is industrialised. Cider apples can be shaken loose and hoovered up by machine, but not eating apples, blue berries or strawberries which must be picked by hand. Workers are still needed to do the dirty jobs in the poultry units that are springing up all over the county. Such jobs have been done hitherto by a great influx of foreign labour from Eastern Europe who not only work as pickers or pruners but as vets in the abattoirs and managers in the hotels. Farmers say that this labour force, on which they depend, is in increasingly short supply because of fears of Brexit, the low value of the pound and improved economies in Poland, Hungry and elsewhere.Corbyn is right – only a general election can unite Leave and RemainRemain parties must ditch tribalism and work to stop a no-deal BrexitRenewable energy lets consumers save money and the planetIf sugar is killing us, why does Britain farm so much of it?Esther Rudge, a fourth generation farmer, worries about whether or not she will be able to go on getting the 30 foreign labourers, mostly Poles, whom she has formerly employed to pick her eating apples. Others face greater problems which they may be slow to appreciate: she and her husband have friends “who employ 1,000 foreign workers but still voted Leave”.An even greater threat facing British farming is the prospect that, after a no-deal Brexit, a British government might be desperate for a trade deal with the United States. The price for this might be the opening up of the British market to cheap American farm produce. “Agriculture could be the sacrificial lamb,” Rudge believes, “so you would get cheap beef and chicken coming into the country.” Even without such a deal, she fears that a British crash out of the EU leading to trade on WTO rules would ruin the British livestock industry.Some commentators have compared the prospects for British farming after Brexit as being like playing Russian roulette, but with only one chamber of the revolver unloaded. Others, with long experience of farming in the region,\u0026nbsphave a less cataclysmic but still gloomy view of the prospects for farmers. Francis Chester-Master, a landowner and land agent, gives a summary of the prospects with or without Brexit.Chester-Master says that what is most damaging for rural Britain is the continued uncertainty over whether or not Britain will leave the EU. But this uncertainty may not be a temporary problem supposing Brexit occurs. Rudge, who runs a successful medium-sized farm, says that outside the EU Britain “will be a small fish in a large pool” and small fish necessarily live day to day at the mercy of forces they do not control. Old certainties are evaporating and nobody can predict what will take their place.\u0026nbsp The farmers of Hereford – and in the rest of Britain – have deepened the uncertainties they were seeking to escape.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only one couple will take home the cash prize.Among this year’s 12 hopefuls (though there will be many more) are a beauty therapist, a semi-pro rugby player, and a ballroom dancer.\u0026nbspAs usual, Caroline Flack will take on presenting duties.Here are the biggest talking points from episode one, and you can also check out our live blog as the show happened below.\u0026nbspWith every new series of Love Island,\u0026nbspa few new catchphrases\u0026nbspemerge. Last year, of course, there was “loyal”, “sort”, “pied off”, etc. But no one has ever tried so hard to make a catchphrase happen as Lucie, who just one episode in\u0026nbspis already uttering the word “bev” approximately every six seconds. Please stop, Lucie. Nobody understands what you mean.He may yet surprise us, but all early signs points towards Anton being this year’s Adam, AKA a terrible human being. Already, he has gone behind Amy’s back to try and persuade Lucie, despite her expressly stating her lack of interest, that she does, in fact, fancy him. Not to mention the fact that a picture emerged, before tonight’s episode even aired, of the 24-year-old wearing blackface.Accusations of racial biasAnton’s heinous photo is not the only race-related issue surrounding the show. Former contestant Marcel Somerville tweeted to point out the frequency with which black contestants were picked last. “This is mad!!!! #LoveIsland flash backs! Black guy, black girl and mixed race guy all left unpicked. Mad!!!” This isn’t the first time this has been raised either. Last year, contestant Samira Mighty was oft-overlooked – though it’s a depressing bias that exists in the real world too: in 2014, according to Gal-Dem magazine, the dating website OkCupid found that black women received the fewest messages out of all its users.Two new contestantsThere’s no rest for the wicked on Love Island. Just as everyone had been (un)happily coupled up, two new men arrived – Curtis and Tommy, the latter of whom is boxer Tyson Fury’s brother, and is built, as the actor Dax Shepard would put it, like a brick s**t house. No doubt he’ll be the cause of much heartache, mugging and pieing (sp?) in the weeks to come. \u0026nbspRead our live blog for all the updates on the\u0026nbspfirst episode as it happened.Meet the 12 contestants heading into the Love Island villaWhy it\u0027s time to stop hate-watching Love IslandThis year\u0027s line-up is considerably more erse than it has been in previous years. When I was on Love Island, there was a lot about me being the only dark skinned girl, said last year\u0027s contestant Samira Mighty. I think it would be great to see a lot more races in there.A lot has been made, too, of the inclusion of Iranian Instagram star Anna Vikili,\u0026nbspwho has been dubbed, by some,\u0026nbspthe show\u0027s first plus-size contender. Actor and body image campaigner Jameela Jamil begs to differ. The producers of Love Island think this slim woman counts as their new token \u0027plus size\u0027 contestant? she tweeted. Are they drunk?This year\u0027s Love Island has some big shoes to fill.\u0026nbspThe 2018 edition was the most popular programme in ITV2\u0027s history, with\u0026nbsp4.3 million people tuning\u0026nbspin to the final episode to root for Dani and Jack. (Don\u0027t tell us you wanted Megan and Wes to win.)Just a few minutes left of Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them\u0026nbspon ITV2, and then it\u0027s Love Island time. No offence to him, but Newt Scamander probably wouldn\u0027t make it past week one.\u0026nbspAs with last year’s series, new episodes will be broadcast six days a week.

At other times, parts of the surface mysteriously go dark.Scientists have not been able to work out why the strange changes in light are happening. That is despite them being observed for decades, and being catalogued in scientific papers as far back as the 1950s.Scientists refer to them as transient lunar phenomena. One paper in 1970 described how the emitted light is usually described as reddish or pinkish, sometimes with a \u0027sparkling\u0027 or \u0027flowing\u0027 appearance, noting that they stretched for miles across the surface and usually lasted for 20 minutes but could go on for hours.They have suggested various explanations, such as the Moon being hit by meteors or the solar wind hitting moon dust, or movement of the Moon\u0027s surface that lets out gases that reflect sunlight back at the Earth. But no decisive explanation of the behaviour has been offered.Now they hope to finally understand what is causing the strange flashes on the\u0026nbspsurface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

It uses two cameras to watch the moon after night, and when they both see one of the flashes, the telescope captures photos and videos and alerts Professor Kayal\u0027s team for further observation.The team then hope to share those results with the European Space Agency, with the aim of cataloguing the events and trying to understand what seems to be making them happen.Learning about the Moon\u0027s surface\u0026nbspin this way could prove key as countries including the US, China and India all hope to head to the Moon and stay there.\u0026nbspAnyone who wants to build a lunar base at some point must of course be familiar with the local conditions, sad Professor Kayal in a statement.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fund shrunk by £600m in just the last month, including £187m withdrawn by customers with the rest made up by the tumbling value of its investments.A request to withdraw £250m by Kent County Council led to all withdrawals to be suspended on Monday for at least four weeks to “protect” investors, Mr Woodford’s firm said.It marks a new nadir for a man feted in the City as someone who could consistently deliver big returns for large numbers of retail investors.Mr Woodford has commanded multimillion-pound pay packages over the years, including the £37m he shared with his firm’s chief executive Craig Newman in January despite a dismal year.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti-Donald Trump protesters gather with a Trump baby blimp flying over Parliament Square for a protest against the US president\u0027s state visit to the UKQueen Elizabeth II views a display of US items of the Royal collection with US President Donald Trump and US First Lady Melania Trump at Buckingham palaceLiverpool\u0027s players celebrate with the Champions League trophy on board a parade bus after winning the final against Tottenham Hotspur, in Madrid the night beforeFans gather in Madrid ahead of the all-English club Champions League Final between Tottenham and LiverpoolRacegoers during Ladies Day of the 2019 Investec Derby Festival at Epsom Racecourse, Epsom.Jofra Archer celebrates taking the wicket of South Africa\u0027s Aiden Markram during England\u0027s opening ICC Cricket World Cup match at the Kia Oval in London.

We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford’s multi-decade track record remains compelling – but we don’t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford’s recent performance.“The suspension is understandably frustrating, but it’s important to remember that the value of your investment will be dependent on the share prices of the portfolio’s underlying holdings, which are not directly impacted by the suspension.”Mr Woodford\u0026nbsphas faced criticism because of some of his\u0026nbspinvestments in unlisted stocks are riskier and harder to trade, making them more difficult to manage in a fund where investors have the right to withdraw their money daily.Hedge funds run by women outperforming those run by men, data showsQuestions will be raised as to whether Mr Woodford’s\u0026nbspfund was a suitable investment for a local authority such as Kent County Council.The City watchdog said it was in contact with\u0026nbspWoodford\u0026nbspInvestment Management “to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund’s investors”.Daniel Godfrey, an adviser to fund management groups, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Mr Woodford was “one of the finest fund managers that Britain’s ever produced, although clearly he is having a dark and terrible moment.”He believes Mr Woodford could bounce back. “There could be a new dawn and it’s not necessarily the end,” he said.“It’s clearly a very dark and difficult moment for Neil Woodford and his business and there may well have to be a hit to valuations to get rid of some of the unlisted holdings. But from there it’ll still be probably a reasonably big fund.“It could well be the case that in five years’ time, we’re looking at it and anyone who bought when it reopens will have had a great performance.”Woodford Investment Management said: “After consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the Fund’s assets, we have ... come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of all investors in the fund to suspend the issue, cancellation, sale, redemption and transfer of shares in the fund.“Following an increased level of redemptions, this period of suspension is intended to protect the investors in the fund by allowing Woodford, as previously communicated to investors, time to reposition the element of the fund’s portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unions also complain of deteriorating factory conditions and increasing pressure to be more productive.\u0026nbspItalian-owned Ferrero said it is trying to protect workers who aren\u0027t on strike, and wants to resume dialogue – but not until the workers stop blocking the factory.\u0026nbspThe next negotiation meeting is scheduled for 13 June.\u0026nbspFrench workers frequently go on strike during salary negotiations and occasionally resort to more dramatic methods. The last strike to hit the Villers-Ecalles factory was in 2011.\u0026nbspThe action comes amid anger among many low-income French workers at pro-business policies by President Emmanuel Macron seen as favoring the rich — and that prompted the yellow vest protest movement.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” According to\u0026nbspDeadline,\u0026nbspKamp Koral\u0026nbspfollows a young SpongeBob as he conducts various activities with his friends at sleepaway camp, including swimming and jellyfish hunting.The animated series\u0026nbspSpongeBob SquarePants, created by Stephen Hillenburg, premiered in the US on 17 July, 1999.It has since acquired a massive fan following\u0026nbspand spawned two films (The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\u0026nbspin 2004 and\u0026nbspThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\u0026nbspin 2015).A third movie,\u0026nbspThe SpongeBob Movie: It\u0027s a Wonderful Sponge, will be released in 2020.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group Extinction Rebellion is calling for a week of civil disobedience against what it says is the failure to tackle the causes of climate changeExtinction Rebellion demonstrators camp near Marble Arch, London, as more than 100 people have been arrested as police deal with ongoing climate change protestsThe Welsh government ordered a £44m public inquiry into the project, and a report by planning inspector Bill Wadrup, made public this week, backed the plans, saying it would provide good value for money.But in his decision letter, released\u0026nbspshortly after the report\u0027s publication, Mr Drakeford said his cabinet had already decided in April not to back the project because of demands on the Welsh government’s budgets and its financial position.\u0026nbspHe said\u0026nbspthe cost involved “was not acceptable”.CardyGetty Images)He added that\u0026nbspthe allocation of government funds was “beyond the scope of the public inquiry” and not a matter on which the inspector should comment.Mr Drakeford also said he attached “greater weight” to the effects that the road would have on the environment than the inspector had.“In particular, I attach very significant weight to the fact that the project would have a substantial adverse impact on the Gwent Levels SSSIs and their green network and wildlife, and on other species, and a permanent adverse impact on the historic landscape of the Gwent Levels, he added.“As a result, in my judgment, the project’s adverse impacts on the environment (taken together with its other disadvantages) outweigh its advantages.”Welsh Conservatives said the decision was a “kick in the teeth” for commuters and that Welsh Labour had “poured millions of pounds down the drain in completing the inquiry, only to ignore its findings”.Conservative assembly member Russell George said: “Congestion on this road is a foot on the windpipe of the south Wales economy, and is damaging our businesses and their future prospects.”Man who drove for 10 miles on M4 into oncoming traffic arrested Brexit or no Brexit, for many in south Wales life offers few prospectsHow South Wales is learning from community forests in ScotlandPlane crashes onto A40 dual carriageway in WalesHeather Myers, chief executive of South and Mid Wales Chamber of Commerce, said it and the business community it represented were “bitterly disappointed”, while a joint statement from the Cardiff Capital Region City deal said southeast Wales would become “paralysed by an ageing transport infrastructure operating beyond capacity”.But Friends of the Earth Cymru said the decision was “great news for Wales and the planet”.The environmental organisation said: “As well as costing Welsh taxpayers over £2bn, this devastating road would have ploughed through the unique, wildlife-rich Gwent Levels, pumped more climate-wrecking emissions into our atmosphere, and ultimately caused even more congestion and air pollution.”Press Association contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The MPs will sit as independents in the House of Commons.Ms Allen was joined by Chuka Umunna, Sarah Wollaston, Gavin Shuker, Angela Smith and Luciana Berger. In a joint statement the six said they would be “supporting each other as an independent grouping”.The split leaves Anna ​Soubry, Chris Leslie, Joan Ryan, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey as the only remaining Change UK MPs.Ms\u0026nbspSoubry, the former Conservative MP, has been elected as leader of the remaining\u0026nbspgroup.Why Change UK did so badly in the European electionsSpeaking after a crisis meeting that confirmed\u0026nbspthe group would split, she said:\u0026nbsp“I’m deeply disappointed that at such a crucial time in British politics our former colleagues have made this decision. Now is not the time to walk away, but instead to roll up our sleeves and stand up for the sensible mainstream centre ground which is unrepresented in British politics today.\u0026nbspMs Soubry said the MPs felt a responsibility to Change UK’s 100,000 registered supporters and the near\u0026nbsp600,000 people who voted for the party in last month’s EU elections “to stand up for those who feel the established parties do not represent them and who want a different choice and to change our broken politics”.Ms Allen said: “We believe that our priority right now must be to provide collegiate leadership to bring people together in the national interest. We know the landscape will continue to shift within the political environment and have concluded that by returning to sit as independents, we will be best placed to work cross party and respond\u0026nbspflexibly.”The departing MPs “wish our colleagues well as they continue to build Change UK”, she added.Created with Sketch.Which MPs defected to create Change UK?

Most importantly, the centre ground at the next general election must decide how we work together, in whatever form, instead of competing against each other. We need to regroup and consolidate activity to maximise our impact – a key lesson of the European elections.”He added: “I\u0026nbspam clear that there is currently not one single force in the Remain movement or in the centre ground that can stop Brexit or break the two-party system on its own.\u0026nbspThe movement built around Change UK has an important role to play in this.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I believe it should carry on as an organisation, I do not believe Change UK should carry on in its current form.\u0026nbspThis has put me in a fundamentally different place not only to other Change UK parliamentary colleagues but also it’s activists and candidates who should be free to take the party in the direction they wish.\u0026nbspConsequently, with a heavy heart, I have decided to leave the party and to return to sitting as an independent MP in the House of Commons for the time being.”Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said he would like the MPs to join his party but could also work with them in other ways. He told BBC News: “Most of the group are people who share the same values as we do. My door is open to talk with them, particularly the independent group, about their future. I don’t want to gloat over their failure. It was a failure. But we have got to move on and I want to be positive about it.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Commercial building was worst-hit, with firms reporting the steepest fall since September 2017.Civil engineering work was also depleted, with May’s fall marking the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013.Meanwhile, housebuilding was the only area where output increased, though growth was softer than last year’s average.Purchasing activity also declined, recording its largest fall since September 2017.Amid the gloom in the sector, business confidence levels slumped to a seven-month low.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said it was concerning to see forward-looking measures such as new order numbers weaken.“The delay of Brexit until a flexible deadline of 31 October\u0026nbsp– and current major uncertainties over what will happen then – is worrying for construction companies as it threatens to prolong uncertainty and fuel an ongoing reluctance of clients to commit to major construction projects, particularly in the commercial sector as well as infrastructure.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re taking the place!” they barked, barging their way through the double doors of 51 and 53 Christopher Street as the establishment’s patrons rolled their eyes in exasperation. Another shakedown.\u0026nbspThe bar, a well-known hangout for the city’s fledgling gay\u0026nbspcommunity, was an easy mark for corrupt officers.Dubbed “Lily Law” or “Betty Badge” by their prey, these officers could pick up a weekly payoff from the owners - the Genovese crime family - in exchange\u0026nbspfor turning\u0026nbspa blind eye to its serving drinks without a liquor licence and not leaking the names of influential customers to the press. The envelope of cash they pocketed in return for their compliance was known as “gayola”.The Stonewall Inn had once been a stable. It had\u0026nbspno running water to wash its glasses, no fire exit and the toilets frequently broke\u0026nbspbut it was a haven for the city’s outsiders, a sanctuary from a conservative state that considered their very existence a threat to public decency and national security and where dancing was permitted for a $3 entrance fee.Its clientele was mixed-race but primarily comprised of gay men, although some lesbians and homeless teens sleeping rough in nearby Christopher Park often visited, drawn to the inclusive party atmosphere within its walls, painted black.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.London Pride 2018: in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Getty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Barefoot WineGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Pride In LondonGetty Images for Barefoot WineGetty Images for Pride In LondonThe cops usually tipped off the bar before carrying out one of its semi-regular raids, but this time refrained.One theory was that the Stonewall Inn’s Mafia owners had begun extorting rich customers, particularly Wall Street traders, realising there was more money to be made from selling their silence than mixing drinks. Doing so, the theory goes, estranged the authorities from their kickbacks, prompting them to shutdown the bar permanently in revenge.Smythe, Pine and their plainclothes team walked in on a crowded dance floor of some 205 revellers that balmy summer night - which happened to follow the day\u0026nbspmusical star and gay icon Judy Garland had been laid to rest\u0026nbsp-\u0026nbspand barred the doors.But their attempts to line up and frisk those patrons they intended to take into custody met with unexpected resistance.\u0026nbspThe Stonewall’s cornered customers had simply had enough of being persecuted, refusing to hand over their ID cards or co-operate with officers seeking to verify the gender of cross-dressers, an intrusive and dehumanising routine.A lengthy delay\u0026nbspcaused by the authorities having to await the arrival of a wagon to collect the Inn’s seized alcohol stock allowed tensions to fester on Christopher Street, with anger mounting among the growing crowd of bystanders over the officers’ treatment of the bar’s lesbian patrons, some of whom they are said to have molested during searches.Suspected Mafia members were finally loaded into one wagon and arrested customers into another. Onlookers began to chant “Gay power!” and sing “We Shall Overcome”, booing when an officer shoved a transvestite and cheering when he was hit in the face with a purse in retaliation.\u0026nbspMatters finally came to a head when one woman – later named as\u0026nbspStorme\u0026nbspDeLarverie\u0026nbsp- complained about the tight handcuffs placed on her wrists and was beaten with a nightstick, prompting her to fight back against four officers and incite the crowd to come to her aid. The scene erupted.Activists Marsha P Johnson and\u0026nbspSylvia Rivera -\u0026nbsptrans women of colour, the former celebrating her 25th birthday that night – were among the first to throw bottles at the police before being joined by others throwing pennies and beer cans. What followed was a 45-minute melee, the crowd taking on the NYPD with rubbish bins, flaming garbage, cobblestones and bricks from a neighbouring construction site.The cops -\u0026nbspalong with folk singer Dave Van Ronk and Village Voice writer Howard Smith, who had both been compelled to investigate the chaos\u0026nbsp-\u0026nbspbarricaded themselves inside the Stonewall for their own safety, covering the windows with plywood planks, only for the doors to be charged in with a\u0026nbspparking meter\u0026nbsptorn out of the pavement for use as an impromptu battering ram.As the protesters broke in and the bartop\u0026nbspwas set on fire with lighter fluid,\u0026nbspa Tactical Police Force unit arrived to free their colleagues.They were greeted by a chorus line, its participants\u0026nbsplinking arms and kicking their legs in the air like Parisian cancan dancers.London to host its first Transgender Pride festival this yearWhen order was finally restored in the early hours of the morning, the Stonewall Inn had been completely trashed – its washroom, mirrors, jukeboxes and cigarette machines all destroyed. Thirteen people were arrested, four officers treated for injuries and many others hospitalised.The rioting resumed the following evening and for several nights after, by which point the bar had already become a focal point for anti-police unrest, its walls daubed with graffiti declaring “Drag power!” and “They invaded our rights!”.Johnson is said to have smashed a patrol car’s\u0026nbspwindshield by dropping her bag on it from the top of a lamppost as thousands took to the streets of Greenwich Village in defiant mood, rocking cars and rallying against a humiliated NYPD.Their point had been well and truly made.As Beat poet Allen Ginsberg put it:\u0026nbsp“Gay power! Isn’t that great! It’s about time we did something to assert ourselves... You know, the guys there were so beautiful – they’ve lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago.”In Stonewall’s immediate aftermath, the Gay Liberation Front and the less confrontational, more orderly Gay Activists Alliance were soon formed to organise rights activism while the newspapers Gay, Come Out! and Gay Power\u0026nbspentered publication, preaching empowerment.On the one year anniversary of the riots, marchers coordinated by activist Brenda Howard and others gathered in Manhattan – and at parallel events in Chicago and Los Angeles -\u0026nbspto celebrate “Christopher Street Liberation Day”, honouring the Stonewall riots and what had quickly been recognised as a watershed moment in LGBT+ rights. Gay Pride was born, with more and more cities across the world staging their own carnivals and street parades to champion gay, lesbian and trans culture.It took another 30 years before a US president, Bill\u0026nbspClinton, officially declared June “Gay and Lesbian Pride Month”. Fellow Democrat Barack Obama extended its title to the more inclusive “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month” in 2009.The Stonewall riots were both a spontaneous outburst of frustration and anger at the oppression of LGBT+ people and\u0026nbspvery much a product of their moment.Perhaps\u0026nbspthe most turbulent decade\u0026nbspin American history, the\u0026nbsp1960s\u0026nbsphad begun with a rush of counter-culture optimism but was spiralling towards disillusionment\u0026nbspby its close after the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Malcolm X and the Reverend Dr\u0026nbspMartin Luther King Jr\u0026nbspand the ever-more-futile sacrifice of young American\u0026nbsplife\u0026nbspin an unwinnable Vietnam War.\u0026nbspThe hippie dream would die\u0026nbspwith Charles Manson and Altamont\u0026nbspand the righteous anger of the Black Panthers\u0026nbspseemed like the only means left open for those determined to achieve the goals of the civil rights movement\u0026nbspand bring about meaningful social reform.The Stonewall fightback may have been chaotic but it was also exactly the sort of radical, authentic,\u0026nbspprovocative eruption the world needed to wake up to the rights and fundamental human dignity of citizens in America\u0026nbspand beyond who had suffered in the shadows for far too long.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But he’s not a violent gang member recounting his crimes – he’s a ten-year-old boy who’s been asked to imagine what could happen to him in a decade’s time.Kairon is one of the , primary school children at pupil referral unitsin England, set up to educate kids who’ve been kicked out of mainstream school.The Sun has lted the lid on the scandal of Britain’s rising number of ‘Unteachable’ kids - with permanent exclusions soaring by  per cent in just three years and up to , other children illegally off-rolled every year.Many end up in PRUs, and now we’ve been given rare access to one.In fact, of the dozens we asked to visit, Hawkswood Primary PRU in north-east London was the only one to allow us access. Kairon is one of up to  kids who attends the school.Although these are some of the most disruptive children in the school system – screaming, biting, headbutting and spitting are all commonplace – not a single one is abandoned by Hawkswood. Headteacher Marie Gentles refuses to exclude kids, no matter what they do.Her pupils are given hugs, never called naughty, and a red and yellow traffic light system teaches them about unacceptable behaviour.None of these techniques are ground-breaking, but they work - every Year Six student sat the recent SATs testsKairon was sent to Hawkswood a year ago and agrees the tactic works.They know how to make us feel happy,” he says.[My old school] didn’t really know how to handle me. I’d always run out of lesson... I used to throw chairs butI do that now they just keep me safe.Inspirational Marie estimates a quarter of the students risk being drawn into gangs – not surprising, as gang members are five-and-a-half times more likely to have been excluded from school than other kids.We’ve had a couple of children who have definitely been embroiled in a gang, she says.However, we have more children who are vulnerable to being groomed by a gang, that’s the big thing.The pupils are also almost all boys.We always have minimal girls, she adds. At the moment, we have no girls in the juniors at all and one girl in the infants.This isnt unusual for a PRU - for every girl, three boys are permanently excluded from school. But its the rare female pupils who are the hardest work.Just last year, BBC footage captured a screaming five-year-old girl spitting in a teachers face while being restrained by a technique known as safe holding at the unit.This technique, which is used as a last resort, involves trained staff applying pressure to youngsters bodies to stop their movement for their own and others safety.Youre showing them you can keep them emotionally and physically safe, Marie says. We’ve had children who, after a while, will say, Oh Miss, can you hold me like that please  We’ll say, We don’t have to hold you like that, we can just give you a hug.’Marie is adamant no child at her school will feel rejected, which is why she doesn’t exclude kids.“We had a child here who was new about two months ago and was acting out really violently, really big. He said ‘Are you going to send me home ’ she says.I said, we’re not sending you home, you might be trying to hurt us but we still like you. Within two weeks, he wasn’t displaying that behaviour anymore.As I walked into the PRU the doors locked behind me - a safety measure in case any children in fight or flight mode try to bolt.But inside all was quiet, and one little boy even ran to get me a chair.People are often surprised [by the calmness] but this is our expectation, says Marie.In the Year Six classroom I found Kairon and his four classmates, all from very dferent backgrounds, looking at the stories theyd written about themselves the day before.Theyd jumped  years into the future and imagined a series of events, including some horrible ones, happening to them .Kairons shocked me - gangs, drug dealing, guns, police chases, funerals - every sentence was riddled with tragedy.But his teacher, Leah Mwaniki, doesn’t shy away from discussing these issues with students., students excluded from school every day on average kids permanently excluded every day pupil referral unitsin England% of permanent exclusions are issued to children with special education needs % of excluded children get five good GCSEs they need to succeed% of children in PRUs are persistently absent% of kids are not in education, employment or training when they leave PRUs at % of children in PRUs are white British% of prisoners were suspended or temporarily excluded as kids% of children in young offender institutions have been excluded , primary school children aged between five and  who were in PRUs last year£.billion... how much experts say every year group of permanently excluded pupils will additionally cost the state in education, health, benefits and criminal justice costs“Gangs, kne crime, everything, we have to address, says Leah, who has worked at the unit for eight years after making the move from mainstream schools like Marie.“We’re not going to hide anything about drugs we’re going to speak about it because most of them, or some of them, are exposed to it.PRUs have become key targets for county lines gangs, who groom thousands of vulnerable youngsters to shuttle and sell Class A drugs.Marie, , says students as young as seven can be targeted: The children are so vulnerable that they don’t even know they’re being groomed.”Hawkswood teachers are trained to look out for the signs a student is being groomed: suddenly wearing new clothes, talking about money, or mentioning new names.Teachers go to extreme s to protect the kids too –a parents lets an older student travel to and from school by themselves, a teacher will take them to the bus stop the first few times.Safeguarding is absolutely paramount here, Marie says.Because Hawkswood is a short-term intervention, many students reintegrate back into mainstream education within  to  weeks, with most doing so successfully.Teachers are also careful not to call kids “naughty” or “bad”, instead focusing on why certain behaviours are unacceptable.As part of this, they have lessons on behaviour modication , to help them when they reintegrate.The rush to exclude is one of the greatest social injustices of our times, he says.It is our modern age’s equivalent of the Victorian workhouse. If left unchecked, this trend will create generations of forgotten children — and our society will pay a savage price for that cruelty.Mr Halfon has called on the Government to take radical action.A lot is expected of the kids but it seems to work.Marie is fiercely proud of what the children have achieved, especially as when she arrived at Hawkswood she expected to find kids fighting, swearing and an out-of-control atmosphere.But while some youngsters do fit the stigma of a PRU child - being from a broken home or a disadvantaged area - others dont.Many have working parents and, while figures show excluded and off-rolled kids are more likely to have special educational needs , a lot of Hawkswood students dont.But most of them do need to learn that actions have consequences.So wrong choices incur verbal, yellow and red warnings, or time penalties which have to be paid back during the after-school club at the end of the day.Like most PRUs, Hawkswood is getting more and more children through its doors. Last year, , primary school children aged between five and  were in PRUs - up from  in .But at the same time, funds are being slashed.It’s so hard because you’re cutting from the most vulnerable, says Marie.I strongly feel that later on it’s costing us more anyway.”Experts say every year group of permanently excluded pupils ends up costing the state £.billion in education, health, benefits and criminal justice costs.Marie suggests better training for teachers in mainstream schools could cut the amount of exclusions by helping them deal with challenging kids, but it’s not the full answer.There are always going to be those iniduals with a slightly higher level of need who will need an alternative provision, like a PRU, she says. Marie believes no child should be condemned as unteachable – and Kairon showed why, when he reflected on what he wants out of le in his second story.When my exclusion is over I am going to prove all the teachers I can do it and going to leave Hawkswood a successful young man,” he wrote.With many childrens futures left in tatters the moment theyre excluded from school, I hope for Kairons sake he defies the odds and does just that.According to statutory guidance released by the Department for Education, such action should only be taken:Reasons for exclusion might include bullying, arson, vandalism, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, persistant disruptive behaviour, physical assault or racist abuse,.Youngsters who repeatedly fail to either follow academic instruction or complete a behavioural sanction, like a detention, may also find themselves kicked out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is the Cabinet.It is not only Theresa May who let down Conservative Party voters, members and supporters.She was abetted and supported by her Cabinet. In this country we operate a system of collective responsibility and it is not good enough for Cabinet members now to claim they held a dferent view or would have done things dferently.How can it be right that Cabinet Ministers, who were complicit with the failed Brexit polices of Chequers, the Withdrawal Agreement and the subsequent betrayal of Brexit, credibly seek to claim they are an acceptable choice for this role They were sat around the top table when decisions were made and must take responsibility for them.I would sup with a very long spoon indeed with those who are complicit but now claiming they can offer the Party new leadership and direction.The British public are not stupid and our Party members know what they are voting for.They wont be fooled by those born-again ‘Leavers’, who trumpet their devotion to Brexit even though they have done nothing for the last three years to advance theof British sovereignty.The British public and our long suffering Party members know where the responsibility for the greatest breach of trust in our democratic institutions lies.After three years of being repeatedly told that ‘nothing has changed’, the time has come for ‘everything to change’.The British people are desperate for our country to leave the EU on st October. They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again. Our destiny is as a global beacon of free trade, not a satellite of the EU.The Conservative Party must quit the navel-gazing and stop the rot of this Brexit betrayal.Those of us who believe in our Country and people, who respect our democratic and political freedoms, will continue to stand up for our liberty to make sure the days of betrayal are over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership. We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.It’s not too late to take advantage of the opportunities we hoped for in voting Leave. It’s time to look forward we have an incredibly bright future ahead of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Kowal family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children. Thanks to The Sun and The Sun readers for getting behind this important campaign.”Dr Hilary Cass OBE, Chair of BACDEvery professional working in the field of childhood disability will be grateful to The Sun for launching the Give it Back campaign.Naseem Waker, mum of Leila, sevenThe Give It Back campaign shows the stark reality of a very complex situation. I am delighted a paper with the clout of The Sun has taken up the cause. Dan White, writer and broadcaster, dad of Emily, It’s  and parents and children in our community are like ghosts to society. We live amongst you, breathe your air, look at the same stars, but you do not know us.

pro eu party flops in polls and tears itself apart","story":"Just  days after their launch. six of the breakaway partys MPs - including the interim leader Heidi Allen - chose to quit the group today after weeks of troubles, gaffes and in-fighting.Sources claimed Ms Allen – a former Tory – recommended last week that the party should dissolve after their disastrous European Election results.But in heated make-or-break talks yesterday, ex-Tory Anna Soubry and former Labour MP Chris Leslie insisted they would keep going.In a statement, Ms Allen said that by “ing to sit as independents we will be best placed to work cross party”.The anti-Brexit movement said they will now sit in Parliament as independent MPs, but theres speculation they could now join with the Liberal Democrats.One source said they were convinced that Ms Allen and fellow ex-Tory Sarah Wollaston had already received offers to join themTories Ms Allen and Sarah Wollaston also walked out after rows behind the scenes, but Anna Soubry stayed behind and took the reigns up as leader of the remaining  MPs.Luciana Berger – another to quit – is understood to have held talks about a ‘non-aggression pact’ with Lib Dems in her Liverpool Wavertree constituency.They said in a joint statement today the priority for the beleaguered party must be to provide collegiate leadership to bring people together in the national interest.Furious new leader Ms Soubry said earlier: Im deeply disappointed that at such a crucial time in British politics our former colleagues have made this decision.Now is not the time to walk away, but instead to roll up our sleeves and stand up for the sensible mainstream centre ground.And in a thinly veiled dig at Ms Allen, Mike Gapes – an ex-Labour MP who is also staying on – said: “Those of us with political experience knew we’d be in this for the long haul.”Chuka Umunna – a former Labour Shadow Business Secretary - immediately launched a new website under ‘The Alternative’.He said: “The Remain forces need to work even more closely together.“We need to regroup and consolidate activity to maximise our impact.”In March a group of Labour MPs left over Jeremy Corbyn and the partys failure to tackle anti-Semitism, and three Tories quit to fight for a second referendum.But the party have made a series of huge errors and ended up polling just . per cent in the European elections and not getting a single MEP elected.And at the time Ms Soubry attacked Ms Allen for the bizarre idea that people should vote tactically for the Lib Dems in some parts of the UK.Remainers the Lib Dems did much better and swept up many more people who wanted a second referendum.After todays split they were urging the leftover Change UK MPs to come over and join them.Lib Dem leadership hopeful said earlier: Change UK’s swt demise shows that my reluctance from the beginning to discuss mergers and pacts, and to hold firm in our belief that the Liberal Democrats are the clear home for all who want to stop Brexit, was the right call.Anyone who signs up to our core liberal values of liberty, equality and community would be welcome to the newly invigorated Liberal Democrats.The collapse completes a farcical three months for a party that vowed to “crush” the Lib Dems and become the clear centrist threat to the Tories and Labour when they launched.There was confusion over branding as the party went from being called the “Tiggers” – the Independent Group – to Change UK.As the polls turned against the new party, MEP candidate Rachel Johnson joked she appeared to have joined a “sinking ship”.Insiders said the split showed that some – such as Mr Leslie and Ms Soubry – had long-held dferences with the Lib Dems on issues such as security and law and order."},{"url":null,"title":"family kids orphaned house blaze","story":"Him Gurung was left fighting for his le after leaping from the window of the family home  cradling his daughter as his we lay

of dancers and gymnasts taking part in the highly coordinated show in the May Day Stadium in capital Pyongyang – it has since been revealed that Kim was unhappy with the event.It is not clear whether the strongman leader will carry out executions as a result of his disapproval of the opening ceremony.The states news agency KCNA said the dictator “called creators of the performance and seriously criticised them for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude, pointing to the contents and forms of works”.He said that performers “have a very important duty in socialist cultural construction” it was reported.The colourful event is a huge propaganda exercise detailing the history of the rogue state and depicting modern le in the crackpot country.Kim watched the performance along with his we Ri Sol-ju, his sister and other high-ranking Korean officials in the , seat stadium.Images from the event shown on South Korean television showed one of the dictators senior advisers with his head in his hands during the ceremony.North Korea expert Minyoung Lee told the BBC that the despot’s criticism is not unusual.She said: “Kim Jong-un publicly criticises departments and poor work performance.”Ms Lee added that Kim’s criticisms can range from events such as the games to trees supposedly being planted incorrectly.However, the North Korean leader has been on a blood-soaked purge following the failure of his summit in Hanoi with Donald Trump.Agricultural official Hwang Min was executed with an anti-aircraft gun after he challenged Kim’s leadership in .O Sang-hon, the deputy minister for public security was accused of corruption in  and was tied to a stake then burned alive with a flamethrower.Kim’s aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was poisoned after she protested the death of her husband in the same year.The rotund despot also had his older brother, Kim Jong-nam, bumped off while he was in Malaysia using a deadly nerve agent.A manager of a turtle farm in the country was shot when the corpulent dictator visited the farm after he explained that the reptiles had died due to a lack of power, water and food.According to reports, Kim executed five aides after his meeting with the US President ended without a deal.The tyrant is said to have ordered a firing squad to kill Kim Hyok-Chol and four of his underlings amid claims they sold information to the Americans.Kims bloody revenge on his Vietnam summit negotiating team was revealed by South Koreas Chosun Ilbo newspaper.A North Korean source said: Kim Hyok-Chol was investigated and executed at Mirim Airport with four foreign ministry officials in March.The newspaper claims Kims purge is designed to ert attention from discontent within the pariah state.But it didnt end there, with other officials packed off to North Koreas infamous death camps.Co-negotiator Kim Sung-Hye and translator Shin Hye-Young were among those sent to prison. Hye-Young is said to have done nothing wrong apart from making a translation error.In February, it was claimed Kim made his own uncle Jang Song-thaek watch his workmates get ripped apart by anti-aircraft guns during a string of sickening executions.Defector Kang Cheol-Hwan said he was told by those who witnessed the bloodshed that two men who worked with Kims relative were obliterated by the over-the-top firing squad.The luckless pair were allegedly targeted by eight massive anti-aircraft guns after having lumps of iron placed into their mouths by Kims cronies.Kims uncle was killed later that same year reportedly by the same method after branding him a traitor."},{"url":null,"title":"wild west cowboys unseen pics sale","story":"The historical images were taken by a British farm worker and show le on the ranches of Colorado and

The US President was asked by a reporterthe NHS should be on the table in any future trade deal - a position supported by his Ambassador but opposed by the British government. But Donald Trump appears to not understand or mishear and begins answering.Then, a clearly flustered Theresa May steps away from her podium and explains the issue to the President.   President Trump said: I think we’re going to have a great trade deal, yes.

So everything will be on the table. Absolutely.”     Just minutes later Health Secretary and Tory leadership contender Matt Hancock hit out at Mr Trump. He tweeted: Dear Mr President.

Dr Fox said that while he would protect the NHS in a trade deal, the exact details of what regulations would be in the future was something for inidual governments to decide. Speaking to LBC, the Tory Minister said: One of the main exemptions that exist in trade agreements is for governments to regulate their own public services and what it tends to say, notwithstanding anything in this agreement. Governments have absolute right to regulate their own public services and in our case,the NHS, and that wouldn’t change. You would imagine that would be a standard provision in any treaty as it was for example in the treaty that we just negotiated with Canada.  He also restated his support for protecting the NHS as current government policy. Earlier he tweeted: I have consistently been clear that we will protect the @NHSuk as part of any future trade agreement.But pushed onthat meant that the NHS would be a no go zone for private companies, Dr Fox said it would be something for each inidual future government to decide. Dr Fox said: Well the government would determine, the government of the day of whatever party would determine exactly what the regulations were round the NHS. What you would not have would be any interference with the NHS unless the government of the day wanted it to be so and that’s how it should be. It should be that governments have the right to regulate their own public services in the national interest.  But later Dr Fox issued a statement doubling down on his commitment to protect the NHS for as long as he is in office.He said: “The government has consistently been clear: the NHS is not for sale to the private sector, and never will be.As a doctor who trained and worked in the NHS, I am committed to ensuring that no trade agreements will ever be able to alter these fundamental facts.” Speaking to protesters outside Parliament yesterday Jeremy Corbyn says he will aposfight with every last breathapos to save the NHS from the clutches of US healthcare firms. But Dr Fox  criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for not attending the state dinner with Donald Trump. He said: He should have been there, this was not just a political visit, this was a state visit, where the President was here as a guest of the United Kingdom, he was there as a guest of her Majesty the Queen last night. It was a celebration of the sacrices that were made, and of course we are seeing the D-Day celebrations over the next few days, it was a celebration of the sacrices we have made together to protect our freedom and our democracy, and it’s a shame that you had a leader of the Labour Party who seemed to go out of this way to want to insult the President of the United States. A Labour Leader who doesn’t believe in maintaining nuclear weapons for the State, you do wonder what it is he is actually committed to.    The International Trade secretary described Ivanka Trump, who he sat next to at the dinner as an extremely intelligent, charming, pleasant and well-informed dinner partner. But in controversial remarks, Dr Fox said he sided with Mr Trump in a long-running dispute with London Mayor Sadiq Khan . In the past, Mr Trump has challenged Mr Khan to an IQ test and been critical of his response to the London Bridge attack in . Before landing Mr Trump tweeted: Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly aposnastyapos to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone-cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me. Kahn [sic] reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now. A spokesman for Mr Khan said the childish insults should be beneath the president of the United States. But Mr Fox said he sided with President Trump in the dispute. He said: I think it was very ill-advised of the Mayor of London to say that the red carpet should not be rolled out for the Leader of the free world, for the President of our closest ally, the United States, a country which is a guarantor of our security, a country which is our single biggest trading partner and which is our biggest investment relationship in the world.

It is like the greatest, the only useful thing I ever did in my le was having two children and one of them is right there.The interview between Letts and DC Neath ran for an hour and a half after he had been arrested on suspicion of breaching terrorism legislation. Wearing a green fleece and glasses, he explained his sense of joy when he was told by police, he was free to send funds to his son. According to Letts he was told by Prevent Officer PC Rachel Mahon that aposno court in the land would convict a parent for trying to protect his child and get a child out of a dangerous situationapos. Thataposs what she said to me. I was flabbergasterdlyhappy I had this massive sense of relief. Itaposs like yes we can do it but with the support of the police, this is fantastic, I was so happy. I was dancing about the place and I said well can I get that in writing and she said well it is official, I passed it up the chain.  But police told Lane and Letts the information they had been given on December  was wrong and they could not send money to their son. Describing his feelings on learning this, Letts said it was aposmassively deflating and crushing.apos So, I am supposed to email him, Facebook him back and say oh sorry Jack, yeah sorry you got all worked up and excited that yes you are going to get out and we are going to help you get out. In fact, the police have changed their minds, well that is not exactly going to make him trust the authorities for one thing and give himself up to the British. Letts said his son was in grave danger and he would be haunted by guilthe did not help him. He explained: So I went to bed that night and I thought we were going to talk about it the next day, although I was clearly minded to get it to him because Iaposll never forgive myselfI donapost save Jackaposs le when I have the chance to do it. And so, I went to bed and I thought we were going to talk about it in the morning and when I got up Sally said: aposIaposve sent itapos.  And you know, I didnapost know she was sending it but on the other hand I needed to help Jack out, so I supported the concept. The prosecution allege Lane and Letts jointly attempted to send £, to their son between September  and January . John Letts and Sally Lane, of Chiswell Road, Oxford, deny three charges of entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism. The trial continues.

How fantastic!” yells the old soldier, , the wind carrying away his excited cries. Perched in the stern, two young marines watch admiringly as the pensioner from Dudley, West Midlands, takes the adrenaline-pumping ride in his stride. But Albert doesn’t scare easily. And nor do the  other  to -year-olds watching from the quayside and ship decks.    Seventy five years ago they dodged bullets, bombs and U-boat torpedoes as they stormed the coast of Normandy to turn the tide of the Second World War. And today, as they sailed into the peaceful waters of Poole Harbour, this spirited band of brothers got a heroes’ welcome from today’s naval personnel. The Royal British Legion-chartered MV Boudicca, which had sailed overnight from Dunkirk, was escorted into dock by three marine vessels as local children waved from the quayside. After disembarking the veterans and their carers chatted to young service-men and inspected their modern kit. Then Albert, who saw his Bren gunner pal Ernest being shot and killed in front of him in the weeks after D-Day, joined a handful of others taking thrilling boat rides.    On the quay former Royal Marine Commando Eric Carter, , of Birmingham, climbed up into an armoured vehicle. Serving Marine Christopher Takacs of Charlie Company,  Commando, demonstrated a new grenade machine gun that fires  rounds a minute. He said: “They’re our forefathers and we look up to them. They laid the ­foundations of what we are today ­especially in the D-Day landings.”” Impressed Mr Carter, who landed on Juno beach with Canadian troops on D-Day, said: “They weren’t like this in my day. It’s a nice piece of kit.” Coxswains of  Assault Group’s  Assault Squadron and troops also showed off their kit before sharing stories with the D-Day heroes. Veteran Trevor Stacey, Royal Marine of  Commando, chatted happily. Albert Barnes, , of Southend, Essex, inspected a modern weapon’s sights.  Royal Marines veteran Robert William Yaxley, , said: “I feel so lucky to be here. I landed on D-Day and went through to Germany without a scratch.It’s very important to mark this.” Aboard the Boudicca, Gordon Highlander veteran James Glennie, , of Aberdeen, tried a modern assault gun. The veterans are on a week long cruise marking the anniversary and will be in Portsmouth today for the official commemoration attended by the Queen and President Trump.    On Thursday they drop anchor off Gold Beach, Normandy, for services at Bayeux’s Cathedral and War Cem­etery and a march-past in Arromanches. Arthur Jones, , of ­Wolverhampton, drove a Sherman tank on to Gold Beach as he served with the th Essex Yeomanry. He said: “Another of our tanks had been blown up. The men hadn’t made it so I didn’t know what lay in store. I made it through though.” Eyes welling up, he added: “I think I’m going to get emotional standing in the cemetery at Bayeux on Thursday with the chaps who didn’t come home.” Arthur Bailey, , served with the th West Riding Infantry Division on D-Day then with the Paras at the Battle of Arnhem in September . He spoke to two local schoolchildren fascinated by his chest-full of medals. Explaining what they were for, he told the girls: “A lot of men died in the war, there aren’t many of us left.”    He went on: “It’s lovely that they are showing an interest. Youngsters today don’t seem to know much about it. Perhaps this will spark new interest.” Jack Mortimer, , from Leeds also made friends with a group of pupils. Jack, a dispatch driver with the th Ordnance Beach Detachment, had transported ammunition and mortars in his jeep on D-Day. But yesterday he stood surrounded by youngsters jigging away as they showed him the moves for toothless Grandpa Shark in the Baby Shark dance. He beamed: “Oh, how marvellous. I’ll have to remember this one.”    He added: “Today has been brilliant. I can’t really get the words out. It’s just tremendous to be welcomed like this.” Back on the Boudicca the veterans enjoyed a talk from TV historian Peter Snow and were entertained by magician Lance Corporal Richard Jones, winner of Britain’s Got Talent in . L Cpl Jones, , who serves with the Household Cavalry, said: “This is a really wonderful event to be a part of. “It is incredible and awe-inspiring to hear what these men went through on D-Day and throughout the war. “They are clearly having a great time, making new friendships and renewing old ones and having a real laugh together.

Mobile phone records examined by the coroner found that despite the repeated calls to his GP on the morning of his death, he had not been able to speak to anyone.    Canterbury Coroneraposs Court heard last week how a note found in his pocket read aposVoices in my head. Iaposm sorry. Love you all xapos. The court heard how Mr Connell had been travelling with his we in Asia last  year and had suffered from altitude sickness as the base camp of Mount Everest.

He said that messages on Mr Connellaposs phone did not indicate that he was having apossuicidal thoughtsapos, but said: He was going through a dficult part of his le and had a history of mental health problems. His mental health deteriorated over a short period of time. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner James Dillon said: The evidence is clear that Paul would’ve deliberately made his way through and climbed over a wall or fence and I can take the view he did take his own le. A note was found in his pocket which shows his intent and I can record a death of suicide.Mum Donna Ayres, speaking to the Kent Messenger newspaper after the inquest last week, said that mental health wasnapost taken aposseriously enoughapos. She said: There was nothing physically wrong with him - they did all the tests.

Sintija Kazaka was just -years-old when she was killed on the A near Derby on May  last year, Derbyshire Live reports. She had got out of the car she was travelling in and strayed into the road after getting into an argument with its driver, an inquest at Derby Coroneraposs Court heard last year. It was then she was fatally struck by another vehicle.Her heartbroken sister Sarmite Circene, , has paid her respects to the factory worker a year after the tragedy, saying: Sintija was a joyful girl who enjoyed every day. “She loved to spend time with her daughter when she had the chance and she had lots of friends. Sarmite described her sister as helpful, friendly and joyful.  She said: “She always helped you out no matter where you were or what time it was. “Sintija was a very friendly person and for her it was easy to get to know people. She was very outgoing.” Sintijaaposs daughter is currently living in Latvia as she is more comfortable there, but the pair would travel between the two countries regularly. Her daughter is struggling to come to terms with the tragic loss of her mother. Sarmite said: “She’s finding it hard to make sense of it. She has had to go to a few counsellors to make her understand that her mummy isn’t there anymore. “She still thinks that the door is going to open and her mum is going to be there.”    Sintija was cremated in England , but her ashes were transported back to Latvia to be buried where her daughter can visit her growing up. Sarmite said: “She doesn’t know what’s happening now but when she grows up she will know that there is a place she can put flowers down at and see her mummy.” The mother was killed instantly when a red Ford Focus hit her on the inside lane of the A. Sintija, who lived in Boston Lincolnshire, had been walking back towards Derby and was hit. When asked about the driver of the car that hit Sintija, Sarmite said: “It is not that man’s fault.He was in the car picking up his children from the airport from a holiday. “It could have been anyone in his place. It was just an accident. “What he is going through right now is hard enough already.”  She also said this to the driver during the inquest into Sitija’s death, and he wiped away tears from his eyes as he walked from the witness desk to his seat. Sarmite said: “We are always going to remember Sintija as a smiley and joyful sister who was always helpful. “This year was so hard for us, but I can’t even imagine what her daughter is going through in Latvia.” In the inquest opening last year, senior coroner Dr Robert Hunter said: The first driver [of the vehicle she was travelling in] and the remaining passengers were arrested.They all denied being the driver and all were found to be drunk.” They were not prosecuted because police could not prove they were driving whilst drunk. Sarmite said: “We are shocked how that can be when four people were in the car drinking and no one has received justice. “But all that we can say is that they have to live with that for the rest of their lives. “They have to cope with that and I hope it is going to be hard.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero girl 7 saves family","story":"NewsHero girl, , saves family from death after remembering lesson from schoolQuick-thinking Jaydee-Lee Dummett woke up in the night to find her four-year-old brother confused and disorientatedShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  JUN NewsJaydee-Lee Dummett quickly realised why her little brother was confused \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn heroic little girl saved her family from deadly poisoning by remembering a lesson from school in the middle of the night.

His Mini was left completely mangled from the collision, with one of its front tyres knocked off and parts scattered across the road. Bosden hit the coupleaposs grey Ford Ranger so powerfully, it sent their vehicle backwards and off the A in the village of Cross-in-Hand, East Sussex.

Half of the Ford Rangeraposs bonnet was ripped off cleanly along with a wheel, and its windscreen was left shattered. The tragedy happened on September , , and Bosden also suffered serious injuries. Bosden, of nearby Heathfield, previously pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by careless driving.

He was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex. A statement released by the Evansaposs family said: The irresponsible and thoughtless actions of one young man have caused the death of two people.    This has led to the immeasurable, intense and wide-ranging grief and feelings of devastation in the lives of so many family members and friends. These lives can never be the same. Police Constable Shirley Ross, of Sussex Police, said: This collision was another tragic case where lives were needlessly lost and others devastated. Bosdenaposs decision that day to get behind the wheel of a high powered car and to drive in the reckless manner that he did, having consumed alcohol, was nothing short of dangerous. This case is another stark warning to all drivers, particularly those in this young age bracket, of the devastating consequences of exceeding speed limits and driving whilst under the influence of alcohol.

The ex Tory , who is a veteran campaigner against LGBT rights, was grilled about an article from  where she defended gay conversion therapy, and said the homosexual lobby was stopping people who want to turn straight from doing so.Speaking to Sky News she claimed that science may yet provide an answer to the question of whether people can switch sexuality. Her comments sparked a huge backlash, with fellow politicians branding her a relic from a bygone era and calling for her to be suspended from the Brexit Party.    Jeremy Gavins knows the harrowing reality of what the aposcureapos involves. Forty years ago he was forced to have electrical currents passed through his body at an NHS hospital. Now , Jeremy vividly remembers having both his arms strapped to a hard wooden chair while a strong electrical current was passed into his forearms as he writhed in agony.  The dry stone waller from Ulverston in Cumbria, told the : Iaposd been told my homosexuality was a disease and that the therapist could cure it. Jeremy was  when he realised he was attracted to men and when he was , and a pupil at St Bedeaposs Catholic Grammar School, in Bradford, he fell in love.    He said: I met Stephen when I was , doing O Levels. Iaposd never seen anyone so beautul in all my le. He had curly black hair and a lovely face. The teenagers became close friends and one day Jeremy confessed his love for him. For the next two years, the pair enjoyed a platonic relationship. Jeremy said: We couldnapost see each other outside school because Stephen lived  miles away by bus. But we saw each other every day at school and tried to sneak off to a corner of the common room so we could be alone. With Stephen, I could finally be myself. But it was when the two teenagers were preparing for le at dferent universities that an upset Jeremy told a teacher, who was a priest, about his feelings.  He was told his behaviour was sinful and the following day he was sent to the headmaster and given an ultimatum - be expelled from school just four weeks before his A Levels, or go to his GP and ask for treatment for his homosexuality. Jeremy said: At the time, I was terried thatI was expelled everyone would discover I was gay and disown me – my parents, the other boys on my rugby team – so I agreed to see my GP.  He was referred for therapy at Lynfield Mount Psychiatric Hospital, an NHS institution in Bradford, close to the school. A few weeks later a teacher escorted Jeremy to his first appointment but nobody explained what was about to happen. Jeremy was to be treated by Dr Hugo Milne, who would later appear at Peter Sutclfeaposs trial saying he believed the Yorkshire Ripperaposs story about hearing voices from God. Jeremy said: I supposed that because he was a doctor, he must know what he was doing. He showed me pictures of people kissing and having sex. If it was a man and a woman kissing, nothing happened, butit was two men, he gave me an electric shock. It was horrendous. I have no idea how long the session was but it seemed to go on for ever. At the end of each session, Jeremy got dressed and walked back to school. He said: I left the hospital in a daze. I couldnapost work out what had just happened. I was so stunned, I donapost think I was on this planet. But he became resigned to the therapy and endured two sessions every week.  Jeremy was brought up a strict Catholic in Keighley, Yorkshire, by his parents Bert and Betty. He had three brothers, Donald, Neil and Alistair and any mention of sex was forbidden. That summer, Jeremy failed his A levels and lost his place to study Chemistry at Leeds University. But he continued therapy and re-sat his exams. At Christmas, after six months of treatment, Dr Milne declared that Jeremy would never be cured of his homosexuality. Jeremy said:  They kicked me out of the door, just like that, and I never heard from them again. After failing his A Levels for a second time he left education. When he was  he decided to come out to his parents. Jeremy said: My dad just wouldnapost talk about it, Jeremy says. He said aposYouaposve ruined the word gay. We wonapost talk about this againapos. He stormed out of the room and we never said another word about it.  My mum was more understanding, but she was convinced it was just a phase I was going through. While the views held by Jeremyaposs father were typical of the time, a study in  found that nearly a fth of psychologists had participated in therapy at some point in their career. This could be counselling or more extreme treatments, although the number of people treated is not known. Five years ago the Royal College of Psychiatrists said there was no evidence to support the use of gay conversion therapy. There are no words that can repair the damage done to anyone who has ever been deemed aposmentally unwellapos simply for loving a person of the same sex, says Prof Wendy Burn, of the Royal College. For those who were apostreatedapos, the trauma of such experiences can never be erased. But for Jeremy, the damage had already been done. For many years after the therapy, he suffered bouts of depression, even feeling suicidal at times.  He said: Iaposve always berated myself for breaking down and telling someone I was gay because of the pain it caused. For decades afterwards, Jeremy suffered from black moods and had psychotherapy. In  he confided in his brother Neil about the aversion therapy. Jeremy said: He was outraged and wanted to confront our parents to seetheyaposd known anything about it. The following weekend, Jeremy and Neil confronted their parents, who swore they knew nothing about the barbaric treatment. Jeremy said: I believed them when they said they were oblivious. However, when he was sorting through his parentsapos possessions when they moved into sheltered accommodation, Jeremy discovered an old box of diaries detailing his hospital visits. There were pages in the diary where my mum had written the dates of my hospital visits. They had gone along with it. He said: I was shocked, but they were too old and infirm to talk about it with me by then.  Jeremyaposs parents have both since died and he says the relationship was dficult until their death. Jeremy had many dferent treatments for his depression and was ultimately diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder . But it was not until , when he had cognitive behavioural therapy, that he began to make progress. In , he started eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy , a treatment which helps PTSD sufferers connect memories in their brain which have been fragmented by trauma. Jeremy said: It made a world of dference to me. I used to have flashbacks to the aversion therapy, and unexplained jolting pains. But after  months of EMDR, the pains and flashbacks slowly disappeared. It was amazing. Jeremy has finally come to terms with what happened and feels he can now be honest about his sexuality. If thereaposs one thing I want people to take away from my story, itaposs that le can go on after terrible things happen, he says.

Keith Jenkins, , from Llandrindod Wells, Wales, went for several x-ray scans when he complained of a terribly sore neck.Doctors thought the pain was most likely caused by arthritis .But his symptoms worsened and one night in summer , he collapsed on the floor at home, screaming in pain.His daughter Michelle told Wales Online : He lay on the floor at pm, but he didnapost arrive in hospital until am the following morning.   The fire brigade was even called to assist the ambulance crew in getting him into the ambulance. The pensioner was taken across the border to Hereford County Hospital, his closest AE department. Following an MRI scan, it was discovered that he had cancerous tumour in his neck so big it had fractured his seventh vertebrae in the spine. He had been walking around literally using his hands to hold his head up. It was ridiculous, Michelle said in disbelief. Two days later, he was transferred to Birmingham Spinal Unit in hopes to remove the huge mass. Michelle was told that the tumour was wrapped around her fatheraposs spinal cord and they couldnapost take it all out.    Keith was given a course of radiotherapy and he was hospitalised for  days. In April -  months from the initial ordeal - Keith began having dficulties moving his neck and was checked in Birmingham again. Doctors found another tumour growing in his neck, in a similar place to the previous one. Michelle, devastated, said: He now needs another scan - known as a PET scan - in Cheltenham to seethe cancer has spread anywhere . But she claims that as Powys Teaching Health Board have not paid the bill for his previous scans NHS England has refused to carry them out.    Itaposs now been seven weeks since we discovered this new tumour, and we have no idea what itaposs doing to his body. We donapost want him to have a broken neck again,she added. Heaposs in a complete state of limbo. Itaposs an absolute disgrace. My dad is really close to my daughter Maisie-Bee, but because of the pain heaposs in heaposs unable to pick her up. He just has to have her sitting on his lap. A spokesman for Powys Teaching Health Board said: We are sorry to hear of these concerns. We have spoken with Welsh Health Specialised Services Commissioning- which is the national body in Wales responsible for planning and commissioning of specialised services including PET scan - and they have confirmed that they are not aware of any delays in payments for PET scans for Powys residents from hospitals in England. Requests for PET scans for Powys residents from hospitals in England are made through the WHSSC Prior Approvals process and their aim is to ensure that these requests are considered promptly.

I joined millions around the UK and beyond by fasting from dawn until sunset every night for a month, and documenting my experience below. Fasting, or apossawmapos as itaposs known in Arabic, is one of the five pillars of Islam. By giving up food, we think about those who are less fortunate than ourselves, and may not know when their next meal will come. But itaposs not just about food, itaposs about being grateful and appreciating all the things you have. For me, it has always been a way to realign myself with my faith every year. Some days I find myself feeling more focused, mindful and at peace. I feel the benefits, I see the purpose of it and I even enjoy it, telling myself I might just fast on random days during the year to ground myself.  But other days I feel I canapost cope, my stomach grumbles, I consider giving up, I feel void of energy and Iaposve had enough. During the month, I have been blogging my experience to lt the lid on what fasting is really like - see below for my latest post on Eid al-Fitr. Being as honest as I can be, I have writen about my highs, my lows and everything in between. I have also answered all those questions youaposve probably never dared ask. To start with a few: No youaposre not allowed to drink water, yes you can brush your teeth, no I donapost believe it is harmful to your healthitaposs done sensibly , no you canapost just eat something and aposnot tell anyoneapos and yes you can swallow your own saliva... June : Happy Eid al-Fitr! Reflections on the month as Ramadan comes to a close Aside from having way too much sugar and caffeine, it feels great to be back to a normal routine today.Iaposm excited to be able to exercise again and to sleep normal hours without worrying about when I can or canapost eat.The month has been good for re-gaining perspective on many things in le though. As always, Iaposm glad I persevered and to be honest, it wasnapost as hard as I felt it would be on day .Now itaposs time for Muslims all over the world to get together with family and friends and celebrate Eid al-Fitr.May : Exhausted on Day  and ready for the challenge to end Itaposs Day  and the end is near - which Iaposm definitely ready for. I feel exhausted by the late nights, early starts, interrupted sleeps and disturbed social le . But this is the last week of the month and I know I can do it, evennow mentally Iaposve begun the countdown.  May : Answers to all the questions Iaposve been asked by Day  Since I began fasting, Iaposve been asked many questions about the experience, which I see as a positive thing as it opens up an interesting dialogue. Here are the answers to all the questions that have come my way so far: - Do you feel any health benefits  Actually, yes. It makes you think more about what youaposre putting in your body. But also, I find fasting aposshrinks your stomachapos which isnapost always a bad thing. - How and when do you exercise  Although I know of people who continue to hit the gym, the only exercise I do during Ramadan is walking because I donapost want to use all my energy up.  - Whatyouaposre ill  If youaposre ill, you are not expected to fast. Children, the elderly, pregnant and breastfeeding women, women who are on their period, and people who are travelling a substantial distance also have permission to not fast. - Whatyou need to take medicine  If you need to take medicine you are also not expected to fast. - Whatitaposs your birthday  Unfortunately, you donapost get a free pass for your birthday. - If youaposre drinking lots of water at night, do you not get up to go to the toilet a lot  Annoyingly - yes. - Where do you eat  Wherever I am. The ideal is to be in the comfort of my own home obviously. But le doesnapost stop so evenit means sometimes eating at my desk on a night sht, thataposs just how it is. May : Feeling strong, clear-minded and focused by Day  - but fearing it won’t last long It’s day nine, and I feel in the swing of Ramadan. I’m in a phase where I feel like I can do it, I feel strong. I also feel clear-minded and every year I find it amazing how it can actually give you focus at work or with whatever you’re doing. You’d think it would make you feel void of energy - and it can - but other times there’s a source of energy that seems to come from somewhere. I also spent the weekend just gone with family which was motivating, as we are all on a shared journey. It was nice to break fast with others who appreciated it in the same way and had been through the same thing to get to that point.  Also, it was a healthy change from the solo venture I’m normally on, which can be tough at times. I may be coping well right now, but Iaposve done Ramadan for enough years now to not get too smug about it, as from one day to the next I know how much things can dfer.  May : Challenges Iaposm facing with fasting as I reach Day Four I’m on day four of fasting and so far, I’m fine without food, and I’m fine without water. But what I am really struggling with is the lack of caffeine. Like many, I rely on a cup of tea or coffee to give me a boost in the morning to help me work, focus, and perk me up in general. I woke up on Monday, the first day of Ramadan, with a pounding headache and knewI could just have even a sip of coffee it would have been fixed. But alas, I powered through and the pounding head soon disappeared as the day went on. What I’ve also realised is how much we use food and drink for comfort. Filling our bellies is not just about sustenance. Our meals and hot drinks affect us emotionally and give our moods a boost. Without that bit of sugar, or whatever  it is you crave, we have to find inner strength to give us that push.  Something  I’ve done, which I’m not sure I should have, is calculate the number of hours I’m fasting. Using the official dawn and sunset times for London todayI will be fasting for a total of more than  hours. That leaves me with under seven hours to try and fit in three balanced meals and two pints of water while striving for the recommended eight hours sleep - an impossible task. So instead I have to weigh things up and decide what to compromise on - food, water or sleep  Generally I prioritise water as I know how important it is to be hydrated, I try and get in two meals as any more would make me feel sick in such a short space of time, and aim to sleep for six hours, but itaposs certainly a squeeze.    May : Ramadan is imminent and I feel totally unprepared Ramadan begins on Monday, and I feel totally unprepared. The truth is, thereaposs no way to get yourself ready mentally - it seems to just come around really quickly every year and you just have to get on with it. Iaposve written a checklist - or shopping list - of what I need to get beforehand. Dates come top of the list as Muslims break their fast with dates every night. Itaposs a tradition that goes back to the Prophet Mohammed, and the high levels of sugar are a great way to boost your energy having not eaten for hours. Iaposm going to hit Tesco and make sure my fridge is well stocked for the night times. Then Iaposll have a huge feast, drink lots of water and go to bed ready for the challenge to begin.  When is Ramadan  It is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle. When it starts is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month. If the new moonis spotted, fasting begins the following day. Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan,the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete and Eid is celebrated the following day. Local sightings of the moon can dfer, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days dferent countries start and end their fast. It moves about  days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year. Ramadan can last either  or  days. This year it began on Monday May .

A court heard the group fought each other and dropped their trousers during a flight branded eight hours of pure hell. Two of the group attempted to lt the skirt of a cabin crew member, and the flight was forced to ert to Canada so they could be booted off. Construction boss Michael Ward, , and three of his seven-strong group got drunk on rum and vodka during the am Thomas Cook flight. During the , mile journey from Manchester Airport, airline staff had to confiscate five litres of alcohol from the boorish Brits. The men became rowdy and sweary towards fellow passengers as the plane cruised at , feet.    One of the stag party began performing drunken press up in the aisle whilst shouting Boom and another told a stewardess: Iaposm going to ruin your time like youaposve ruined ours. The pilot of MT eventually had to make an unscheduled stop at the Canadian province of Winipegg - , miles away from Las Vegas so they could eject their unruly group. The aircraft had to dump ,kg of fuel as a result and the remainder of  passengers on board including  children had to wait almost three hours before the plane took off again to complete its journey. The airline were left with a bill of £, - including the cost of paying forflights back to the UK for five of the group.    In a statement one passenger Francis Dwyer said: They were were screaming and shouting and one of them called a stewardess a aposscouse b****apos when she refused to serve them alcohol. I could see males behind us fighting and punching each other whilst one was doing push ups in the aisle. It was eight hours of pure hell. At Manchester Crown Court, dad-of-two Ward, and guests Scott Capper, , a businessman and father-of-three, and Craig Hopwood, , a carpet fitter and father of two and all from Oldham, were each jailed for two years after they admitted being drunk on an aircraft and affray. Father-of-one Daniel Howarth,  also from Oldham, was jailed for  months after he admitted being drunk on an aircraft and a public order offence.  The incident occurred on March  this year after the group boarded the flight a weekend away. Prosecutor David Lees said: The defendants were all part of a stag party and were under the influence of alcohol from the start of the flight. They continues to drink their own alcohol during the flight despite being told not to do so and at the start of this flight the cabin manager had even made an announcement that it was illegal to be drunk on the Las Vegas flight due to previous issues with stag parties. A number of bottles of spirits were confiscated from them and the group were rowdy offensive and fighting amongst themselves. The court heard one stewardess had to speak to the group three times before take off, and a passenger who tried to joke with them about their behaviour was told: f*** off you t** before having his chair kicked.  The prosecutor added: Once the plane set off they got louder and louder and it became unbearable. When they were refused drinks then were shouting screaming and Mr Howarth went into the aisle and did press ups shouting aposboom.apos Hopwood and Howarth started fighting each other and one punched the other on the arm. On being told the flight would be erted one said: aposLetaposs cause more trouble.apos One woman on the flight with with her husband said the stag group had been loud in the queue when they got on board and she could see they had been drinking. They were filling up bottles and staff refused to serve them with one stewardesses confiscating drink. Their behaviour got worse and they were shouting appalling language across the plane. Ward was the worst behaved and pulled down the shorts of Hopwood who then pulled down his own pants. This was visible to everyone and he was smoking an e-cigarette which was confiscated. Ward and Hopwood even tried to lt the skirt of a stewardess and were throwing water at each other. A third passenger heard one of the defendants shouting: aposIaposve got £ of alcohol here.apos When warned the flight would be erted the defendant shouted: aposI donapost care.apos  Stewardess Chloe Chaloner said in a statement: I saw fighting between the group and the throwing of water. They were mithering for drinks before take off and and when they were refused they caused trouble blocking the trolly as we went past. I confiscated five litres of alcohol and on my break one of them got up and sat opposite me staring constantly and saying: aposIaposm going to ruin your time like youaposve ruined ours.apos I found them intimidating and aggressive. Whenever one fell asleep the others would punch him hard and they would start fighting each other. When told we were landing one said they had a bomb in the bag. The Brits were arrested when they arrived back in the UK. In interview Ward denied drinking on the aircraft and claimed not to recall bad language or fighting.  Hopwood denies exposing himself and claimed one stewardess had told Ward: Who would marry you  But Judge Hilary Manley told all four mem: You caused your fellow passengers a great deal of upheaval and stress with some of them missing connecting flights. It is ironically you were flown home with tickets paid for by Thomas Cook and it may want to look at recouping some of the losses they incurred through the civil courts as a result of this shameful incident. Passengers describe a deeply distressing incident and one described it as apos hours of pure hell.apos One described seeing your boorish behaviour in the restaurant of the departure lounge and was dismayed to realise you would be getting her flight. You were drunk before boarding the plane and none of you were in a fit state to be on an airplane. You did exactly as you wanted and you interrupted the safety demonstration with your boorish drunken behaviour - drinking rum, vodka and the like that you had bought from duty free. I have seen images of the bottles you drank from and there was little left. This was an am flight and you created a threatening and wholly unsafe situation. You were insulting to the crew and you used disgusting and obscene language - a group of large drunken men. An experienced crew member said it was the worst behaviour sheaposs seen in more than  years of working. A single unruly drunk can be contained but this is no such case here. You ignored all the warnings given to you and you caused fear to passengers and impacted the safety of the aircraft. You were still drinking and being abusive towards fellow passengers even as the plane was landing in Winnipeg. This is such a serious example of drunkenness on an aircraft. You are all family men with people relying on you but the experience of a drunken group in the confined space of an aircraft for a long haul flight is a truly terrying one. There needs to be a deterrent sentence to such behaviour.  "},{"url":null,"title":"theme park guests double take","story":"NewsTheme park guests double take as they think they spot the Queen on rollercoasterVisitors to Drayton Manor Park had a shock as Her Majestys lookalike enjoyed the rides, along with her great-grandchildrenShareCommentsByJack Peat:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video the-queen-enjoying-ride-rollercoaster-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShocked onlookers had a royal day out like no other yesterday, as they saw ‘The Queen’ enjoying a ride on a rollercoaster. ‘Her Majesty’ appeared to be enjoying attractions at Drayton Manor Park in Tamworth, and even had great-grandchildren Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis in tow.

She even braved an exhilarating ‘Royal-er coaster’ ride on the Troublesome Trucks Runaway Rollercoaster, clinging to her hat as she was THRONE around the track.    But while spectators looked on in shock, all was not quite as it seemed - the ‘Queen’ actually turned out to be professional doppelganger Mary Reynolds, recruited to highlight the park’s adult and toddler offering ahead of her rd birthday.

This is their tragic story...They paid the ultimate price as they tried to save the lives of badly injured soldiers - becoming the only two British servicewomen killed during the Normandy landings. Nurses Dorothy Field, , and Mollie Evershed, , perished while tending  wounded soldiers from a sinking hospital ship. But their memories will be honoured afresh when their names are engraved on the planned £million British Normandy Memorial. They will be the only two women among the , names of those who lost their lives under British command during the Normandy campaign.As Prime Minister Theresa May and French president Emmanuel Macron prepare to unveil a foundation stone and a sculpture at the site of the memorial off Gold Beach on Thursday, the full story of the heroines of Normandy can now be told.   Dorothy and Mollie were serving with Queen Alexandraaposs Imperial Nursing Auxiliary on the SS Amsterdam. The Amsterdam had carried US rangers for Omaha Beach on D-Day – where they had suffered heavy casualties scaling the clfs – before converting into a hospital carrier ship, with wards and operating theatres, aimed at keeping the wounded alive and transporting them back to the UK for hospitalisation. For weeks since then, the medical staff, including Mollie and Dorothy, had nursed horribly injured men caught in the fighting still raging on the French mainland. Both were ranked as sisters, but Dorothy was a matron Then on August , , while making its third journey back to the UK carrying casualties, the vessel struck a mine off Juno Beach in fog, shortly before am. Knowing the ship was stricken, both women went below to help the stretcher-bound wounded up to a waiting leboat. Amid the chaos and panic of the sinking ship, they helped save many lives. The last man Dorothy assisted had just had a leg amputated.    But by the time they tried to escape the foundering ship themselves, it was simply too late. The Amsterdam sank in just eight minutes and their bodies were never to be recovered. Witnesses reported seeing a nurse, thought to be Mollie, trying to squeeze out of a porthole as the ship sank. In total,  wounded men were lost, along with  medical staff,  crew and  prisoners of war –  souls in all. But there is no doubt the death toll would have been far higher without their heroism. Another nurse, Lily McNicholas, from Ireland, survived the tragedy and was awarded an MBE for her heroism. One of the Amsterdamaposs crew, Patrick Manning, later recalled: The ship seemed to be broken in the middle, with one half listing one way and the other half the other. One of the funnels and the mast were down and the screws were out of the water. Only one LCA could get away to pick up survivors.  The wounded men were safely evacuated back to Britain where they wrote praising letters in tribute to the heroism of the nurses. They also wrote to Dorothyaposs parents in Crow, Hampshire, who were already grieving the death of her brother Charles, a test pilot, killed in . There is no record of either of the nurses having been married – though Mollie was thought to have been engaged – and it is not knownany of their families survive them. Mollie, born in Battle, East Sussex, went to Ely High School in Cambridgeshire. In July , the school magazine published a stirring tribute to its fallen pupil. It stated: In August of last year, she was on a hospital ship full of wounded men. An explosion occurred and the ship began to sink but Mollie and the Matron succeeded in carrying up to the deck about  stretcher cases.  Finally, however, Mollie was trapped below deck and she went down with the ship. Practical, steady and reliable, Mollie was always eager to help in any way. She was energetic, lively, full of fun and friendly and popular with everyone in the school, both staff and girls. We, who knew her and remember her, were grieved to hear of the loss of a young le, so full of promise, but we are also very conscious and proud of the heroism, devotion and sacrice which she showed in that hour of her supreme testing. Mollie is also commemorated on the Soham Town memorial. Former Ely pupil Christine Fuller, , who came across Mollieaposs story in the schoolaposs archives, said: She was an incredibly brave young woman who worked miracles to save as many servicemen as possible in horrendous conditions.

Amy Sharp, , had been texting a man she knew as aposJamesapos on the dating app for three weeks before she agreed to meet him for a drink around pm last Wednesday. Amy claims when she arrived a total of four men got out of the white Mercedes and approached her through the dark pub car park. Amy rang aposJamesapos, only for one of the menaposs phones to light up as he walked towards her - prompting her to realise the account had used fake photos to lure her in.  After fleeing and calling the police, Amy claims cops told her aposJamesapos admitted heaposd used a fake name and pictures as he was scared his girlfriend would find out - but denied showing up with the group, leading to the case being dropped. The hair and make up artist believes she would need to have been attacked for the police to do anything and is calling for the law to be changed about catfishing. Catfishing is using a fake profile or identity to form a romantic relationship with someone online. It is not currently illegal in the UK. Amy, from Chard, Somerset, said: I was really shaken up.    With all the Ted Bundy stuff, I know itaposs really extreme, but you just donapost know how far itaposs going to go. The more I think about it the scarier it is. It was obviously calculated.    I donapost want to know what would have happenedI got out that car.    At the end of the day, there were four blokes there. Iaposm ft and nine stone.    Letaposs be honest, they werenapost all coming for a drink.     Four blokes going to meet one girl on her own - I donapost know what they were planning on doing. They werenapost all going to take me for dinner.    Iaposm not saying he was going to murder me, but at the end of the day, he gave me a fake name.    Something was going to happen but I donapost know what.    Amy, who claims sheaposs been single for ages, initially met James on Tinder and found him totally normal.    The pair even spoke over the phone every day for three weeks before agreeing to meet for a drink in Tiverton, Devon, which was  minutes from Amyaposs house. Amy pulled up in the pub car park and spotted the white Mercedes that aposJamesapos had told her to look out for - but with four men waiting in it.Amy said: It was all totally normal. He had an Instagram account, WhatsApp, all his photos were the same person. He did something to do with accounts in an office.We spoke on the phone most days for three weeks. If I ever meet somebody I always chat to them on the phone first because you can get a better feel for them. We got on well. He seemed really easy going and told me about his job, his family and his ex-girlfriend. On the night, he was in the car he said heaposd be in, a white Mercedes, and I parked opposite.    I saw him get out the car with three other people.    It all happened so fast. [At first I thought] he looked like him, but afterwards I found out he used fake photos because he had a partner.   All of the men started walking towards my car. I rang his number and his phone lit up and I drove off.    Fleeing the scene quickly and counting her blessings that she had gone in her car, Amy was so shaken up she called her friend and then the police. That night, she couldnapost stop thinking about what would have happenedshe had got out of the car. He texted her after asking why sheaposd fled, to which she responded asking how he couldaposve possibly thought it was okay to bring three other men with him on their first date. At first he said he brought a friend with him because he didnapost know I was genuine, then it came out it was a fake name, Amy said. He then said aposokay, fine, Iaposm Matthew. I used a fake name and fake pictures because Iaposve got a girlfriend and I didnapost want her to knowapos.  He then pleaded her not to contact police as he told her: Iaposm disgusted with my thoughts and behaviour tonight. To me he was going to do something really dodgy. I told him aposyouaposre sick.

Noa Pothoven, from the Netherlands, died last Sunday after a period of starving herself though the exact circumstances of her passing are not clear. In a heartbreaking final social media post one day before her death, Noa made her tragic decision public. The Dutch teenager, from Arnhem, said she felt le had become unbearable and she could no longer carry on. Noa had penned an autobiography called aposWinning or Learningapos about her battles with mental illness after reportedly being molested and raped at a young age. As a result of the abuse she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder , depression and anorexia.    Noa said she wanted her book to help vulnerable youngsters who struggle with le, arguing the Netherlands does not have specialised institutions or clinics where teens can go for psychological or physical aid.In her final Instagram post - which Dutch media reports her sister confirmed on Sunday - Noa wrote about her decision.“I deliberated for quite a while whether or not I should share this, but decided to do it anyway, she wrote.

This iconic photo of Tank Man, the mysterious protester whose identity has never been discovered, has come to symbolise the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing that shocked the world  years ago this week. But for Dr Shao Jiang, who was there and survived, that extraordinary hero was far from a lone figure. Shao, , witnessed scores more brave campaigners, many of them young students, face down the tanks sent in by the communist government to quash the crowds of thousands who had spent  days making peaceful calls for democracy.    Some even sat frozen on their bicycles in the slim hope the flimsy metal might help deter the mighty machines. But while the tanks did momentarily stop for Tank Man, for countless others they did not. Shao’s dreams are still haunted by his vivid recollections of bodies rolled utterly flat by the tanks. “All the people on the street were Tank Men that night,” he says. “The shooting was going on and people were still running to try and block the tanks, which were travelling at high speed, some positioning buses in the road. But the tanks crushed the buses and people, they didn’t care. People’s bodies were merged, moulded to their bicycles. They were flat.” The Chinese regime has never released an official death figure but estimates run as high as ,. So cloaked in secrecy is Tiananmen that even today, there has been no accountability and even public commemoration is banned. It is disturbing confirmation that any hint of dissent in the world’s second largest economy will not be tolerated.    This is a land where activists are reportedly “disappeared” and state surveillance is suffocating – stoking fears that allowing Chinese tech giant Huawei to build our G infrastructure would leave us vulnerable to spying, although the company denies this. His voice dropping, Shao adds: “I had nightmares afterwards and I still have them sometimes. I wake up and relive what happened. I see the people crushed by tanks, crushed into their bicycles, people who just became flat.” Shao, an academic, lives in London after escaping China via Hong Kong and Sweden because of his part in the protests. The former politics student drafted seven key demands for the rebels to present to the government, including freedom of speech. After the massacre, he was jailed for  months and tortured, then later re-arrested and jailed again.    It would be unsafe for him toto his homeland, where President Xi Jinping’s communist regime has an appalling record on human rights abuse. Anyone who calls for democracy there risks their freedom and their le. And anyone who was involved in the Tiananmen protests is even more closely monitored and fiercely targeted. The National Coalition of Human Rights Defenders believes there are currently  Tiananmen participants in jail for activism, another in pre-trial detention and two on suspended sentences. Five have recently been released from prison. “Punishments for former  participants are often harsher than for other prisoners,” said a spokesman. Shao’s parents remain in China and all of his calls to them are monitored. “My parents’ phone is tapped. Sometimes my call is cut,” he says. “I worry about them. No one is safe in China. Butyou worry too much, the government’s strategy is very effective.” During President Xi’s controversial state visit here in , Shao protested by holding banners in front of his motorcade. He was held but charges were dropped. He was already being watched and recalls: “I was followed, even two days before the visit.” Shao’s parents will have had to mark the anniversary of Tiananmen behind closed doors. The regime has worked very hard to eradicate the national memory of the atrocity.    “Most young people don’t know. The government think the young people will make trouble,” explains Shao. “The older generation don’t want to talk about it. They are frightened.” It was the death of former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang on April , , which sparked the pro-democracy protests. He had worked for reform and his loss prompted thousands to march. On May , more than  students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. A later rally drew . million, prompting martial law. By June , the military were on the streets, killing demonstrators. At am on June , they reached Tiananmen –which translates as “gate of heavenly peace”. The irony is acute. Two years ago, a formerly classied British diplomatic cable was released, alleging at least , died. It also gave horric detail, stating wounded female students were bayoneted and human remains were “hosed down drains”. Shao was not initially in the square but on West Chang’an Street, leading to it. When he saw the bloodshed, he went to warn protesters. “People were dying around me,” he says. “When they shot, I lay on the pavement to avoid the bullets. There was blood down the street, running like water. Streams of blood. People were piling the bodies on tricycles to take them to hospital. These were innocent people with no weapons.” He made it to the square in the early hours and remained there until am. The army struck a deal that people could leave peacefully before am – but they broke it. Shao recalls: “The soldiers came and beat the people, the tanks came around .am. There was around  tanks in the square.” In prison, Shao was tortured with bright lights in his eyes, leaving him partially sighted. “Others were tortured to death,” he says. He was released after  months but later re-arrested for challenging the government. “This time they put  people in one cell,  metres square. It was very bad, only a little water and  degrees. Some people lost consciousness. I was in there for  days. I lost kg.” When Shao sees the Chinese government’s ever-strengthening grip on the people, all of the suffering he and other protesters went through seems painfully in vain. He stresses that the international community must be vigilant. Shao also simply laughs when I ask himallegations that Huawei could use the opportunity of a contract here to covertly collect data for the communist regime could prove true.

His time at the club would be mixed, however.A stand-out in the reserve side, a -year-old Strachan made his debut first-team appearance as a substitute for the Dark Blues in the Drybrough Cup, a - extra-time victory at home to Raith Rovers, on July , . He would come off the bench again a few weeks later in a - League Cup victory at Partick Thistle – a competition they’d eventually go on to win by seeing off Celtic at Hampden through Gordon Wallace’s single strike.The young Strachan, however, would have to wait till the end of the following season to make a first league start for the club – a - home win over Hearts with goals from Ian Anderson and Jocky Scott that saw them finish in sixth in the old Division One.In  , under manager Davie White, after two Scottish Reserve Player of the Year awards, Strachan made himself a mainstay of the Dark Blues’ side in the top flight.It was a struggle of a season, however, and despite the emergence of the talented youngster Strachan, Dundee toiled.Their defence of the League Cup ended before the end of August as they bowed out in the old-style group stage with two defeats to Hibs as well as a draw and loss against Ayr United.A - opening-day victory over Aberdeen in the league promised better in that competition but then a winless run of five games followed, signalling a troubling campaign.Strachan would grab his first senior goal with a penalty in a - defeat at Dens Park to Motherwell and then add two more in draws against Hearts and Ayr before a double against St Johnstone.However, in his first full season as a senior pro, Strachan’s side were relegated from the very first Premier Division on goal dference despite finishing on the same points as neighbours Dundee United and Aberdeen.Despite  goals from Billy Pirie and  netted throughout the season, the Dark Blues couldn’t get back up at the first time of asking, finishing third behind St Mirren and Clydebank.The failure toimmediately left the club with dire financial consequences, forcing them to sell their star Strachan to Aberdeen to prevent the bank closing the doors at Dens.A fee of £, plus Jim Shirra saw a -year-old Strachan head for Pittodrie to play for Billy McNeill.He’d eventually go on to win two Premier Divisions, three Scottish Cups, the European Cup Winner’s Cup and the European Super Cup with the Dons.His career down south would see him win the FA Cup with Manchester United and the last First Division title with Leeds United in a stellar club career that also saw him capped  times by Scotland, scoring five goals and playing in two World

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

number from  in   to  in .ldquoThere is considerable overlap between day centres and social centres such as providing transport, meals and social opportunities.ldquoDay centres provide personal care, whereas in social centres personal care would be provided by other means, e.g. a personal assistant.ldquoThe current daily charge for a day service placement is pound, whereas a social centre charge is pound.ldquoAs the transformation proceeds social centres will be kept under review to ensure that they meet the accessibility and volume requirements for a buildings based option.ldquoEach locality will have a local area coordination team consisting of a local area coordinator and link workers.ldquoThe volume of staff will reflect the local population and needs. The team will hold a caseload of people who are in need of day time opportunities.ldquoLocal area coordinators engage with people and discuss what interests they have and what activities they would like to be involved in.ldquoActivities can range from pursuing an interest in fishing, attending a walking or gentle exercise group, through to attending a local soup and sandwich club.ldquoWith their knowledge of the locality, local area coordinators build up a range of opportunities for older adults to get involved with and contribute to their local community.ldquoIf they identy a gap in provision, they engage with partners to develop new ideas and groups that meet a communitiesrsquo need.Day service users were contacted by the council on March , after meetings were called by the Kelso and Jedburgh day service teams.However, Galashiels day service users have not been briefed as the council says the decommissioning of day services will ldquonot impact on Oakview in the same way.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos health chief Rob McCulloch-Graham, said: ldquoThe research carried out as part of our review of the provision of support services for older people showed us that the numbers of people using traditional day services was in decline and there was a growing preference for other more effective, localised options.ldquoWe therefore needed to look at introducing more robust, community based models that would enable us to improve options and outcomes for older people and their families.ldquoThe local area coordination approach was already proving successful for other client groups and we were confident that it would be equally beneficial for older adults.ldquoIt would also build on and expand the work of our community capacity building team who coordinate a wide range of popular activities and volunteering opportunities across the region, and our ongoing aim of providing a more community based day opportunity model.ldquoFollowing on from the introduction of the approach in Berwickshire, we are now asking the executive to note our intention to proceed with the expansion across the rest of the Borders, which will include meeting with day service users and their families to explain more about our plans and the benefits that the introduction of a new type of service could bring to them.ldquoBriefings have been held with those members of staff likely to be impacted by the proposals and these will be ongoing should we receive agreement to proceed."},{"url":null,"title":"the-herald-launches-free-online-access-to-students","story":"Accessto fact-based truth in society is a more pressing need than ever, Scotlandrsquos Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy has insisted.Kate Forbes MSPsaid that at a time when debate within society is becoming increasingly polarised, the ability to read reliable information would be vital.Her comments came as The Herald launched a new initiative to provide free access to heraldscotland across all colleges and universities in Scotland.It means any student or staff member who logs on to heraldscotland while connected to their campus wi can read its content free of charge.ldquoAccess to information, knowledge, fact and truth is more pressing than ever before, she said, ldquoand with The Heraldrsquos initiative they can provide that access to students and employees, which will hopefully set good habits for years to come.\"She added: ldquoThe Herald understands that easy access is critical.The new open access project issponsored by CGI, a technology consultancy group, and made possible by IT company JISC, who provide digital solutions for the UK education and research sector.The Herald has a long and strong relationship with Scotlandrsquos leading educational establishments.

development projects in the area.At the end of July, the group set off to host a development camp for young Malawian males to build confidence and leadership skills.Activities will include construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs pound, and the volunteering group hopes to seek sponsors for all .Denis added: ldquoWe are seeking sponsors for the  Malawian youths at pound each.ldquoAnd I would like to thank the Rotary clubs of

interval the choir embarked on a monumental performance of A German Requiem Op.  by Johannes Brahms, joined by the two South African pianists, Ben Schoeman and Tessa Uys, who played the alternative version prepared by Brahms as a piano duet for four hands on one keyboard, on this occasion the Melrose Music Societyrsquos Petrov piano.They gave a performance of scintillating musicality and power,

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"john-swinney-p1-testing-introduced-without-any-difficulty-whatsoever","story":"In an interview with The Herald, John Swinney argued any fall-out from the introduction of the Scottish National Standardised Assessmentswas political rather than educational.:John Swinney: lsquoI donrsquot see any narrowing of choice in schoolsrsquoBut opposition politicians, teaching unions and campaigners hit out at the statement accusing Mr Swinney of trying to rewrite history.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments for pupils in P, P, P and S as a response to falling standards of literacy and numeracy.Following their introduction in  there were reports of five-year-old pupils being left distressed while teachers complained of problems with IT systems.Some of the questions were deemed to be set at an inappropriate level of dficulty for pupils in P and charities warned the assessments were not in line with play-based learning and did not provide teachers with valuable data.But Mr Swinney told The Herald the introduction of the assessments had been a success and would soon be seen as a routine part of the school system.He said: \"Standardised assessments were a huge undertaking with over , in the first year, really without any dficulty of implementation whatsoever as a project, as an IT project and as a transactional exercise, and that is really quite a formidable achievement.:Teachers set to vote on cutting class time to . hours a week\"In terms of the assessments in P, P and S there is really no debate and they are actually addressing a nervousness in the educational profession about feeling confident about their judgements on the level of progression of a young person. What standardised assessments are doing is helping shape that confidence.\"There has obviously been a big debate about P, but frankly that has been more of a political debate than an educational debate because again, in year one, we have had over  per cent participation of P pupils in the standardised assessments and no real dficulty in the implementation of all of that.\"Mr Swinney said the SNSAs were an improvement on previous testing systems which were more demanding and not relevant to the Scottish curriculum.He added: \"Frankly, the P assessment debate has got a bit of traction because of politics. If people were so troubled about P assessments they should have been complaining about what  out of  local authorities have been doing for a long, long time and to a greater intensity than the Scottish National Standardised Assessments.\"Opposition politicians dismissed Mr Swinneys version of events arguing the assessments were \"a shambles\".Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said: \"This is dangerous hubris from an education secretary who has learned nothing from three years of gaffes, U-turns and climbdowns.\"Teachers say the assessments tell them nothing, parliament instructed Mr Swinney to drop them in P, an education committee report says they lack clarity of purpose, and educationalists say they leave us with no way to measure progress in literacy and numeracy.\"Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said it was \"simply not true\" to say the tests were introduced without any dficulty.She added: \"The recent evidence provided to Holyroodrsquos education committee makes clear that there were signicant issues raised by teachers and their professional associations, most especially about P tests, and several educationalists, including those with international experience, raised some doubts about whether there was clarity of purpose. It is also clear there have been concerns raised within several local authorities.\"Neither is it true to claim that the controversy is political. It is surely about the best educational interests of young people which is why the education committee chose to examine the issue in great detail.\"Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said it was clear Mr Swinney intended to press on with the assessments \"irrespective of teachers, educationalists and others who oppose his single minded utter disregard for the facts\".And Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said members were ldquounconvinced about the need for the assessments.He said: ldquoOur survey revealed the implementation created signicant issues in many schools and authorities around consistency of approach, IT challenges, and in particular the breaching by  out of  local authorities of national guidance on how the assessments should be delivered.\"P assessments have been shown to be inconsistent with a play based approach to learning and they need to go. In S the assessments are largely administered after pupils have made subject choices and been allocated to qualication streams so what is the point of them, other than to create a workload issue for teachers \"As far as the EIS is concerned, the educational benefit of SNSAs is unproven.Sue Palmer, from the charity Upstart Scotland, whch has opposed P testing, saidthe debate was lsquopoliticalrsquo because opposition parties had listened to the arguments against standardised assessments.She said: \"Therersquos a mass of evidence that standardised assessment of academic skills at such an early age is developmentally inappropriate, unlikely to provide reliable results and affects teaching practices in ways that can cause long-term damage for some children. This applies whether the data is collected at a national or local level.\"The UK is the only country in Europe that sends its children to school before the age of six and itrsquos only because of our absurdly early school starting age that we assume such young children should be cracking on with the three Rs.\"As countries like China and Singapore have recently recognised, the growing incidence of mental health problems among children and young people make it far more important to emphasis health and well-being during the early years.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mep-set-for-leading-role-in-european-parliament","story":"Mr Smith, , who was first elected to Brussels in , is today expected to become head of the -strong European Free Allianceof small Nationalist parties.Mr Smith is the longest serving member of the EFA, and it is the SNPrsquos turn to hold the position.More signicantly, as president of the EFA , Mr Smith is automatically vice-president of the larger Green-EFA bloc, which has  of the  MEPs in the parliament, giving it a powerful say in decisions.:Top SNP candidate open to an independent Scotland joining the euroMr Smith told an EFA meeting: ldquoHaving been here for  years, I will put myself forward for president of the group - to continue your good work and to make a commitment to stopping Brexit.He later told The National: ldquoThis is me making a commitment to the group, but it is also the group making a commitment to us.ldquoIt is a commitment in terms of lsquowe want Scotland to stayrsquo.

However, in the  Scottish Parliament election the SNP won the previously considered ldquoimpossible majority.So, what did Labour do next  Come the Scottish independence referendum, it urged the Scottish electorate to vote No, which as a Unionist party is only to be expected. However, it opposed independence in a formal coalition with the Conservatives, not only associating Labour with a political brand that has been in decline in Scotland for about  years, but to join in a campaign of hitherto unknown negativity. As Benjamin Franklin wrote, ldquoit takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it. Moreover, winning the independence referendum did it little good as less than a year later its  MPs were reduced to Ian Murrayrsquos Edinburgh South seat.Sir John Curtice wrote recently in a blog that the SNPrsquos  success was down ldquoto an apparent determination by those who had voted Yes to independence to affirm the choice they had made. Not only did Scotlandrsquos position in the Union now seem less secure than ever before, but Labourrsquos domination of Scotlandrsquos representation at Westminster had been reduced to rubble.While matters improved a little in  with seven Labour MPs being elected, the fact is that even that ldquotriumph increased its vote by only ,. Is this a comeback or a ldquodead cat bounce  Based on the EU election result, allied to many recent polls which suggest that in an election held any time soon, the SNP would win more than  seats again, it looks more like the latter.When a political party does badly, it is always possible ndash indeed arguably mandatory ndash that they identy someone to blame, but this is becoming serial for the Labour Party in Scotland, as since  Jack McConnell, Wendy Alexander, Iain Gray, Johan Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale have all come and gone to little positive effect.It is all very well to be blaming Mr Corbyn and his advisors for the failure of Labourrsquos EU Parliament campaign, but the fact is that this was a further failure, illustrating the truth of George Santayanarsquos claim that \"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\".Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE question about why the UK government should have a say in when Scotland holds another referendum on separation was unwittingly answered by Kirsty Blackman MP on BBC Scotlandrsquos Debate Night programme . Responding to a question on Brexit she said that she was not supporting the will of the people in this case because ldquoLeave was  and stated that it was ldquovery dficult to extricate yourself from a relationship with your closest trading partner.With all its dire warnings of \"clf-edge Tory Brexit\"we left the EU without a deal, it is surely inconceivable that the SNP would advocate holding a referendum without having negotiated a withdrawal agreement and future settlement with the remaining UK. This would make the Brexit negotiations seem like childs play and would tie up our politicians and civil servants for years, preventing progress on other vital legislation. Without detailed co-operation from Westminster, any attempt at a White Paper vision of Scotlandrsquos future would hold as much validity as a slogan on the side of a bus.The SNP has also expressed outrage that some EU citizens in UK were not able vote in the EU election. It wants over-s and EU citizens living in Scotland to be able to vote in an Indyref. If that is its moral position, then logically all Scots living in the rest of the UK and their offspring over , should also get to vote. This would require the UK Government to get all these people identied, registered and systems set up for voting.Holyrood cannot unilaterally impose all of this on the rest of the UK. The Westminster Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens both sides of the Border from any more uncertainty and ision at the very least until the Brexit outcome is clear.Mark Openshaw,Aberdeen AB.AS First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon seeks permission to have another Scottish independence referendum. The wording of the question to be asked has raised its head again, but this should be decided by the Electoral Commission and certainly not the SNP.One question that remains to be answered by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is: Why is Holyrood wasting essential parliamentary time on Indyref when Scotland has important pressing problems in health and education that the SNP has failed to resolve over the last  years Dennis Forbes Grattan,Aberdeen AB.ONE of the more interesting,not unusual, contenders in the Conservative leadership contest is Rory Stewart.

The present adversarial style has its merits ndash it can more readily produce the arguments on both sides of an issue as happens in the legalism of the court process ndash but in practice it degenerates into a permanent battle between the main political factions.Mr Stewart would bring a much-needed fresh approach to British politics. He appears to be someone who can listen politely to all sides before coming to a decision ndash resolute without being combative philosophical without being indecisive or dithering.Not only would this approach help to improve the present tarred relationship between the people and the politicians but it could assist in reversing the disdain which many currently have for the political system itself.Is there in all of this a bonus for the Conservatives  Could Mr Stewart rejuvenate the British Conservatives in the same way that Ruth Davidson has rejuvenated the Scottish Conservatives  The Conservative Party has survived as the oldest political party in the world simply because it is notconservative. It has always been willing, albeit sometimes reluctantly, to embrace change.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity dog walk to be held at haddo","story":"Employees of Nicol of Skene will be hosting a charity dog walk at Haddo Country Park in July.The event will be held on Sunday, July  at .am.The idea for the event was created through the love for dogs Nicol of Skene employees have and, their partnership with the cancer care charity, Friends of ANCHOR.The charity is one very close to many at Nicol of Skene.Richard Stott, Managing Director at Nicol of Skene, said: “Friends of ANCHOR are a very important charity in the North East of Scotland and unfortunately, many lives have been affected by cancer, our staff included. “The dog walk is a fantastic opportunity to have a great day out to raise money for a worthwhile cause.”Tickets for the charity dog walk cost £ per adult, £. per child and all dogs go free.The cost includes a sandwich, a bottle of water and all dogs participating will receive a free doggy goody bag.

The Charter – which was launched late last year – lays out the purpose and aims of Fair Trade as agreed by the two largest global Fair Trade organisations: the World Fair Trade Organisation and Fairtrade International.The new document refreshes the vision of Fair Trade and more closely aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goalsby highlighting Fair Trade’s longstanding role in addressing challenges covered by the SDGs, including inequality, gender rights, and climate change. The Charter lays out the unique approach, achievements and impacts of Fair Trade and illustrates how inclusive economic growth, fair wages and better working conditions can be achieved while empowering women and ensuring opportunities for the next generation.Aberdeenshire became the seventeenth Fairtrade Zone in , contributing to Scotland becoming a Fairtrade Nation.The area’s current Fairtrade Zone status continues until May , and one of the points in the Council’s Environment and Climate Change Policy states a commitment to develop an approach to ensure that local environmental, social and economic issues relating to the health and fair treatment of people are considered while also strengthening Aberdeenshire as a Fairtrade Zone.Following its decision last week, chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Sustainability Committee, Colin Pike, said: “Pledging support for the new International Fair Trade Charter further demonstrates Aberdeenshire Council’s commitment to the global Fair Trade movement.“We as a Sustainability Committee and as a Council fully endorse the aims and refreshed vision for Fair Trade in the ever-changing world we live in, and in line with our Environment and Climate Change Policy.” Vice chair, Isobel Davidson, added: “Aberdeenshire Council has been committed to the Fair Trade movement for a number of years now in ious capacities, and pledging our support for this new International Charter is a further demonstration of our continued advocacy going forward.”Aberdeenshire Council is also a member of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum . The Forum was established in January  to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland.The SFTF is encouraging other local authorities and public bodies to recognise the International Fair Trade Charter as a common reference document for the global Fair Trade movement.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Junior Doric Verse competitors\"  Society hosts Strichen Festival viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"mp praises extension of apprentice programme","story":"Gordon MP Colin Clark has praised Aberdeenshire Council for #ambitious# plans to extend the Foundation Apprenticeship programme to more school pupils across the local area.The Scottish Conservative made the comments following a visit with Cllr Gillian Owen toan employer in his constituency that has taken on the first apprentice through the scheme.SengS of Ellon part of the Pryme Group, an engineering firm in the Balmcassie Commercial Park, took on Ellon Academy pupil Callum Turnball as a Foundation Apprentice .The FA is a qualication – over one or two years – that let’s pupils gain work experience within one of Scotland’s  growth industries while still attending school.The apprentices spend one day or two half days a week working with a local employer, learning some of the skills required for a future career.Mr Clark said: “SengS is a great example of a growing company here in the north-east of Scotland with world-class skills.“Callum is the company’s first apprentice taken on since Aberdeenshire Council became a Foundation Apprenticeship provider. “The council recently received £million from Skills Development Scotland to develop the programme and encourage more young people into work while they are studying.“Apprentices are in many ways the leblood of industry and governments at all levels should be doing all we can to increase vocational training and job opportunities for our young people.“We are fortunate here in the north-east to have a thriving economy with many good local employers.“The council’s ambitious plans to get more young people into vocational training should be welcomed.”Cllr Gillian Owen, Ellon  District councillor and chair of education and children services at Aberdeenshire Council, said: “FAs provide a unique opportunity for our young people and I hope other local employers will follow the lead taken by Sengs.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Resource Centre is one of the Aberdeenshire Day Service sites\"  Council day care services praised after inspection viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch are the lib dems tory lite or truly radical","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Buoyant party must find distinctive policies and a leader capable of commanding the UK stage, writes Lesley Riddoch.Liberal Democrats are suddenly news again – dangerous enough to warrant Labour’s instant expulsion of nose-holding supporter Alastair Campbell but appealing enough to notch up a remarkable opinion poll first. \u2028Last week YouGov put the Lib Dems on  per cent, with the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories and Labour tied on  per cent. Even though that lead evaporated in the latest Opinium poll , they’re still celebrating a first UK top spot in nine years.: Dani Garavelli: ‘I disagree with Jo’ moment a bad start for SwinsonThe good news for the Lib Dems is that English Remain voters have either forgotten their part in imposing university tuition fees and austerity or decided there are bigger Brexit fish to fry. Whatever the reason, the party most used to losing deposits is riding high. But will they be able to capitalise on this opportunity without the weel kent face of Sir Vince Cable at the helm  : Jo Swinson: I will take on ‘independence obsessed’ SNPThe battle to replace him as leader at the end of July is a modest affair compared with the Tories’ -strong line-up. It features just two candidates: Sir Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Nominations close on  June, the day Theresa May bids a tearful farewell. But at that point the Lib Dems must decide what kind of party they really are – nasty or nice Tory-lite or genuinely radical a one-trick, anti-Brexit pony or a vigorous and serious potential government. It won’t be as easy as it looks. The party’s moment in the sun may finally have arrived but beyond “Bollocks to Brexit” it’s not clear the party has a winning slogan, distinctive policies or a new leader capable of commanding the UK stage.Take Sir Ed Davey, whose radical credentials are surely damaged by taking a gong from the Tories in consolation for losing his seat after the coalition debacle. Sir Ed’s record as energy minister is underwhelming from a Scottish perspective. Subsidies for community hydro and solar  were cut and vital subsea connectors to the Northern and Western Isles vetoed because islanders wouldn’t knuckle down and build vast wind farms tode-risk the project and simply the budgeting process. Even though Alistair Carmichael was Scottish Secretary at the time, the long-awaited Northern Isles cables weren’t built on the Lib Dems’ watch. Mind you, Sir Ed did approve connectors to Norway and Ireland instead. Nice. He also introduced contracts for dferencein place of subsidies for onshore and offshore wind plus marine renewables. Somehow Scots firms have won only a handful of these contracts and a new island-shaped CfD was only introduced last week. Soon after losing his seat in , Ed was knighted and joined the PR firm that represents EDF Energy. EDF had just been awarded the contract to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by… Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey. Oh, yes, and Sir Ed supports fracking too. This is what passes for a radical record on tackling climate change in England.Anyway, back to Brexit – doubtless the Lib Dems’ strongest card. Sir Ed wants to use “the Cooper-Letwin process” so the Brexit default is Revoke rather than No Deal on \u2028 October. Whoop, whoop. When the crowd-funded Revoke Article  legal action failed its first hurdle in February , Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine promptly quit. Happily for MPs, all are now legally entitled to press the Revoke button, thanks to the tenacity, vision and co-operative capacity of the original petitioners in the Green, SNP and Labour parties. Without their constancy when the going got rough, Ms Jardine’s colleague Lib Dem MP Tom Brake would not have been able to join the posse in the latter stages and give the Lib Dems a democratic name-check. Poor.Meanwhile Sir Ed’s sole opponent, Jo Swinson, announced her candidacy on last week’s Question Time, taking a pop at the SNP’s failure to close the educational attainment gap. The MP for East Dunbartonshire cited figures from the Scottish Index on Multiple Deprivationwhich suggests only  per cent of children in Govan go on to higher education. This immediately provoked a social media storm, not least from Govan High’s headteacher who cited more recent figures which show the school’s actually doing pretty well. Was this an own goal or just plain baffling  Well, it would be usefula Holyrood statistician could explain how such wildly dfering stats can attach to roughly the same educational cohort. It would also be pointless to maintain that income doesn’t play a shamefully large part in determining access to opportunity in Scotland. But that’s why roughly half the population supports Scottish independence so all policy decisions, tax levers, benefit levels and income streams are under Scottish control, all ability to offload responsibility are at an end and a truly concerted sht of resources can tackle Dickensian levels of poverty, generated by David Cameron’s Con-Dem coalition government. Just for the record, both Sir Ed and Ms Swinson were members – she voted  times for the bedroom tax, five times against raising benefits in line with inflation, seven times for disability cuts and  times for general welfare cuts. But bygones…Even though the SIMD figures do exist, the statistical basis of her Question Time rebuke was dodgy, the “Milngavie air of superiority”was snfy, the “forced breeziness” a little wearing and the choice of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s seat as a target was negative and predictable. If Ms Swinson aims to outdo Ruth Davidson with high octane attacks on the SNP’s record in office, good luck. The SNP isn’t perfect. But politicians in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. And thanks to the Lib Dems’ disastrous involvement with the Tories, shatterproof glass only covers them south of the Border for the single issue of Brexit. Even there, they must share the honours as second vote champions with the UK Greens. In Scotland, the latest poll puts them in fourth on just  per cent. And this despite winning a seat in recent European elections.If it’s too late to bring on a fresh face, the Lib Dems must find a fresh approach. Otherwise, it’s not just the big two parties that face political oblivion – ultimately, the big two-dependent Lib Dems will become political casualties as well. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence labour msp says snp needs fresh mandate for indyref2","story":"A senior Labour figure has told the SNP to seek a \"fresh mandate\" for another independence referendum in the  Holyrood elections.Former Labour deputy leader Alex Rowley said no politician should block a second vote on Scotland leaving the UKthere is a majority among Scots for such a vote - but this isnt the case the moment.Mr Rowley was addressing MSPs during a debate on Scotlands economy and said Nicola Sturgeons proposal to hold another referendum next year - without knowing the full implications of Brexit - is \"irresponsible.\"He added: \"We will not know enough to make an informed choice about the Brexit consequences of any independence referendum to take place before .\"England, after all, is our largest trading partner.

Fishermen will always need a market for their landings and remote farmers and crofters know Europe tries to look after them even though nationally agribusiness seeks to pocket too much subsidy. Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters. What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

It was really satisfying, there were no TVs, no gaming machines, managing there was all about conversation.”Gerry spoke of how the initial spark of the Jawbox brand came about due to his “wee bit of entrepreneurial spirit” – the ‘spirit’ being his drink of choice.“In all the years I’ve worked in bars the only spirit I’ve ever liked was gin. I had the idea of producing my own gin, bringing out my own brand. If it didn’t work I was more than happy to stay on as a barman, I would’ve always regretted never giving it a go.”Gerry said the process took over two and a half years from the concept to getting the name registered.“I did come close to giving up but all the right people came together, the absolute best of the best, with Echlinville distiller Shane Branf, his head distiller Graham Miller and packaging and branding coming from Drinksology. Everything started to move dead fast.”The launch night of Jawbox took place in late February  – “a night of one of the worst storms, so I wasn’t hopeful people were going to turn up” – at the Linehall Library, with a little help from the then Lord Mayor Arder Carson.“I didn’t want to launch Jawbox in a bar, every other bar would’ve gone ‘Well, why didn’t you launch it in my bar ’ I wanted something ‘old Belfast’ and at the start Linenhall [Library] told me that didn’t really do launches as such. I loved the setting and told them I had the Lord Mayor on board – I just had to ask him,” he laughed.“I then went over to City Hall and said ‘Any chance of speaking to the Lord Mayor ’ The staff were brilliant and Arder came over and fair play as he likes a brandy.“The next day, when it was being rolled out, I think almost every bar in Belfast took it.”In the event, over  people turned up to support Gerry that night – “one of their own”Jawbox is now served in bars across Ireland, has its own mural in Kelly’s Cellars, is the go-to spirit at Belfast International Airport, is served across the water as well as its signature label displayed in over , retail outlets in England, Wales and Scotland.Recently awarded Supplier of the Year at the Institute of Hospitality Awards at Titanic Belfast, Gerry was one of five artisan suppliers chosen to showcase his product at a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at the Grand Central on Wednesday.“The name comes from my granny, Maisie, Maisie Cunningham, who would always say to us ‘In my day we all stood round the jawbox and did our washing,’ as not everyone had the pleasure or the luxury of having their own shared washing area. Everything would have been washed in a big Belfast sink, clothes, dishes, the baby –everything was washed in it. People shared their stories, told their tales, it was their jaws going round the box. I always say to people to this very day, when they have parties, where do people go  The kitchen. Everybody stands around the sink.”It’s evident just how much pride and enthusiasm Gerry has for the product that has grown at a speed he never foresaw just three years ago.“The award for Supplier of the Year meant an amazing amount to me, it was my fth time being shortlisted, twice for Jawbox, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. It was fantastic.”The -year-old says the power to promote Jawbox via social media is “amazing”.“There are places Jawbox is appearing that I would never know. Philip Schofield posted a bottle to his Snapchat, everybody was ringing me saying ‘did you see it  Did you see it ’”Having grown up in C­onway Street and later Lenadoon, Gerry has his base just off Queen’s University Belfast. “Where will the next three years take Jawbox ” I ask him. He replies: “The States.”“You only get one chance in America. It’s a matter of making sure we have the right importer, distributor. Sean Muldoon and Jack McCarty from the Dead Rabbit are out there who are going to be so supportive. I used to work with Sean in the Northern Whig. “Just two weeks ago Jawbox was used as the reception drink for the Irish Film Festival in Australia, we launched in Sweden.”Inbetween “surprising” those who take part in weekly ‘Gin Jaunts’ every Saturday afternoon as part of the extremely popular Taste and Tour experience, Gerry hosts Jawbox gin evenings at ious hotels were he shares his passion with others keen to hear how Jawbox was born.“I was really surprised to see how many young people turn up to these events. I nearly dropped when someone asked me to sign a bottle recently.“What I set out to do from the start was build a legacy, make the product authentic, that’s why my signature is on the bottle. I knew from the start that the quality of this product had to be better than anything  out there.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PIPS-families.png","title":"pips families provide helping hand to each other","story":"NORTH Belfast suicide prevention charity PIPS has been to the forefront over the years in providing support to iniduals who are considering or who have at some point considered ending their own lives.PIPS also provide support to families and friends who have been touched by suicide, with their family group the driving force behind such support.PIPS Family Group Meeting takes place every Wednesday night from pm to pm in Tesco at Cityside.The group is currently made up of seven members, all women who have lost a family relative to suicide.Two such members are Patricia Perry, who lost her son Johnin , andAnne McKenna, wholost her son Broguein .Patricia explained how she involved in the group.“My son died  years ago. PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid would make grand gesture to irish government by covering costs of new digitised border in ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":null,"title":"answering press questions could jeopardise powersharing talks says karen bradley","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Although there has been no deadline given to the current talks process, Mrs Bradley suggested there could be no extension. MP Gavin Robinson had raised the prospect of an extension helping to pave the way to finding an agreement.  She refused to discuss the consequences of failure.In August powers allowing civil servants to make decisions expire.Read MoreNarrow window to get agreement on restoring powersharing at Stormont, MPs toldKaren Bradley: We must seize our narrow window of opportunity to restore the AssemblyFollowing her statement, Mrs Bradley took questions from those MPs in the Commons - something she had persistently refused to do with the Press. She said she was happy to engage with the Press and believed in Press freedom, but said she would continue to refuse to discuss matters surrounding the talks.The Labour MP and acting chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee Kate Hoey told Karen Bradley it looked bad when she does not answer questions and the \"Foreign Secretary of the Republic of Ireland [Simon Coveney] answers questions for half an hour\".\"I want to see devolution restored, that is my priority.

On this particular matter I dont think we gain anything by speculating and having an over analysis of answers.\"Sammy Wilson went further saying her refusal to engage with the Press while Mr Coveney took a dferent approach gave the impression the talks were \"driven by the Irish Republic and not in the hands of the UK Government\".\"And that is in breach of the three-stranded approach there should be when it comes to these talks,\" he said.It is important the parties have the space to discuss these issues to build trust.Karen BradleyMrs Bradley responded: \"The more speculation in the Press and where about these matters the less chance we have of restoring government. That is the view I take. \"And I am not prepared to do anything that jeopardises the possibility of restoring government. It is a matter for other politicians as to the approach they take in terms of dealing with the Press. \"I have the utmost respect for the Press as the former culture secretary I was an advocate for Press freedom and the Press are very welcome to scrutinise and question me atas they regularly do. \"But on these matters I am not prepared to do anything that makes it harder for his party and others to do what they want to do which is go back into government.\"Mrs Bradley said \"good progress\" had been made in the talks which had been constructive, but there were issues to overcome which would require \"give and take on both sides\" and accommodation to broker agreement on what were \"complex and sensitive issues\".\"I am grateful with the constructive manner in which they have engaged with the process and with each other and hopeful collective leadership will continue through the next phase,\" she said.\"It is important the parties have the space to discuss these issues to build trust and relationships and find common ground and compromise.\"The parties have been split into working groups dealing with five issues. Those being: programme for government transparency and operation of the Executive Petition of Concern reform rights, language and identity and improving the sustainability, stability and operation of the institutions. Pressed by DUP MP Jim Shannon on how the secretary of state intended to improve the institutions to prevent one party blocking devolution, Mrs Bradley said it was up to the parties and her government would facilitate any change to legislationthat was needed.The minister said the killing of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry was a \"stark warning\" peace and stability was not put in jeopardy.\"I am under no illusions, the people of Northern Ireland need and deserve to see ing political institutions up and running.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle.

They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me. We then had the Innovation Nation event, bringing many young people from our schools together to see the exciting advances in the business opportunities that are presented to them going forward.Mr Murnin said he was also involved in helping fundraise for brave Bessbrook girl Ellen Treanor and six-year Alfie Pentony from Newry who will both travel to the US for pioneering health treatment.Sadly for the former chairman, rain intervened last August and the annual Festival of Flight international air show in Newcastle was cancelled.On a serious note, he told those in the chamber that a great responsibility comes with being a councillor.ldquoAs you strive to make this district the number one place to do business and set up a home, itrsquos worth remembering that those across the council chamber are not necessarily the enemy mdash you all must work together for the betterment of our district, he said.ldquoDuring my recent visit to New York, I was able to see how investors view the world and it was interesting to see where they see opportunities and risks, in particular.ldquoOne of those was climate risk and the importance of it, with businesses looking at it from an investors point of view. As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees. This is something we should look to replicate where we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Foster sisters and Alex shine at schools’ event  ","story":"THE Newry Mourne and Down Primary Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships were held in Kilbroney Forest Park last Tuesday.Jodi Foster was first in the P girls and her sister Kari was second in the P girls.

His young  year-old jockey, Sean Armitage, was giving the horse a work-out gallop in preparation for the Sligo race meeting when he suddenly felt the horse jerk.Moments later they saw blood trickling down the neck of the horse and after finding a small hole they realised that a bullet had done the damage.

However, they have not discovered who fired the bullet.ldquoThe future of the horse is very much in the balance, said an unhappy Mr Treacey. ldquoThe bullet is lodged close to the horsersquos spine and my vet has suggested a very tricky operation is needed to remove it.ldquoWorse still, it could easily have been my jockey who was hit.

Out of the  people I asked, only one felt they were being represented at Stormont.ldquoI have decided to speak out and am working with others on my campaign. Rather than talk about doing something, I am going down this road because I believe that action is stronger than words.Mr Morgan says he is attempting to ascertainthere is consensus among the people of Northern Ireland for political change and politicians who want to work together for everyonersquos benefit.ldquoI am throwing my idea out there for people to stop what they are doing on June  between pm and .pm to show their frustration at what is currently happening, he explained. ldquoPolitical stagnation and climate change are crucial issues that we must do something about.ldquoI hope that people in every town, village and hamlet across this district and throughout Northern Ireland, including post-primary school students and those who attend further education colleges and universities, will take part.Mr Morgan said he wants residents and those who work in shops and offices to demonstrate that they want change.ldquoJune  is an opportunity for people to demand change, equal rights and equality.

I want people to select a venue in their own area and meet there in silence for just a short period to send out a clear message that they have had enough and are demanding change, he continued.ldquoI am particularly keen to see students taking part as they are the future. We need to listen to what they have to say, particularly with regard to the future of local politics and the planet. We have not had a government in this country for two years which is disgraceful. I believe that our MLAs have effectively disqualied themselves from public office.He argued Northern Ireland, which was once a world leader in many fields, particularly engineering, needed a system of government which was not run along ldquoorange and green lines.He continued: ldquoWe want our country to be a world leader again, this time in agreeing political solutions and addressing the issue of climate change. I believe that we need a system of government which is based on non-party politics.ldquoParty politics across the globe has failed and in all my  years I have never had a government that represented me or indeed one that I had respect for. This has to end. We need a government for everyone which comprises independent members bringing their own particular strengths to the table.ldquoThere is no point calling for change and standing back. We have to make this happen with human rights and equality for everyone, regardless of their religion, political view, sexual preferences or colour of their skin. We need government by the people for the people.He added: ldquoI hope people will grasp the opportunity they are being offered on June .

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief. We are also grateful to our parents for their continued support and loyalty.The Bishopscourt playgroup will be taking part in a sponsored bag pack at the Asda supermarket in Downpatrick this Saturday between am and pm.

If you havenrsquot been to Meelmore Lodge lately, then go check it out. A signicant amount of investment has been done there and therersquos great parking facilities and easy access to the Ulster Way under the shadow of Meelmore .Therersquos accommodation there, including pods and plenty of camping spaces - great for a night out. The race exited the campsite with the organisers issuing strict instructions for runners not to cross walls or fences, except through an open gate where a marshal would be there to direct them.Wet tops were the order of the day, for while it was mild and dry, but there were a few ominous grey clouds around and once up near to , feet the climate conditions can be much more challenging.By the way, one of the race directorsdecided it would be wise to recce the course earlier in the week.So on Monday evening meeting at the above-mentioned stunning Meelmore Lodge, he gathered with a few so-called running mates. They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday.

At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellSerious crash update: One person taken to hospital and road reopened to trafficOne of N.I.s busiest roads to shutdown within the next  minutes*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Emma Thomas, chief executive of charity YoungMinds, described the figures as ldquoalarming. The study provides the first evidence of long-term trends in non-suicidal self-harm in England, the researchers said.Lead author Sally McManus, from the National Centre for Social Research, said: ldquoNon-suicidal self-harm is increasingly being reported as a way of coping.

I had the idea one Sunday night whilst watching TV. The initial plan was just a sponsored park run k, that led to ‘a why not make this a bit bigger and get St Peters involved’, a couple of phone calls with Ciaran McCavigan at St Peter’s and we had the bones of a plan.”Initial planning started straight away at the end of March with a lot of work between the clubs to coordinate with council PSNI etc.The Rugby Club and St Peter’s have been making great strides in reaching across the communities in Lurgan as David explained: “The friendship between the clubs started back a couple of years ago when Lurgan RFC contacted St Peter’s about getting a joint code session for the kids, this developed into our game of two halves and we’ve kept that up by having afixture in St Peter’s, this joint venture made lots of sense as it brought us together in a non-contested space i.e. Lurgan Park“It’s really important to stress that both the guys in St Peter’s and the Tigers see our joint projects as being something that will be long term, we aren’t interested in short term publicity or gains there is a firm commitment on both sides to deliver opportunities for all our kids and young people to interact and play sport together in a fun environment.David said the response has been Really positive so far with the PSNI, Council and Lord Mayor’s office all “really enthused”. Local businesses have got behind it too with Tesco Lurgan supplying fruit, People First snack boxes and River Rock water for participants: “People seem to really get on board with the cross community aspect and the whole concept, the support has been obvious from everyone who’s sponsored one of the kids.A total of around  are expected to take part in the run, start from the clubs at .pm. There will be relay runners leaving respective clubs and meeting in the centre of the town in the plaza at Market St , the last relay runners will exchange a football and a rugby ball in lieu of a baton before all the participants head down Windsor Avenue together to start the actual route in the park, It’s about k in the park for older kids and a shorter easier route for younger members.David said: “We hope everyone will join us afterwards at the fountain for refreshments, a bit of craic and hopefully a few rugby and footballs on the go.“We reckon this will be a very successful event that helps show what sport can do to bring communities together. It’s been great to work with Ciaran to get the run organised and we are already thinking of what we can do to build on this idea.”Translink display at Lurgan show ahead of railway line closure

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.
