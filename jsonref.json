In 2015, women did 248 minutes - four hours and eight minutes - of unpaid work a day on average, with men doing just over half of that - 139 minutes, about two hours twenty minutes. Men also do more paid work than women averaging 344 minutes a day in 2015 compared to women\u0027s 246 minutes. And in one aspect of daily life - leisure time - gender parity has actually worsened. Men and women both enjoyed roughly 4 hours and 50 minutes of leisure time in 1961 but in 2015 men had around 45 minutes more each day, while women\u0027s leisure time only increased by five minutes.\u0027It seems to have levelled off,\u0027 Sullivan writes. \u0027Gender attitudes are changing in the acceptance of greater equality, but, for instance, when parental leave is available very few men take it up.           When it comes to sleep, both men and women are actually getting more sleep than in 1961\u0027And women still seem to be considered — and consider themselves — responsible for the household chores.\u0027Comparing the 2015 data from that of the year 2000, Gershuny and Sullivan concluded that there is \u0027little evidence for any speed-up in the tempo of daily activities\u0027. In fact, far fewer people reported that they \u0027always felt rushed\u0027 in 2015 than in 2000.  The authors also pointedly observed that there was a time when we always want to seem busy as a signal of our social status. \u0027That particular thing of being very upfront about how busy you were is less of a marker of social status now than it used to be,\u0027 Gershuny writes.         It is true however, that although the average family spends as much time together today as they did in 2000, there has been a decrease in \u0027engaged\u0027 time - when families actually interact rather than just spend time in each other\u0027s presence.              Men are doing more unpaid work, such as childcare, gardening and housework, since 1961 but still not as much as womenThis has been partly attributed to a decline in families doing household tasks and watching television together, as well as the rise in smartphones and other personal digital devices.     When it comes to sleep, both men and women are actually getting more sleep than in 1961. In 2015 men and women spent on average 8 hours and 30 minutes sleeping in bed, an increase of 15 minutes for women and 45 minutes for men.\u0027The question to ask is why is it that there\u0027s this perception that sleep has decreased?,\u0027 the authors ask.  \u0027It\u0027s one of these things where you have an expectation: A 247 society means you sleep less,\u0027 and yet that is demonstrably not the case.  Gershuny and Sullivan conclude in What We Really Do All Day that the \u0027speeded-up\u0027 and 247 society may be little more than a myth.\u0027The idea of a generalised speed-up in our time may actually be more of a folk narrative about rapid changes in society than a real experience of our daily lives,\u0027 they write.What We Really Do All Day, Insights from the Centre For Time Use Research by Jonathan Gershuny and Oriel Sullivan, published by Pelican Books, will be released on June 27 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f1ab8cd114751c846e085a9353cb64f8c9e437/0_196_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=737f49d07af926953c12be003055ceb3","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph dawn at glastonbury festival june 2017","story":"This week in our  Print Shop series, photographer David Levene captures festival-goers greeting the dawn at GlastonburyDawn breaks at Glastonbury festival’s stone circle in June 2017, as captured by the  photographer David Levene.

Everyone is apparently related, their stepfather’s cousin seems to be a witch and, of course, there are the stories of the girls who have gone missing there, year after year. Madeline and Catlin think they will be safe, though they look out for each other. Salty hilarity and an assured evocation of siblings’ prickly closeness give way to unnerving folk-horror menace and gore in Sullivan’s latest lush, weird and lyrical book.From gal-dem, an award-winning magazine created by women and non-binary people of colour, come essays and stories in which contributors write to their teenage selves as kindly, validating mentors. From Niellah Arboine’s “‘You Speak Well for a Black Girl’: Black Is Who You Are” to Sara Jafari’s emphasis on choice and autonomy when dating as a British Muslim, the pieces are warm, personal and sometimes traumatic. The authors assert their right to their own history, feelings and experience, and their refusal to be ignored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be4bfb1278d29d1055cd96c8f1e6e5f63a94eb6b/0_28_1936_1161/master/1936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c0da4212003558bcc1f936ee4dcc2fb","title":"fukushima diary part three restoring crops and a sense of pride","story":"The mayor of Okuma, home of the damaged nuclear power plant, has been in exile for eight years – here he writes about finally returningMy family home is in the Ogawara neighbourhood of Okuma. The radiation levels there were deemed low enough for the government to lift the evacuation order for that part of the town in April this year, eight years after every single resident was forced to leave. My house, which stood empty for all that time, is being refurbished and I will be able to move back in August.It’s a big old house and needs a lot of work. All of the walls and roof have to be removed as they were badly damaged in the earthquake. Other parts will have to be renovated. The workmen will also strengthen its foundations and rebuild the outer walls. It would have been cheaper and quicker to demolish the house and build a new one on the same plot of land. But I decided against that as I was determined to keep at least some of the house that my father built 60 years ago.My father was always eager to learn. He studied new farming methods at university in Tokyo, and tried his hand at poultry farming and aquaculture, which were almost unheard of in those days. As his eldest son, I was expected to follow in his footsteps and work in agriculture. It seemed only natural to me that that’s what I would do.I spent two years away from Okuma when I studied at an agricultural college in Sendai. My father and I had disagreements when I was young, but I eventually came round to his way of thinking about the importance of protecting our home and keeping it in the family. Now I say exactly the same thing to my son.I like the Japanese saying seiko udoku – which means working in the fields when the sun is shining and staying at home reading when it rains. So when I finally return to my own home in Okuma, I’m going to get involved in farming again, but this time as a hobby.The fields we own have been decontaminated, but because they haven’t been used for eight years they need to be restored to a state fit for growing crops. Eventually I’d like to keep chicken and sheep, and grow mushrooms. I get secretly excited whenever I think about it.It breaks my heart to think that our residents have been ided into those who can come home and those who can’t. The latter must be tempted to think that they have been left behind while other people are able to return to their clean homes.A conversation I had with someone I know in the town left a real impression on me. She had been told that she could, in fact, return as long as she moved to a neighbourhood where the evacuation order had been lifted. But she said: “I don’t just want to return to Okuma I want to return and live in my old house in Okuma.”I know exactly how she feels, and so do the other people who want to return to Okuma. When I think about people in that predicament I can’t feel completely happy about my own situation.From now on, we will try to revive our hometown in two ways. First, every single resident, including those who may have given up on ever living in Okuma again, will be able to return whenever they like. And second, we will build a town that will attract people who have never lived here.We have always taken great pride in the hard work everyone put into building Okuma into a great place to live. I am sure that the same sense of pride will continue to help us as we rebuild our town and make it an even better place.I will spend the rest of my life doing everything I can to get our old town back. My seiko udoku hobby can wait if necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

That moment caught the imagination of the journalist Bill McKibben, who has written and campaigned on climate breakdown ever since.

This more classic take echoes the natural sweetness of corn in the best possible way, in a sweetsalty combination that’s ideal for breakfast or brunch. Avocado, in any shape or form, will work well alongside. 210g unsalted butter, cut in half210g quick-cook polenta 210g plain flour1¾ tsp salt1 tbsp baking powder⅓ tsp bicarbonate of soda450g fresh corn kernels (from about 3 cobs), or the equivalent in frozen kernels, defrosted3 tbsp runny honey, plus extra to serve200g Greek-style yoghurt80ml whole milk3 eggs, beaten20g chives, finely choppedBlack pepperHeat the oven to 220C (210C fan)450Fgas 7. Put the butter in a 28cm-diameter cast-iron saute pan, then put it in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until melted and browned. Pour all but a tablespoon and a half of the butter into a bowl and set the pan aside.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the polenta, flour, salt, baking powder and bicarb.Put the corn in a food processor and pulse a few times, until roughly chopped, then tip into a large bowl and add the honey, yoghurt, milk, eggs, chives and a generous amount of pepper, whisking to combine.Tip the corn mixture and the bowl of browned butter into the dry ingredients, and stir through until just combined but not overmixed.Transfer the mixture to the buttered cast-iron pan you used earlier, smoothing out the top with the back of a spoon, and bake for 25 minutes, or until the bread is golden and brown around the edges, and a skewer comes out clean from the centre. Leave to cool in the pan for at least 45 minutes before serving, with more honey drizzled on top, if you like.Poha (or powa) is cooked, flattened and dried rice. You can find it in most Asian grocery stores, and make sure you get the thick flakes, not the thin ones, because they’re more likely to hold their shape. Poha is widely used in Indian cookery and is typically served at breakfast. Here, I’ve taken the traditional base and turned it into a savoury flan that would work as a breakfast or light lunch with some smashed avocado or yoghurt alongside.Put the poha in a bowl, cover with plenty of cold water and soak for three minutes. Drain and set aside.Put four tablespoons of oil in a large, ovenproof saute pan for which you have a lid, and put it on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the onion, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until softened and browned. Add the garlic, ginger, chopped chilli, spices and curry leaves, and cook for two minutes more, stirring often, until fragrant.Add the cooked potato, a teaspoon of salt, plenty of pepper and two tablespoons of water, and cook for two minutes, stirring regularly. Turn down the heat to medium-low, then add the poha and stir to combine. Cover and leave to steam, undisturbed, for three minutes, until the poha is cooked through. Stir through the lime juice and two-thirds of the coriander, then tip out into a bowl and leave to cool slightly for about 15 minutes.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Whisk together the eggs, coconut milk and half a teaspoon of salt, then stir them into the cooled poha mixture.Wipe out the saute pan, add a tablespoon and a half of oil and swirl the pan around to coat its base and sides. Add the poha mixture, spreading it out to distribute it evenly, then bake for 15 minutes, or until just set. Remove and leave to cool slightly – about 10 minutes.While the poha is cooling, make the topping. In a small bowl, mix the fresh coconut, peanuts, sliced red chilli, remaining coriander and lime zest. To serve, top the poha flan with the coconut mixture, then drizzle over the remaining teaspoon and a half of oil and serve directly from the pan.Apart from the ricotta, this simple pie also has dolcelatte (which is mild enough not to offend even if you’re not the biggest blue cheese fan) and parmesan in the filling, which make it rich and complex enough to serve at the centre of a light supper with a simple lettuce salad by way of accompaniment.25g unsalted butter1 tbsp olive oil1 medium onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced 500g swiss chard, stems and leaves separated, stems cut into 1cm slices, leaves shredded3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushedSalt and black pepper1 egg, beaten, plus 1 egg yolk 50g parmesan, finely grated150g dolcelatte, roughly crumbled4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced1 rectangular 34cm x 24cm sheet puff pastry100g ricotta2 tsp nigella seedsHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Put the butter and oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and fry, stirring occasionally, until softened and well browned – about 10 minutes.Add the chard stems, cook for four minutes more, or until softened, then stir in the chard leaves, garlic, three quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for a further four minutes, until the leaves have wilted and released some of their liquid.Turn off the heat, leave to cool for 20 minutes, then stir in the whole egg, parmesan, dolcelatte and spring onions.Line the base and sides of a 32cm x 22cm rectangular baking tin with a sheet of greaseproof paper. Drape the puff pastry on top, making sure it covers the bottom of the tin and extends about 2½cm up the sides (trim the edges, if need be), then gently push the pastry down to fit the tin. Top with the chard mixture, spreading it evenly to cover the base, then dot randomly with tablespoonfuls of ricotta.Fold over the edges of the pastry, so you have an outer rim about 2½-3cm thick, and press the corners together to seal. Brush the rim with the beaten egg yolk, then sprinkle the nigella seeds on top. Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and the pastry is cooked through, then leave to cool for about 15 minutes before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7619859ebc9590f9ab8324080c7fac75f47628c/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d15c2c80e22b3becabd1d4ebdd54f9","title":"women world cup 2019 power rankings usa england","story":"The question after USA’s 13-0 win against Thailand – in which Alex Morgan scored five – and 3-0 victory over Chile was whether they could do it against tougher opponents. A cruising 2-0 defeat of Sweden in their final Group F game, albeit both already having qualified, went part of the way to answering that. Of course sterner tests are to come but the swaggering, confident performances shown so far have all the hallmarks of champions.Corinne Diacre’s home side came out of the blocks with intent against South Korea. Since then the journey has been harder fought and has benefited from some much discussed – though correct – VAR decisions. The Lyon spine has been vital to their perfect start. When Diacre has shuffled the pack, though, the team’s flow has looked disrupted, prompting questions about whether the squad is deep enough.The first England team to finish a World Cup group stage with top marks since 1982 has shown flashes of genius. But consistency across 90 minutes has been a problem. Phil Neville’s heavy rotation policy has been successful thus far but, with tougher tests on the horizon, there is a feeling he needs to settle a little more on a first-choice XI. Will he be bold and hand some of the impressive fringe stars a more central role?The Dutch will concede and at the back they look disorganised. But further forward they have the most potent attack in the World Cup in their new all-time top-scorer Vivianne Miedema, Lieke Martens, Shanice van de Sanden and Danielle van de Donk. Two against Canada – who had conceded only once in 2019 – to top the group showed they are a serious force.In a group alongside Australia and Brazil few would have penned Italy as table toppers. Exploiting the weakness of the Australian defence to come from behind to win showed a much stronger side than expected. Eight of the Italian squad play for two-year-old and two-time title winners Juventus, including Cristiana Girelli and Barbara Bonansea, who have five goals between them. Dark horses.With the influential Lyon playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsán suffering a broken toe in their narrow 1-0 win against China it was easy to write off any chance of a serious title challenge. Yet the Group B winners have nine points, three clean sheets and five different goal scorers. They are no one-woman team. With the best run without a defeat of any team in the competition – 15 games – Martina Voss-Tecklenburg’s side have quietly flown under the radar.Possibly the most lopsided team in the tournament, the chaotic Australia defence is balanced by the goal machine, Sam Kerr, up top. Kerr already has five goals to draw her level with Morgan. How far Ante Milicic’s side can survive on a ‘you score two, we’ll score three’ mentality is anyone’s guess but, with Kerr firing on all cylinders, anything is possible.As mentioned, the Canadians had conceded only once in 2019 before they shipped two to the Netherlands to finish second in Group E. The talismanic forward Christine Sinclair is off the mark and on to 182 career goals – closing in on Abby Wambach’s record of 184 – but questions remain about the side’s fluidity going forward.In the shadow of USA Sweden quietly went about their own 2-0 and 5-1 defeats of Chile and Thailand. The Linköping striker, Kosovare Asllani, has two goals and, despite their loss to the Americans, they will cause other teams problems. Up first is Canada and the Netherlands have already shown their well-organised defence can be breached.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsA staggeringly bad run of nine defeats in the run-in to France was lifted with a Cristiane hat-trick against Jamaica. Buoyed by that win the Brazilians took a two-goal lead against Australia before a second-half capitulation. That sums up the team. Bright in attack but will leak goals against the best, or better than average.The injury to Caroline Graham Hansen will hurt the Norwegians but, if she regains fitness, they will test any team. France struggled to deal with Hansen as well as the Chelsea recruit, Guro Reiten.Handing an array of the country’s best young talent their World Cup debuts is a bold move and perhaps done with one eye on the future. The 2015 finalists have underwhelmed in France. The team’s technical, quick and possession-heavy football has been sorely let down by the final ball up front. They have scored only twice, both against Scotland. Luckily they face the Netherlands’ messy defence in the last-16. They have a chance to progress, but it’s a slim one.China are struggling to score. Li Ying has their only goal, in a 1-0 win against South Africa. They resiliently kept Germany at bay until Giulia Gwinn broke the dam but a decent work rate and defence cannot make up for the lack of firepower up top. With opponents Italy a fresh force internationally, pushing past the last 16 will be tough.An unknown quantity and they now play an England team that has not played African opposition since the 1995 World Cup, where they faced Nigeria. Their chaotic defence is matched by an equally chaotic, yet exhilarating, attack. Now Nchout Njoya Ajara is scoring, her two against New Zealand enough to send Cameroon through, and linking wonderfully with Gabrielle Onguene, the England defence should be worried.The Super Falcons’ 2-0 victory over a disappointing South Korea was enough to ensure a place in the last 16. Dealt a crushing blow when faced a retaken Wendie Renard penalty for France, which had hit the post, after the goalkeeper was adjudged to be off her line. Qualification feels like reward for a strong performance against the hosts, a game they lost only 1-0.If points were awarded for artistic merit, they would be much higher up this list. They dominate teams but just do not convert or create enough chances. Atlético Madrid’s Jennifer Hermoso benefited from two penalties against South Africa but Lucia Garcia has their only goal from open play, also in their group opener. Up next though, is the USA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fdb4e49820996f8795d4feced4cf8660159e4d5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d564ba411ccc6cff877eab3526b226ce","title":"past foreign country manchester united summer","story":"Another summer of rebuilding appears under way at Old Trafford but attempts to recreate the philosophies and glories of previous eras look doomed to failThere was an interesting programme on BBC Radio 4 this week about the notorious Portuguese man o’ war jellyfish. The man o’ war is of course the alpha of the jellyfish world, the big swinging tentacle of the deep ocean trench, not to mention the only jellyfish most people have heard of besides the ones that appear on English beaches in spring looking sad and dead and reproachful, surrounded by bottle tops and cigarette butts.Except it turns out the man o’ war isn’t a jellyfish at all. It is instead a kind of co-operative, a fusion of many small lifeforms into one large, successful stinging thing. The overall effect is a high-functioning mini-society of cells and organs and venomous pincers, the marine equivalent of a furiously angry rolling maul in a 1980s rugby union international, all eye-gouges and V-signs and furious Scottish oaths. In the programme the man o’ war was presented as a successful quirk of evolution, the survival of the collective as opposed to the inidual, sustained by that shared culture and purpose. And also as a metaphor for modern city life with its many erse, interlinked, self-sustaining parts.In fact the man o’ war works just as well as a metaphor for professional football clubs. Or at least for those clubs that like to mythologise themselves, to talk of an enduring club “culture”, some vital collective identity that must be honoured and nourished for the team to prosper – the Barcelona way, the Yeovil Town way. The parts may die and fall away. But the colony, the collective, the indispensable spirit endures.It is a way of understanding the past that has clung most notably to Manchester United, clouding not just issues of team-building and executive appointments, but the club’s basic sense of its own happiness. The latest summer of rebuild has continued to grind on this week, with something epic in its sense of stasis. This a club that always seems to be trying to get back to something, to find the door it came in through. There is a way of making things work, but it seems to be tied to finding the old patterns, swimming the same way, a culture that must be rebuilt to look the same.The presence of Ole Gunnar Solskjær as manager is the most obvious current symptom, the kind of appointment you might have expected from a seven-year-old with access to Google, but not necessarily the chief executive of one of the world’s largest football clubs. Darren Fletcher has since been talked up as a possible director of football. Rio Ferdinand is in the mix. Why not Chris Eagles, Lee Martin, Clive Tyldesley or drop-kicked Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons?Meanwhile Solskjær has stuck to the same narrow cultural view that got him the job in the first place, to the extent that he already looks like a kind of novelty appointment, a Britpop version of the real thing, sat in the back of his black cab, Paul Scholes up front tipping his bowler hat, talking with grating certainty about doing things The Manchester United Way, about Manchester United being different, playing up the echoes of Fergie time, the old, dead pointless glories.It is a delusion that continues to gum the works. This week there was further confusion over a social media video of Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford showing off their messy room on holiday. Imagine Bryan Robson’s reaction to that tangled bed linen. What would 1908 and 1911 title-winning manager Ernest Mangnall say about that bloke pretending to have sex with his pillow? The colony is unravelling. The present continues to betray the past.Whereas in reality this is all entirely misguided. The idea that some innate winning culture exists, some golden thread within these ever-changing commercial beasts is in itself a myth, and one that United are far from alone in following. Elite level football is shot through with the idea of cultures and “philosophies” and DNA. Frank Lampard’s possible return to Chelsea has led to much frowning speculation over whether the philosophy of Frank Lampard will fit with the philosophy of Chelseafootball club (it, you know, probably will).Look properly and there are few periods of success in any sport that haven’t involved junking much of what went before. The opposite is closer to the truth: chuck out the chintz, tear apart the colony. Matt Busby’s time at United was built on rejecting the brutal culture he’d found as a player and building something else. Alex Ferguson had to spend five years helping the whole place walk off a mind-bending hangover before he could go forward. Arsène Wenger didn’t recreate The Arsenal Way, he binned it completely.Still, it isn’t hard to see how this kind of myth-making gains a foothold. Supporters want to believe in the idea of a calling, a culture, something innately right and good. It is intoxicating. It mixes memory and desire. We all want to be told the past was great, that it will rise again, that it will taste just the same.Meanwhile for the owners of a club like United, intent on nothing else but sweating the asset, success is less important than the maintenance of a brand, retaining that core, deeply wedded support. Let’s face it, United would probably reappoint Ferguson if they could, just for the partner-buzz, the revenue uplift, the social media eyeballs.There is no sense of any hunger for a proper plan while the business thrums on. In the meantime the past will continue to cloud the future. The clubs leading the way will continue to become more effective machines. And Manchester United will continue to linger in its own timeline, clanking shut the doors on the DeLorean, cramming the furnace with coal, creaking out across the prairie once again in pursuit of the year 1985."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

According to a report from the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, they could face long-term problems from future heatwaves. But we can give them a helping hand.You don’t need to keep honeybees to help bees – in fact, a 2018 study commissioned by Cambridge University suggests that this can harm wild bees. It’s thought that the more bees there are in an area, the more competition there is for nectar and pollen if every shopping centre has three or four hives on the roof, what does that mean for the wild bees?It would be easy to assume that our built-up towns and cities are deserts for pollinators. Yet among the grey is also green: parks, gardens, balconies, doorsteps and window boxes, each with the potential to feed a city of bees. In fact, urban spaces can, in some instances, be better for bees and other pollinators than the countryside, where wildlife has largely been pushed out to make space for more crops and livestock. Gardens and parks are home to a greater variety of flowering plants than in the wild, and for a longer season, too. What’s more, we’re less likely to use pesticides in them, enabling bees and other pollinators to feed safely. Indeed, a study published last summer in the journal Proceedings Of The Royal Society B found that bumblebee colonies in urban areas were actually stronger than those in the wild. Most bees are solitary: in the British Isles there are about 267 species of bee of those, 220 species of wild bee are solitary. These nest inidually the male and female mate then the female finds somewhere to lay her eggs. She makes a series of cells, in which she lays an egg on a “cake” of pollen and nectar, and then, coming to the end of her life cycle, she dies, leaving her young to feed themselves on the stores she has left for them. Some nest in the ground, in lawns or sandy borders. Others nest in cavities, such as walls, old plant stems and holes in dead wood. Many survive in urban areas.Wild bees include 25 species of bumblebee, which, like the honeybee, live in a colony led by a queen: she largely stays in the nest while her workers forage for nectar and pollen to feed the grubs. Nests are annual, and you may be lucky enough to find one beneath a shed or hedge. The tree bumblebee nests in bird boxes.To help wild bees, you don’t need to buy loads of kit. You don’t even need a garden. The first thing to do is grow as many flowering plants as you can cram into your outdoor space. All bees need nectar and pollen, both to feed themselves and their young. Some emerge from hibernation as early as February, while others wait until September. Therefore, growing flowering plants from February to November is key. Grow crocus and primrose in spring, lavender in summer, and Verbena bonariensis and echinacea in autumn.The second thing to do is to create nesting habitats. If you have a garden, start a compost heap, or let an area of grass grow long, and leave twigs and leaf litter to accumulate at the back of your borders. Bumblebees might make a nest or even hibernate here. You could also erect a bee hotel – a box designed to mimic the cavities in which some solitary bees nest – in a garden, balcony or doorstep.If we make all our green spaces bee friendly, we will help tackle the extinction crisis head on.This distinctive bee (Anthidium manicatum) has black with yellow spots down each side of its abdomen. The female nests in bee hotels higher up than other species, so you may entice them in if you live in a high rise. The female lines her nests with hairs from furry leaves, such as lambs’ ear. Grow these and mullein to attract them. Flies June to August.Another cavity nester, this rusty orange bee (Osmia bicornis) lines its nest cells with mud. It’s thought to be about 125 times more efficient at pollinating apple blossom than the honey bee. Grow fruit trees and catmint to attract them. Flies April to early July.This large, black and yellow species (Bombus terrestris) with a buff or white tail nests underground in old mouse holes, beneath sheds. Nests are annual and founded by the queen, who might have about 150 workers in summer. Grow lavender, alliums and cornflowers to attract them. Flies March to November.Ginger, white and black, the tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum) specialises in nesting high up, and seems to have a preference for bird boxes. Grow daisy-type flowers, such as single dahlias or chamomile to attract them.

The scholars had flown in from across the world to spend a few days reviewing academic literature on the vexed subject of “populism”.One of the academics showed me a graph charting how the number of Google searches for “populism” had rocketed in 2016, around the time of the UK’s Brexit vote and the election of US president Donald Trump, and remained high ever since. For decades a niche topic mostly studied by specialists in Latin America, the study of populism was suddenly very much in vogue.I was in Spain on a fact-finding mission. ’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and her deputy, Paul Johnson, had given me the green light to run a series exploring the rise of populism. The meeting in Segovia was an opportunity to consult experts on the subject that I had been grappling with for some time.In my previous  roles – as Washington correspondent and San Francisco bureau chief – I had reported both on Trump’s extraordinary ascent to the White House and the similarly stunning success of Bernie Sanders, a once-fringe independent senator from Vermont who transformed Democratic politics.I had also spent months trying to understand how dominant technology platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube – and the wider “attention economy” that makes them hugely profitable – were rewiring politics and creating an uneven playing field that might be tilted toward populist candidates.Back in Europe, I recognised echoes of what I’d seen in America – populists on the left and right (although more so on the right) were gaining traction in countries as varied as Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Austria, Spain and Poland. Five of the world’s largest democracies were run by them, including India, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines.I learned two things from my trip to Spain. The first was that scholars who specialise in populism are exasperated at how frequently the term is overused or misapplied. The problem is especially acute in the UK, where commentators often use the term to refer to far-right, nativist politics, or use it as a shorthand for charismatic demagoguery.My second discovery was that while lots of useful research has been conducted on populism, it was limited – and there was surprisingly little in the way of empirical research tracking populist discourse, campaigns or parties.In the days that followed I worked with Mark Rice-Oxley, the ’s special projects editor, to sketch out the kinds of questions a series on populism would ask. What is populism, exactly, and where in the world is it taking root? Which parties and political leaders deserve the populist label, and what happens when they get into power? Perhaps most difficult of all: is rightwing populism, in particular, really on the rise, and, if so, why might that be?None of these questions have a simple or uncontested answer. This was always going to be an exploratory project helping us (and you, our readers) better understand populism, even if that meant there were no definitive conclusions. But we thought it was important to stay faithful to a broadly accepted definition of the p-word. Simply put, populism is a language that frames politics as a battle between the will of ordinary people and corrupt or self-serving elites, and can exist on the left or right.A few weeks later, we launched The New Populism, a series of essays and reported dispatches from locations as varied as Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, New Hampshire, Venice, Johannesburg, Delhi, Zurich, Glasgow and Hartlepool.The most novel parts of the series were the research projects we conducted in partnership with political scientists, including several I met in Segovia. We created a partnership with Team Populism, a global network of political scientists, to analyse the hundreds of speeches by presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of 40 countries across the world. A grant from the.org, a US-based non-profit group, enabled us to hire 46 researchers who were trained to identify populist discourse in speeches.The result was the Global Populism Database, the most up-to-date, comprehensive and reliable repository of populist discourse in the world – and the basis upon we which we were able to report that the number of populist leaders has more than doubled since the early 2000s.Team Populism also helped us build a data visualisation of how reliant Trump is on a teleprompter for his particular brand of rather inconsistent populism – and a hugely popular online quiz that allowed 1.5 million  readers to answer several questions to discover how populist their own views were.In another collaboration, we coordinated a team of 35 political scientists to peer-review a list of past and current populist parties in Europe. Our academic partners later helped us design and analyse a major global survey in partnership with YouGov, polling respondents in 23 countries to test populist sentiment across the world.The New Populism series finished last month, culminating in European parliamentary elections in which populist parties secured almost one in three votes. Nowhere was the success of populists more stark than in the UK, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party triumphed in last month’s election by capitalising on discontent over the failure to enact the result of the EU referendum.Brexit is only part of the story of a decline in trust in British elites that has long roots, as the sociologist Will Davies explained in one of a host of populism-themed essays we published in the Long Reads section.It used to be said that our first-past-the-post electoral system was a bulwark against insurgent populist parties. That may prove to be true. But the language of populism is everywhere in British politics these days. You hear it in the frequent vilification of political elites, the romanticisation of ordinary or “real” people, the attacks on the media and the idea that politics is no longer just a battle of ideas but a winner-takes-all conflict between good and evil.It can pop up in sometimes unexpected places – from Theresa May’s speeches, to the lexicon of those arch-Remainers who insist a “people’s vote” is the only legitimate response to a Brexit stitch-up contrived by powerful cabal of crooks and liars. Our six-month focus on populism has come to an end. But it seems inevitable that populism will be a subject we continue to report on for months and years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1669c0e61aa0f2396a318bcb5d85874191a6986/0_193_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea77229ec4bd2d252ca0fe1e3b1b7c0","title":"the whole thing was dismal readers on the tory tv debate","story":"Candidates for the Conservative leadership took part in a debate on Tuesday – readers have been reacting in the commentsMost of us will have worked with or for a leader who has had the ability to inspire, to motivate, to explain, to prioritise, to delegate, to coach, to be authentic, to involve, to be intellectually agile, to set out a compelling vision and to make following herhim an honour. None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

Right now it’s very easy for men to say ‘it’s not really on me’,” said Owers, a PhD student. “If the gel becomes widely available, it’s much more stark that by not taking that option, you actively made the decision to not take responsibility.”“I think it’s a massive deal,” said Bardsley, a social researcher. “It gives the chance for men to have this great combination of autonomy and more responsibility as well. That can only have a positive impact on the relationship between men and women in society.”The gel, which is applied daily to the chest, shoulders and upper arms, contains a mixture of progesterone and testosterone. The progesterone switches off sperm production in the testes and the testosterone offsets a drop in testosterone that this causes.Without adding testosterone back in, men get unpleasant side-effects such as low mood, weight gain and a slump in libido. Because testosterone is metabolised so quickly in the liver, it can’t be delivered effectively via a pill, and this has proved the major obstacle to developing a male hormonal contraceptive.Recently, though, there has been significant progress. A trial in 2016 of a hormone jab demonstrated effectiveness rates close to those of the female pill, although some participants encountered other problems including acne and depression. Scientists hope the gel version, which is being tested at centres in the UK, Sweden, Chile and Kenya, will prove easier to use and have fewer negative side-effects.The drug comes in a pump something like a toothpaste dispenser and has the consistency of hand sanitiser. The man applies one dose to each shoulder, upper arm and pec each morning.A slight inconvenience is that the female partner has to avoid contact with this part of the body (“unless Diana wants to grow a beard,” Owers said) to prevent a second-hand dose of testosterone. So men are advised to either shower before bed or wear a T-shirt at night.After using it for six weeks, Owers learned that his sperm count had dropped to almost zero. He said he felt “quite excited” rather than anxious on getting the result from the trial’s head nurse.It would take a similar length of time for sperm production to ramp back up to normal, meaning a missed dose for a few days would not result in a significant chance of pregnancy, unlike with the female pill.After nine weeks on the gel, the side-effects have been minimal: some small spots on the lower back, a slightly increased sex drive and putting on about 2kg have been the only notable changes. “The overarching thing is that I feel it’s had very little impact on my life,” he said.If results of the year-long trial are encouraging, the scientific team hope there will be interest from pharmaceutical companies to take the product to market, and this could happen within four to five years.“Before the pill came into existence we couldn’t have predicted the effects it would have in society,” said John Reynolds-Wright, a clinical research fellow at Edinburgh who is leading the trial. “In the same way, I don’t think we can really accurately predict the effect this will have. But like the pill, I think it will be largely for the positive.”• The trial is recruiting men aged between 18 and 50 who are in a stable relationship with a woman aged between 18 and 34.

But the England captain remains optimistic that, as occurred following the defeat by Pakistan at Trent Bridge in the second game of the tournament, a response from his players will be forthcoming.Morgan said: “You look at the basics of a run chase. Partnerships are very important and we struggled to get enough going. We had a couple of inidual innings but that’s not good enough to win a game.“When we get beaten, we tend to come back quite strong – we tend to resort to aggressive, smart, positive cricket. It is now about fronting up for the next game.“We need to learn as much as we can from this match and bounce back well against Australia. We do not see this as a blow to our semi-final chances at all.”Despite that assertion, England’s fourth consecutive defeat by Sri Lanka in a World Cup has made their passage to the semi-finals trickier.After Australia come Virat Kohli’s India – the two teams meet at Edgbaston, where away supporters are once again expected to outnumber their own – before facing an impressive New Zealand side at Chester-le-Street.All three matches will throw up fresh challenges but perhaps none like the low-slung arm of Lasith Malinga. Despite having faced the 35-year-old in 29 previous ODIs (and seven Twenty20 internationals), England continue to struggle with his angle.Jos Buttler, one of four victims of Malinga after being trapped lbw for 10, said: “He is just different. The stumps are always in play – if it hits you in line it’s generally close.“We didn’t counter him as well as we could but credit to a fantastic bowler.” On the performance overall England’s vice-captain added: “I think we lacked energy with the bat. That doesn’t just mean hitting fours and sixes. That means showing intensity and trying to put pressure back on the bowlers.“I think we were a little bit passive as a group, which is what we haven’t been for a long time. That is the most frustrating thing.”It was the second match that England have been without Jason Roy and his understudy, James Vince, once again frustrated with a couple of eye-catching boundaries that were followed by a thick edge to slip off Malinga on 14.Roy, who tore a hamstring against West Indies, remains optimistic about a return at Lord’s – he performed 12th man duties here – but is still due for a second scan on the injury this weekend to assess its progress.Buttler said: “As a group we didn’t have that intensity. Obviously Jason is a guy who naturally does that but we can all do that from one to 11. We have played in a certain way for a long period of time and we went away from that today.”Asked if Roy’s absence has put England out of kilter, Morgan replied: “I don’t think it has at all.“Obviously we would love him in the side. He’s a huge strength at the top of the order. But that’s not why we lost the game or why we might have struggled on this wicket.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c99bebc5f63e473fce936bfbff280bd3325094a9/0_363_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45acfe4d2c20c0a0f0a4da351898a597","title":"ireland junior jockeys in pictures","story":"A late summer day’s racing across the sands of Béal Bán can haunt your winter with happy dreams. Around the end of August each year, the fledgling jockeys of the horse and pony circuit descend on this fabled white strand outside the village of Ballyferriter in West Kerry. They ride horses that tend to be either young and excitable or old and stubborn. They show the vivacious colours of their racing silks against skies that sit as often as not greyly over the mountains of the Dingle peninsula and the cold waters of Smerwick Harbour. This is horse racing in a pure, amateur form, and at a meeting like this you can’t help feeling it belongs to an older and better world than ours.The young jockeys have about them an air of intensity and a sense of lasered focus that lifts them directly out of childhood and adolescence – you recognise at once that these are serious operators, and this is a serious game.“I’m 10 years of age now,” says Dylan O’Connor from Liscarroll in County Cork, “but I started off with the horses when I was about two and a half.”He rode in just the one race at Ballyferriter last summer, but it went well enough. “I came in second, I was about two lengths back,” he says. “The horse was a fairly old fella, so he was grand, you know? You wouldn’t be nervous getting up on him at all.”Whenever he gets the chance, and whatever the season, Dylan is away with the horses. “I’d always get out on a Saturday, but hopefully I’d be out in the week as well,” he says. “And at home I’d be watching it on the television a fair bit. I’d be looking out for jockeys like Jack Kennedy or Ruby.”In Ireland, the jockey Ruby Walsh tends to pass as a one-name entity he is a key figure in the pantheon of native heroes for the young riders. And you have to start young – in truth, you’d want to be of veteran stock before secondary school to be seen as a real proposition. If you go well at the likes of Ballyferriter, the entire world of racing might open up to you. “You have to be 16 for the track racing,” Dylan says. “It’s definitely something I’d be thinking about.”At 14, Daniel King, from Kilbrin in County Cork, is nearer still to the age when professional racing might become a reality. “I’m on racehorses since I was 11,” he says, “and I’m doing the point-to-points now as well. I started racing ponies when I was about nine, I suppose.” This wasn’t his first appearance at Ballyferriter – he is already a seasoned familiar of the strand, and the 2018 meeting went markedly well for him. “I think I had seven winners... I know that I won the first five races. But the horses I had were good enough now, to be honest, and I’d have expected to go well.”He knows exactly the discipline that’s required should the professional game become a reality (“My weight’s all right at this stage, anyway!”) but the attraction of racing overrides all else. “Ah, it’s a very exciting thing, yeah. Definitely you’d miss it if you’re away from it for any length of time.”Racing horses is a kind of glorious infection, and once you’ve got the bug, there is no reliable cure. Alan Powdrill, the photographer who took these portraits, stumbled upon the Ballyferriter scene while on a road trip down Ireland’s Atlantic coast last summer. “I saw a poster for the races in a bar and thought I’d go out and take a look. And I knew straight away it was gold. I hadn’t realised it was going to be all these young kids racing.” The fact of a typically overcast day in West Kerry was ideal. “I knew if I used a flash, I could really make the colours pop.”The meeting at Ballyferriter is one of many organised by the Horse and Pony Racing Association (Southern Section). There are meetings at Ballingarry in County Limerick, another beach meeting at Ballyheigue in Kerry, another at Allihies way out at the tip of the Beara peninsula in West Cork, and many others. They are held on fields and stretches of sand that have very often been the sites of horse races for hundreds of years. Many of the famous Irish jockeys have come through from the ranks of the HPRA meets – Norman Williamson, Wayne Lordan, Kate O’Brien. If you can keep manners on a jerky two-year-old across the sands of Béal Bán, nothing that Aintree or Cheltenham can throw up should faze you.I’ve been around racing people a bit over the last few years, researching a film script. I have found among them no more than a grudging acknowledgment that there is such a thing as life beyond the racing of horses, but how dull and inert it must be, and why would you even bother? This is very much a tribe, and there are particular tribal instincts. Even with jockeys as young as these, there is a lovely kind of reticence, or modesty. There is no big talk. The victories are worn lightly the defeats are all the more frequent and are suffered without complaint. It is a sport with a tacit magic made of the trust that develops between jockey and horse, the silent agreement that they can only get through this thing together.On days like this at Ballyferriter, the peninsula might seem to be en fête – the chip vans are out, and the bouncy castles – but when it gets down to the hard business of racing, the attention is intense and deeply serious, and nothing, but nothing quickens the blood like the roaring thunder of a galloping pack across the compacted sands. This is inarguably the kingly sport, even still, and there isn’t a corner of the earth where it is more important to the texture of life neither is there a place where the riders are more revered.• Kevin Barry’s new novel Night Boat To Tangier is out this week.

Princely. Two more wickets and they’re down to that long tail. It all hinges on Dhoni. The big one! Nabi keeps plugging away and Kohli top-edges a cut to backward point, where Rahmat takes a fine catch, ing forward. Game on.30th over: India 133-3 (Kohli 66, Dhoni 3) Back comes Rahmat, who was just changing ends. Dhoni is stroking it into the covers, just like Kohli, except that Dhoni’s shots are going to the only man saving the single. India still not racing away with this: maybe that score predictor was right. My question about Abhijato (24th over) has elicited a reply. “Ah, I am!” he exclaims, suddenly turning into a character from Jane Austen. “OB Jato is my pen-name, which helps people get around the frankly complicated pronunciation of my formal name in everyday life... It’s also easier to remember for people who follow my writing andor musical endeavours on the Internet :)” Of course.29th over: India 128-3 (Kohli 62, Dhoni 2) Rahmat is taken off, unexpectedly, as Nabi returns and keeps it tight. The Afghanis are managing to keep Kohli off strike, which may be as close as they can get to frustrating him.A good spot from Romeo. “That’s Rahmat’s 14th wicket in 67 ODIs.” 28th over: India 125-3 (Kohli 60, Dhoni 1) Rashid rushes through his over as Dhoni makes his usual scratchy start. Rashid has 5-0-26-0, which must be sheer bliss after the battering he took the other day.27th over: India 124-3 (Kohli 59, Dhoni 1) So success for Rahmat, who straightened that one just enough. And here comes Old Man Dhoni, who could easily be putting his feet up now that India have two spare wicketkeepers on board. Gulbadin gives him a slip. Steve Waugh would have a slip, a gully, a short leg and a silly point.Aleem Dar called it right – hitting leg stump. It’s not the big one, but it’s well worth having.26th over: India 122-2 (Kohli 58, Shankar 28) Just when the game is threatening to go to sleep, Kohli spots a long hop from Rashid and plays a pull with so much whip that you could serve it on a cone and charge £2.50 for it.25th over: India 115-2 (Kohli 53, Shankar 27) Shankar chips Rahmat over extra cover, inside-out, for his best shot of the day, and that’s another fifty partnership off 63 balls. A moment earlier, the score predictor was giving India 298. I’d say 330, for what it’s worth: eight or nine an over for the second half of the innings. Come on Gulbadin, conjure up a wicket.24th over: India 109-2 (Kohli 52, Shankar 22) Rashid continues, which means both batsmen can wear caps. A decent over ends with a googly that squeezes into Kohli’s pads.“Death, taxes and a Virat Kohli masterclass,” says OB Jato, “the three things that are certain in life.” Is he by any chance related to our friend Abhijato?23rd over: India 105-2 (Kohli 51, Shankar 19) Gulbadin takes himself off and turns to Rahmat Shah, so it’s leg-spin from both ends. He does have a slip, which is surely right, but Shankar seizes on a half-volley and gets four on the strength of a misfield in the deep.Where’s Brian Withington when you need him? Right here. “As good hosts,” he writes, “England have done much to help the round-robin stage of this tournament by losing twice already, thereby somewhat alleviating the risk of the dreaded ‘dead rubber’ syndrome. Is it too much to ask that India, as the dominant force in world cricket, show similar consideration today and perhaps when they play England, too? Just asking.”22nd over: India 98-2 (Kohli 50, Shankar 13) Kohli, facing Rashid, cruises to fifty off 49 balls, with only four fours but several hard-run twos. It’s the 93rd time he has reached fifty in a one-day international, and the third in succession. What a champion he is.21st over: India 91-2 (Kohli 47, Shankar 10) The singles keep coming off Nabi. Gulbadin needs to make something happen.20th over: India 86-2 (Kohli 44, Shankar 8) Gulbadin takes himself off and brings on Rashid Khan. He’s brave enough to toss his first ball up to Kohli, who is ruthless enough to cover-drive for four. Kick a man when he’s down, why don’t you? Rashid actually bowls a good first over, but his desperation shows in a very poor review.It was a good ball, but there was a big fat inside edge.It’s Rashid Khan, with his googly...19th over: India 79-2 (Kohli 38, Shankar 7) Nabi continues, with not a single close fielder, when Afghanistan’s best hope has to be to keep on taking wickets. If it was stopping the runs, it might make sense, but the singles are flowing.18th over: India 75-2 (Kohli 36, Shankar 5) Gulbadin tries a slower-ball bouncer against Kohli, who pulls and misses. Between them the bowlers have managed to push him into the middle lane. And that’s drinks, with Afghanistan narrowly on top, but India still threatening to go big. In other cricket news, England’s women are playing West Indies. Here’s Raf Nicholson’s report.17th over: India 73-2 (Kohli 35, Shankar 4) An over from Nabi that’s so frugal, it could have been Mujeeb himself. And here’s John Starbuck, picking up on Abhijato’s point (13th over). “There used to be a case whereby a batsman could object to a substitute fielder in a ‘specialist’ position. Does this still happen? If so, how far does ‘specialist’ extend?” I don’t think it does, but I’m waiting to be corrected, probably by Romeo.16th over: India 71-2 (Kohli 34, Shankar 3) More singles off Gulbadin, who will be quite happy to see Shankar nicking the strike off the last ball.15th over: India 66-2 (Kohli 32, Shankar 1) Well done Nabi, who has 2-0-6-1. He and Mujeeb, the two offies, have 2-24 between them, while the seamers have 0-44. In a perfect world, Rishabh Pant would now be striding out to join Kohli. In the real world, it’s Vijay Shankar, who came in against Pakistan to replace the injured Dhawan, and ended up replacing the injured Kumar. Well, it’s not the one they wanted, but it’ll do. Rahul suddenly pulls out the reverse sweep and gives the easiest of catches to backward point.14th over: India 64-1 (Rahul 30, Kohli 30) Gulbadin gets milked again, but doesn’t go for any fours.13th over: India 59-1 (Rahul 26, Kohli 30) Mujeeb is taken off – well, he did concede a four – and replaced by another off-spinner, Nabi. He goes for three singles, and a wide, as the fifty partnership comes up off 51 balls.If your inbox is ever feeling empty, there’s one person you can count on: Abhijato Sensarma. “If a player is injured,” he muses, “he does not come out to bat and his team sends out just ten men it shouldn’t be too crazy, then, to suggest that the same team must field with ten fielders as well when the time comes! One possible counterargument to this is that bowling and batting are primary tasks, both of which become impossible to perform on injury, while fielding is a secondary element of the game, but the point persists. This year’s IPL as well as the ongoing World Cup has seen many substitute fielders do better than the ones they’ve replaced, giving the teams what could be perceived as an unfair advantage. Your thoughts on the matter?” A word to the wise, Abhijato: choose your battles. 12th over: India 55-1 (Rahul 24, Kohli 29) Gulbadin gives up on slips altogether, which is modest (as he himself is the bowler) but surely too deferential. Kohli is finding it all too easy, motoring along at three runs every two balls, while Rahul and Sharma together have gone at one every two. So Afghanistan simply have to get Kohli out.11th over: India 49-1 (Rahul 22, Kohli 26) Mujeeb finally concedes a four, off his 36th ball, as he dishes up a full toss onto Kohli’s pads and the gift is gratefully accepted. Kohli has 26 off only 16 balls: anything Eoin can do... 10th over: India 41-1 (Rahul 20, Kohli 20) Does Kohli ever run out of motivation? He’s right in the mood now, getting way forward to cover-drive Gulbadin’s first ball for three. He has caught up with Rahul already, after facing just 12 balls, to Rahul’s 38. The powerplay ends with Afghanistan entitled to feel very pleased with themselves, while just ruing that fateful field change.9th over: India 36-1 (Rahul 19, Kohli 16) Same old story: another over from Mujeeb goes for two singles.8th over: India 34-1 (Rahul 18, Kohli 15) Gulbadin is giving the batsmen singles to midwicket, perhaps in an attempt to get them LBW. Kohli just sees the gap and thinks “I’ll have two there”. Then he flicks Aftab for four and back-foot-drives him for four more. We have two completely different ballgames going on at the same time.7th over: India 20-1 (Rahul 17, Kohli 2) Mujeeb is still asking questions and commanding respect. He has figures of 4-0-8-1, which would be superb in any ODI, let alone a World Cup game against India.6th over: India 18-1 (Rahul 16, Kohli 1) India, the grandest of all the cricket nations these days, reassert themselves as Rahul forces Aftab for four. Gulbadin blinks and tinkers with the field, moving first slip out, keeping second – and a regulation edge goes straight through the gap. Oh dear.5th over: India 9-1 (Rahul 7, Kohli 1) So Afghanistan’s bowlers, far from being cowed by the battering they took from England, have bounced back and made a textbook start. Now they just need five more wickets to get down to India’s long tail. Beauty! Sharma, who never got going, is utterly bamboozled by Mujeeb’s carrom ball, which pitches on off stump, grips,d turns and takes out the off bail.4th over: India 7-0 (Rahul 6, Sharma 1) Aftab isn’t quick, around 82mph, but he’s busy and bustling and gets some lift. He keeps KL Rahul quiet and gets a maiden. 3rd over: India 7-0 (Rahul 6, Sharma 1) An even thriftier over and another moral victory for Mujeeb as Rahul plays a curious shot, a mistimed top-spin forehand that goes close to the man at short midwicket.2nd over: India 6-0 (Rahul 5, Sharma 1) It’s seam at the other end in the shape of Aftab Alam. He’s wearing a headband, half red and half green, like a boy in the back yard saying “I’m McEnroe. And Viv Richards.” Three off the over again, with Rahul pushing into the covers for a couple.1st over: India 3-0 (Rahul 2, Sharma 1) The new ball is taken by Mujeeb, the teenaged off-spinner who was Afghanistan’s best bowler against England. He makes a tidy start, conceding three singles and drawing a leading edge from Rohit Sharma. The pitch looks slow.Just the one change for India, and that’s enforced, as Mohammad Shami comes in for the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar. So there’s no Pant, unfortunately for the crowd, and India have a long tail. The Afghan bowlers’ job is to get down to it.Gulbadin makes two changes, bringing back Hazratullah at the top of the order and Aftab at the bottom. Dawlat, the man who dropped Eoin Morgan on 28, pays the price, as if he hadn’t already. But it’ll be good to see Hazratullah, who is 21 (thanks for the correction, Romeo) and already on his second career. His first was as a security man, aged 15, working nights. He had internet access and used the time to study his favourite players.Kohli wins the toss and chooses to bat. Gulbadin, still smiling, says he would have done the same.Morning everyone and welcome to what may well be the perfect mismatch. It’s the strongest team in the World Cup so far against the weakest. But the last time India met Afghanistan, in Dubai last September, the result was… a tie. On behalf of the neutrals, I’m putting in a request for another one of those.A cup isn’t a proper cup without a few upsets. England have done their best as hosts to make the party go with a swing, by stumbling to defeat against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But those two games are the only ones in which a team from the top four has lost to one of the other six. Today, for the sake of the tournament, West Indies need to beat New Zealand, who have a 100pc record when they get onto the field. The same is true of India, but the chances of Afghanistan springing a shock do look a bit remote.For Virat Kohli, who missed the tie in Dubai, the question is whether to rest any of his big guns and give a World Cup debut to Rishabh Pant. Rest is hardly needed as India have only played three games so far, but England showed yesterday that it’s unwise to keep letting the same batsmen do all the work, because then, when you’re in a tight corner, the spare parts are liable to be rusty and brittle. Pant is a thrilling stroke-player who surely should have been in India’s squad in the first place. He has it in him to be this team’s Geoff Hurst.For Afghanistan, it’s all about getting over their most recent experience, watching in disbelief as Eoin Morgan scored a century in sixes. “You’re only as good as your last match,” people are apt to say – and it’s nonsense. A firework display is often followed by a fizzle, and vice-versa. Morgan went from hero to zero yesterday Rashid Khan, his main victim on Tuesday, left nursing a bruised ego and figures of 9-0-110-0, is easily good enough to make the same journey in the opposite direction.The match is at Southampton, which tends to be a sporting surface with plenty of runs in it. Play starts at 10.30am BST, in about 35 minutes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af892d4e4d716924d0d3be546fb9828d714b5eff/0_182_5269_3162/master/5269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=304e108fa18b67eaa429ca352bea6c73","title":"royal ascot 2019 day five live","story":"1st CarriageTHE QUEENThe Duke of YorkThe Hon.

This repetition of imagery, all backed by bright green turf, brings into play Andy Warhol’s late screenprints of Elizabeth II from his ‘Reigning Queens’ series (1985), a quartet of the postage stamp icon in camp conjugations of Hollywood make-up and bubblegum colours.’The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from royal duties and apparently hated his trips down the road from Windsor Castle to the races, is missing but little else has changed including the blather. This is last year’s Royal Procession on the Saturday – see if you can spot the difference.This is a great little feature with some terrific pics on Ireland’s junior jockeys in the Observer tomorrow. Take a look ...As revealed yesterday, Ladbrokes have given up on this having been stung this week. William Hill are still joining in and report good money for yellow, from 5-1 in to 3’s, Rupert Adams stating: “We know the Queen is a favourite of yellow and we think she will roll it out for the final day of the Royal meeting.”“This year’s hat stakes have taken an interesting turn as bookies, again, suspended betting this morning, said a spokesperson for W2.bet. “Pink was a very popular pick yesterday and got punters back on track after some interesting turns this week. But in the end, so far, the hat stakes have been won by punters. Today’s favourite is yellow, followed by whitecream and then purple.”Many thanks to all who took part in our tipping competitions this week! Our winners will be contacted by email by Monday. They were:Tuesday: fallguy99Wednesday: melonkThursday: JimmyDeuceFriday: mycopia23We’re not running a tipping competition today, as we’ve found in the past that Saturday attracts fewer players. But do please share your selections and fancies below. If enough people get involved, we’ll review this for next year.You want to know what’s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the final day at Royal Ascot. Stay here and we’ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on.But never mind those, let’s talk about the five winners on Friday ... If I could live a day’s racing over and over, it would be that one. And I have no regrets about the Sandringham, which I always find difficult there is just no way I could have picked Thanks Be. So I dare say today will be a 06 and bump back to Earth, but I still like the look of a few of these, especially So Perfect, who seems strong in the betting. Spring Loaded’s price has collapsed, at last in part because the influential Hugh Taylor has also put him up. Younevercall seems popular. I’m surprised The Tin Man is so big, having so much good course form to his name.Mark your card. These are not turning up, for the various reasons outlined.The going for the fifth day of Royal Ascot 2019 has changed to Good, Good to Firm in places (from Good on the straight course and Good, Good to Soft in places on the round course at the end of Friday)It has been dry since racing on Wednesday when there was 10 millimetres of rain. A dry and sunny day is forecast, with temperatures up to 22 degrees Celsius.Chris Stickels, clerk of the course at Ascot, said at 9.00am: “It is a lovely, bright, dry and sunny morning. We have now been dry since Wednesday and the track is drying out really nicely.” GoingStick Readings at 8.15am today: Stand side: 8.2, Centre: 8.4, Far Side: 8.1.

It’s the people’s day, insofar as any day at this venue can ever carry such a label, when more folk are able to attend and a crowd of around 70,000 packs out the stand. More than any other day this week, the train takes the strain, as an estimated 30,000 normally travel here by the Waterloo-Reading line on the Saturday of the Royal meeting, so we will find out how much disruption is caused by the continuing industrial action by rail staff. The Queen’s track is bathed in warm sunshine and we finally have the sort of weather you’d like to expect in mid-June. The famously free-drying track is described as good to firm in places and GoingStick readings also suggest that any horses in need of soft are basically sunk. This is a day to be backing zippy types with quick actions who float across the turf, raising memories of Danehill, Habibti and other great sprinters with their names on the trophies here.Speaking of greats, Frankie Dettori is back, trying to find the one extra winner he needs to make this his best Royal Ascot ever at the age of 48. I’m afraid he is one down already, as Lah Ti Dar, his intended mount in the Hardwicke, has been withdrawn after failing to eat up. I’ve already heard one punter talking of combining the Italian’s mounts in multiple bets - but first he must find a bookie still prepared to take such bets.Hayley Turner is not here, alas. Yesterday, she became only the second female jockey to ride a winner at Royal Ascot but today her business takes her to Newmarket and Lingfield. The only woman riding here is Megan Nicholls, booked by her father for Black Corton in the very last race. Black Corton is not without his chance in the Queen Alexandra, his very first Flat race, and it will be remembered that he has done several good turns for another female jockey, Bryony Frost, who won her first Grade One on him two Christmases ago.But the meat of the afternoon is the two sprints, the classy Diamond Jubilee at 4.20pm and the unsolveable Wokingham at 5pm. They are Royal Ascot in miniature, over before you know it after a tonne of preparation. But the memories will be sweet if you can pinpoint either winner. Be lucky!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99b7a415b3618a79cdcd3f60d04b876e3dfa8c0a/0_0_1165_699/master/1165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a430f02c76077b8fcea9099f30d38b36","title":"instagram influencer staged surprise engagement weekend","story":"Marissa Fuchs posted photos of disbelief, but marketers were sent itinerary months beforeA public proposal is a risky thing to attempt. For every couple whose love for each other is perfectly in tune, there is a partner who has woefully misjudged their lover’s desire for public attention, grand romantic gestures, or simply marriage full stop.So Gabriel Grossman might have been taking a huge risk when he and his girlfriend, the Instagram influencer Marissa Casey Fuchs, embarked on not just a public proposal, but a 48-hour-long surprise holiday scavenger hunt, exhaustively documented by the couple on their respective Instagram accounts. What if she’d said no? Or decided that this precious moment was too personal to be shared with her audience of 193,000 people?But perhaps Grossman didn’t need to worry. Not just because Fuchs has been sharing nearly every detail of her life for years and shows no sign of stopping – but also because it may not have been as much of a surprise as her audience were led to believe.Before the “surprise” trip even began, marketers across New York had received a detailed itinerary of what it would contain. Spread over multiple pages, the PDF slide-deck detailed where Grossman and Fuchs would be, down to the hour, as well as what and how Fuchs would share on her Instagram account, from a “specialty shot” at the Surf Lodge at 9pm on Tuesday to a “Short Film Next Stop Post” at Gurney’s Resort at 8am the next morning.The document promised to “capture heartwarming moments and surprise and delight the soon-to-be bride at every twist turn and flight!” It ended with an offer to brands of “the opportunity to align with this momentous occasion and the beautiful cities she will be visiting along the way”.The slide deck was leaked to the Atlantic’s Taylor Lorenz, the Bob Woodward of the influencer world, who published it on Thursday. “The pdf not only is expertly designed, but also directly solicits brand partnerships and was sent to marketers under the guise of a possible sponsorship,” Lorenz wrote, dismissing initial claims from a friend of Fuchs that the document was a simple “logistical plan”.Not that such a pitch would be likely to be particularly successful, says Arron Shepherd, co-founder of influencer marketing agency Goat. “I would find it very strange. It’s not something that’s coming along regularly. People will certainly tell us, “I’m going to be here at this time” and seek sponsorship, but something so personal as that … It’ll be giving birth next.”Indeed, Shepherd worries that the pitch could end up doing more harm than good for Fuchs’ burgeoning celebrity. “The people that will suffer the most will be the influencers, not the brands. Influencers have very specific audiences, who are sensitive to betrayal.”What influencers are selling, says Tom Winbow, UK MD of Ralph Creative, is authenticity, and when that is harmed, it can damage their business. “The strength of an influencer’s influence is really defined by the relationship with their audience. We find that those influencers who remain authentic and cultivate a real relationship with their audience are the ones who can genuinely influence their audience in to taking an actual action (and not just an empty like or comment).“Social media was supposed to be all about authenticity and real moments, without the gloss of traditional media. Across all media, traditional and social, the trusted bond between author and audience is becoming more and more fractured. And stories like these only serve to damage this relationship further, meaning we should always ask ourselves, ‘What is real?’”When the mask slips too much, the results can be actively unpleasant. Last year, fashion blogger Scarlett Dixon posted an Instagram shot of herself supposedly having breakfast. The picture, a sponsored post for a brand of mouthwash, was ludicrously over the top in its twee perfection, with Dixon, who Instagrams as @scarlettlondon, sitting on a freshly made bed, surrounded by pancakes and strawberries with an apparently empty cup of tea and pink heart-shaped balloons floating above her head.As the image spread across other social networks, Dixon faced a torrent of abuse. “Each time I refresh my page, hundreds of new nasty messages pour on to my Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, some of which have contained malicious death threats,” she wrote in a follow-up Instagram post. “There are now hundreds of thousands of tweets circling the internet, shaming me.”“My feed isn’t a place of reality,” Dixon added. “I mean, who spends their time in such a beautiful city, perched on a ledge, ice-cream in hand and smile permanently affixed to her face? It’s staged, guys.”For the FuchsGrossman household, at least, the preparation didn’t seem to pay off. He told Lorenz that “most brands didn’t even respond”, with the bulk of the sponsorship coming from companies the pair already had dealings with. “I can be public for a bit for this one moment in our lives, then it will go back to normal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a791ae81beee4fb57f028341c8d4e9494b86d0db/709_683_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1666fdc81d25cdc3bf15829939c4408b","title":"send us a tip on enjoying lakes in the uk and europe for a chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Lakes can be quiet beauty spots, a hive of fun activities or great places for hiking, swimming and sailing.

The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) launched the Take Your Tent Home – Say No To Single Use campaign earlier this year, which followed the Drastic on Plastic initiative in 2018. As with other campaigns, such as Eco Action’s Love Your Tent and its #justtakeithome message, the aim is to reduce waste and remind festivalgoers that a tent is for life, not just for a weekend.A cheaper and greener alternative to buying a tent is to borrow one. Peer-to-peer lending sites, such as Fat Llama, include listings for a variety of camping equipment – currently there are four-person tents from £2 a day. Alternatively, give a new home to a discounted display or refurbished tent from Vango’s Camping Recycled site.Down-filled products have long been rejected by ethically minded consumers. Although there are responsible down standards among some outdoor clothing and equipment brands, these vary between manufacturers, and there are still concerns about cruelty taking place. It is often difficult to tell whether down has come from a live-plucked bird or one force-fed for foie gras.Natural rubber seems like an obvious alternative to PVC or plastic-based wellington boots. Rubber wellies are more durable and when they are eventually discarded, they won’t be toxic when they decompose. However, it’s best to find out whether the material comes from sustainable sources or not before buying.This sparkly stuff may seem joyful and innocent but most of it contains microplastics that will eventually end up in waterways and oceans. Along with banning single-use plastics, such as straws, many festivals are now asking onsite stalls to only sell biodegradable glitter. In March this year, campaign group 38 Degrees launched a petition calling for the ban of conventional plastic glitter in the UK, and several retailers, including Aldi and Waitrose, have committed to scrapping it from products by 2020.There are several companies selling biodegradable glitter, in a range of colours, blends and particle sizes. These are all made using Bioglitter, created from plant cellulose, sourced mainly from sustainably-farmed eucalyptus trees. Eco Glitter Fun (from £4 for single tins of loose glitter and £22 for a set of six) and EcoStardust (from £6 a bag)also use recyclable packaging and support environmental projects through donations. The latter also sells an all-natural vegan balm (£6) to use as a base for the glitter.

Proffered agreement. All pre planned. Anything else I would take to SC,” he added, apparently alluding to Trump potentially challenging Mueller at the US supreme court.Hannity is known to speak frequently with Trump by telephone. In August 2017, Hannity warned Manafort that any supporter of Trump would be “road kill” in the investigations into his circle.“I hope Potus understands your point,” Manafort replied, using the common abbreviation for “President of the United States”. In response, Hannity said: “I tell him a lot. A real lot. Brutally honest relationship.”The text messages were filed to court under seal as an exhibit by Mueller’s team during Manafort’s prosecution in Washington DC for financial crimes. It was not immediately clear what the messages were used to demonstrate.Manafort pleaded guilty to charges in Washington DC after having been convicted on eight charges in a separate trial in Virginia last year. He received a combined sentence of about seven and a half years in prison for his convictions.The former campaign chairman complained repeatedly to Hannity about the conduct of Mueller’s senior attorneys, claiming they were pressuring him to lie about wrongdoing by Trump and Kushner in return for favorable treatment.“They would want me to give up DT or family, esp JK. I would never do that,” he wrote when asked why he had not been given a “sweetheart deal” like another defendant in his case. But there were no crimes to report, Manafort claimed. “They will want me to make shit up on both. I will never do that,” he said.Other text messages released on Friday showed Hannity alluding to further conversations with Trump. On 3 February last year, he wrote to Manafort: “I’m disgusted at this corruption. It should not happen in the USA. I can tell u Potus is disgusted too.”Hannity also appeared to claim he had inside information on developments at high levels of the administration. At one point he purported to know the release date of an investigation report. And in November 2017, Manafort told Hannity he hoped Jeff Sessions, then the US attorney general, would appoint a “new spec pros”.Conservative activists have demanded a second special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, Trump’s defeated 2016 opponent, andor the origins of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign.In response, Hannity appeared to say Sessions would have to do so or “he is gone”, though an apparent typographical error replaced “or” with “it”. Hannity explained he had “talked to a friend”. Manafort replied: “Fingers crossed you are right.”In March last year, Hannity said in a message to Manafort that Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, was to withdraw his guilty plea to a charge of lying to the FBI. Flynn did not do so but recently replaced his attorneys, sparking speculation that he may yet.Asked to confirm the texts were Hannity’s, a Fox News spokeswoman responded with a statement from Hannity that said: “My view of the Special Counsel investigation and the treatment of Paul Manafort were made clear every day to anyone who listens to my radio show or watches my TV show.” Hannity also tweeted the statement.The name and telephone number of the sender were redacted in the released documents. But the messages were littered with clues. In some messages, Hannity signed off as “Sean” while in others Manafort addressed him by that name. Hannity also referred to having had a long career in television and radio.In August 2017, Manafort’s texting partner referred to being 55 years old and having started out as a dishwasher and construction worker. Hannity, who was 55 at the time, has said he held those two jobs early in his adult life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0bd1ee209cf6cbc3a4669c849b0b02b767a20/0_11_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f5c82086065fccbde3fd5d4433d97","title":"why are we like this the psychology of procrastination","story":"From deleting social media apps to setting limits on your screen time – here’s how to deal with the existential malaise of putting off the important thingsYou know that thing you’ve been putting off doing? Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a700d87d6a7128ac44f0683fafc03d549d66f2fc/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d03d06bae4d8eebd5c1a8935750e5d9","title":"foreign office minister visit iran urgent de escalation","story":"Andrew Murrison will raise concerns about country’s conduct amid rising tensions A Foreign Office minister is to visit Iran on Sunday and call for “urgent de-escalation in the region”, amid heightening tensions between Tehran and Washington after an unmanned American drone was shot down.Andrew Murrison, the MP for South West Wiltshire who covers the Middle East as part of his brief, will raise UK and international concerns about Iran’s “regional conduct and its threat to cease complying with the nuclear deal to which the UK remains fully committed” during “frank and constructive” talks with the government in Tehran.The Foreign Office said the short visit on Sunday comes at a time of “increased regional tensions”.Iran claimed the downed aircraft was “spying” in its airspace and had crossed a “red line”. However, Washington said the incident had occurred in international airspace.“At this time of increased regional tensions and at a crucial period for the future of the nuclear deal, this visit is an opportunity for further open, frank and constructive engagement with the government of Iran,” the Foreign Office said.Donald Trump said the US was “cocked and loaded” to retaliate against Iran, but that he had cancelled planned strikes just minutes before they were to be carried out on Thursday after being told 150 people could die.Both the US and Iran have said they do not have any appetite for conflict. However, Trump told NBC on Friday that if it comes, Iran would experience “obliteration like you’ve never seen before”.“But I’m not looking to do that,” he added.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal.

Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Semi-official media in Iran report it has quadrupled production of the low-enriched uranium used for civilian applications. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca.

The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLast year, the US unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six other powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. International sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme. A senior Arab diplomat said sharply increased tensions would further harm the crisis-hit Middle East region.“De-escalation is very important because tempers are flaring… It’s very important we avoid confrontation right now,” they told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. “Confrontation, whatever we think about Trump or Iran, will be disastrous for everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9cf05bf676b1163fe62b573521cc683fcdf450/0_57_5296_3178/master/5296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bccf4933d120676b5c68417c34c4bd4","title":"putin bans russian airlines from flying to georgia","story":"‘National security’ measure seriously escalates tensions after clashes in Tbilisi during protests against visit by Russian MPVladimir Putin has banned Russia’s airlines from flying to Georgia, a day after a Russian lawmaker’s visit to the country prompted violent clashes between protesters and police.Putin signed the decree on Friday evening, saying the suspension of flights was necessary to protect “the national security of the Russian Federation”.According to the decree, Russian airlines will be banned from bringing Russian citizens to Georgia beginning on 8 July. The decree also ordered parliament to provide for the return of Russian citizens currently in Georgia and recommended tour agencies not to send Russian clients to Georgia.Putin’s decree will also hurt Russian airlines like Aeroflot, S7, Ural Airlines and Pobeda, which carry thousands of passengers each week to Georgia.The suspension of flights came after Georgians protested against a visit by a Russian MP who was allowed to chair a session of parliament on Thursday. More than 200 people were injured in clashes outside of the parliament building in central Tbilisi.Russia has reacted angrily to the protests, calling the events “an anti-Russian provocation”.Police in Georgia used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to stop protesters from storming the country’s parliament.The outcry began after Russian MP Sergei Gavrilov took the chair’s seat during an assembly of legislators from Orthodox Christian countries being held in Tbilisi. As news of Gavrilov’s appearance began to circulate, a crowd gathered outside parliament. By late evening about 10,000 people were massed outside the building, waving Georgian flags, chanting and later on, attempted to breach the lines of riot police and storm the building.Protesters gathered outside Georgia’s parliament for a second successive night of protests on Friday evening, demanding snap elections and the resignation of the country’s interior minister."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3933663.1561145475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse targets home help hours in plan to save 500m","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE submitted a paper to Minister for Health Simon Harris’s department outlining ‘savings in the order of €500 million in 2019’. Photograph: Tom Honan The HSE has targeted home-help hours for cuts as part of efforts to plug a €500 million hole in the health budget this year.Official documents seen by The  show the Government fears the HSE could face a financial “challenge” of half a billion euro in delivering services in the current year.The correspondence between the Department of Health and the HSE warns that “control of expenditure is of paramount importance and the need to secure these significant savings is integral to the success of the national service plan”.The HSE submitted a paper to Minister for Health Simon Harris’s department outlining “savings in the order of €500 million in 2019”.One relatively uncontentious area identified for cuts was the use of agency staff within the health service, but the Department of Health baulked at a suggestion from the HSE that home care packages (HCPs) were also in line for cuts.“There seem to be additional measures targeted in relation to HCPs and home help hours,” a senior official in Mr Harris’s department wrote to the interim head of the HSE in April this year. “It will be necessary for the HSE to confirm that these additional measures will not impact on the agreed service level.”There has been increasing concern within Government about recent sharp increases in health spending, with fears that another supplementary estimate may be needed for the Department of Health later this year.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has warned that such spending, if it continues through the year, “would represent a significant risk” to managing spending across departments and could impact the State’s balance sheet.Home help hoursThe Opposition pressed the Government on where it tends to make savings to curtail health spending and both Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin have repeatedly raised the issue of home-help hours in the Dáil.The documents were prepared as part of a new health service budgetary oversight process based in the Department of Public Expenditure and reveal the Government has now received a confidential plan to generate hundreds of millions in savings.As part of the plan, the HSE is expected to continue to operate restrictions on employment numbers except where there is specific business case for recruitment or where it is considered additional staff will be essential.Restrictions will also be put in place on the provision of home-help services or home care packages in some parts of the country. It is understood such services have exceeded official limits in some locations and the new plan will insist that these be brought back into line.It is expected that official figures to be published in the coming days will show the HSE recorded a deficit of about €70 million in the first three months.There were 6,310 people on waiting lists nationwide for home help services at the end of April and it was reported earlier this month that the HSE had effectively closed the home help scheme for all new entrants for the next five months.The HSE denied this but said local managers had been told to stay in line with their budgets “which may impact on their ability to provide new hours into the system”. It also said the allocation of “new hours will be based on clients’ needs and the resources available”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garrett Fortune says a note on two previous accidents was \u0026lsquoattached separately\u0026rsquoProtestors claim men were deported before being given chance to speak to their solicitorsAnother woman is in critical condition after incident on Crankill Road in BallymenaDetectives from drugs squad found up to 40 kilos of cannabisOfficers hope postmortem will establish if 57-year-old was the victim of foul playFine Gael defends plan at Cork meeting as activists challenge Ministers on policiesPort managers spent \u0026euro500,000 on flights, restaurants and entertainmentGovernment warns that significant savings are integral to national service planCLP\u0026rsquos Norman Spicer said State redress scheme could help avoid prolonged litigationViolence set to continue until key gang members are taken out of circulationFailure to endorse reforms could endanger sponsorship contracts, president warnsGarda\u0026iacute suspect two arson attacks on houses directly linked to gun attackHSE confirms plans despite tensions around medical staffing levelsTaoiseach raises prospect of new discussions but rules out tampering with backstopLack of convictions not due to inquiry flaws but fact employers are not prosecutableStaff at IT Carlow vote to reject agreement which could pave way for merger with WITSuspect arrested after holidaymaker attacked with bottle at pub in FuengirolaGarda\u0026iacute believe he was killed in Co Laois by a person known to him over a personal matter"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3933722.1561150068!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord it s all in a day s work for s%C3%ADoda and br%C3%B3d","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Michael D Higgins, with one of his dogs, and his wife, Sabina,   with Pat  and  Michael English at the Presidential Concert, celebrating Irish country music in Áras an Uachtaráin. Friday was National Bring Your Dog to Work Day.Michael D brought along Síoda and Bród for his working day.But there is nothing unusual in that. In the case of our President, the First Dogs regularly accompany him as he goes about his business in the Áras.For the working day that was in it, we asked President Higgins yesterday about his beloved Bernese.“The dogs are not merely ice-breakers, they’re also a great source of wisdom, and they must be protected from the stresses of the Anthropocene,” said he, showing off.That, and the sly feeding of treats from under the tables.When not Giving the Paw for Ireland, the presidential pooches like to hang out with Michael D in his study while he works. He keeps some gorgeous photographs of them, and the much-missed Shadow, in his desk drawer and loves showing them to people. He also has a growing collection of Bernese Mountain Dog soft toys, sent by members of the public, dotted around the office.Síoda and Bród are two of the main attractions during garden party season in Áras an Uachtaráin, when the question most asked of the President and his wife Sabina is: “Where are the dogs?”Usually hogging the limelight nearby or hovering in the vicinity of the cocktail sausages.Síoda is quite a refined young lady compared with Bród, who is an attention-seeking male and cannot resist a stage or a camera opportunity. Two big softies, they love all the fuss and notice, but never wander far from Michael D’s side.They are starring again this weekend at the final garden parties of the 2019 season.Youth organisations Macra na Feirme and the Union of Students in Ireland are honoured on Sunday. The theme for the day is “Participation and Transformation”, fitting in with the President’s continuing efforts to encourage young people to “take charge of change” and become more involved in decision-making processes.Meanwhile, the Áras hosted some of the biggest names in Irish country music at a special concert on Friday evening to recognise the work done by organisations working with rural communities around the country.Guests were drawn from a range of local community groups, along with representatives from national organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Irish Men’s Sheds, Volunteer Ireland, Irish Rural Link and farmers’ associations.The event was also a celebration of the Irish country music scene and among the performers were Robert Mizzell, Louise Morrissey, Jimmy Buckley, Margo O’Donnell, Pete St John, Michael English and Mike Denver, as well as the Airport Police Fire Services Band.RTÉ’s Shay Byrne was Master of Ceremonies.All in a day’s work for Síoda and Bród.Dining at the OireachtasCeann Comhairle Seán Ó’Fearghaíl is always looking for ways to make Leinster House more accessible to the public and a better workplace for the many who labour away within its confines.Along with Oireachtas staff and public servants, the number of people based in Leinster House is around the 1,000 mark when politicians and staff from all the parties, along with members of the press gallery, are taken into account.Ó’Fearghaíl has been very busy this year, launching exhibitions inside and outside the building to mark the centenaries of women’s suffrage and of the Dáil itself, while also staging social events such as charity fundraisers in Leinster House.On Tuesday, following on the success of his inaugural showcase last year, the Ceann Comhairle hosted his second All-Ireland Food Fair in the members’ restaurant on Tuesday. Ó’Fearghaíl is a keen supporter of quality Irish artisan and craft food and he believes the national parliament should be a place where this produce is championed.The showcase was pulled together by Kildare Farm Foods, a company which distributes Irish artisan produce worldwide and to high-end restaurants at home. Run by three generations of the Sexton family, the food comes from their own land and from 15 “passionate” producers from all over the country.“Over 100,000 visitors pass through Leinster House every year,” the Ceann Comhairle told us. “What we serve here is all of Irish origin but I would love if we could move beyond that to include high-end and high-quality Irish craft foods. We really should be supporting the producers here, of all places.”He points out that politicians can be “opinion leaders” in their own regions and it’s a good idea for them to know about the best that Ireland can offer. “We can encourage constituents to support and promote their local craft producers.”Tickets for Tuesday’s evening in the Oireachtas restaurant cost €20 a head. “Totally self-financing with no cost to the Oireachtas or the taxpayer,” stressed Ó’Fearghaíl, who hopes the food fair can become an annual event.Diners were presented with a mouthwatering buffet which included starters of Galway Bay smoked salmon and seafood chowder, Manor Farm crispy chicken wings with Kildare Farm Foods blue cheese dip and Kelly native oysters.The main courses were rack of John Stone sirloin of beef, dry aged in Longford, Manor Farm breast of Chicken, and rack of Wild Atlantic lamb from Duvillaun Beg island near Achill.Dessert was from Killowen Yoghurts and there was Cooleeny cheeseboard with relish from Wild About\u0026nbspin Wexford.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who is very careful about what he eats, called in and went home with a bottle of Wild About’s sparkling nettle drink, while Mattie McGrath was cock-a-hoop about the apple juice when he heard it was “crushed near Clonmel”.This was organic apple juice “from the orchard of Áras an Uachtaráin” which is specially bottled for the President by Con Traas of The Apple Farm in Tipperary and served at events in the Áras.A consignment of what people were calling “Apple an Uachataráin” was sent over to the Ceann Comhairle by President Higgins.There was music and a little wine. Julie Lyons, catering organiser on the Oireachtas side, arrived to pour a glass for the Ceann Comhairle from a wicker wine bottle holder.Naming namesFine Gael for Louth, Fergus O’Dowd, was in very bad form at this week’s parliamentary party meeting. It might have been something to do with his appearance on Monday on Virgin television’s Tonight show when fellow panellists included Eamon Dunphy, who took a few swipes at the Government backbencher.O’Dowd informed the party meeting he was fed up with, among other things, Fine Gael TDs being called “Tory boys”.He then had a right go at the party’s Ministers. Fine Gael may have 28 of them, but a deeply unimpressed Fergus said he could name only “10 or 15” of them at a push.“What are they doing half of the time?” he asked his fellow deputies.Damned if they could tell him.Fergus didn’t mention any names when he was delivering his rant, but for some reason, Eoghan Murphy from Dublin 4 was the one Minister who responded to the Fine Gael Tory Boy complaint.“Well actually,” laughed Murphy, “I worked for the Labour Party during Tony Blair’s time.”Meanwhile, given the sharp decline in fortunes suffered by Sinn Féin in the recent elections, we hope there was no plotting over the party’s leader at the recent Bon Jovi concert in the RDS.A large contingent from the party enjoyed the show, chief among them TD Pearse Doherty and MEP and prospective TD Matt Carthy, who are close colleagues from the northern end of the country and have figured in idle talk about who might replace Mary Lou McDonald in the distant future.A case of “Shot through the heart, and you’re to blame, Matt and Pearse from Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin.”Definitely not. They are big Bon Jovi fans and have attended concerts together in the past, apart from Sunday’s “This House is Not for Sale” tour gig.Politics and opticsMonday’s contrived footage and photos of the Cabinet travelling by Dublin Bus to the launch of the Government’s Climate Aspirations Plan in Grangegorman brought to mind the (probably apocryphal) yarn doing the rounds many years ago about the late Garret FitzGerald.The story goes that Garret, when Taoiseach in the late 1980s, decided he should do more to project himself as a man of the people. To this end, he decided he should be seen taking the bus home.So the Fine Gael leader bravely marched to the nearest stop with his aides and stuck out his hand when the vehicle with the correct number approached. He climbed on board and briskly addressed the driver.And then he bustled down the aisle to find a seat, to the bemusement of all.It goes to show that politicians have always been interested in “the optics”, but not to the obsessive extent they are now.Leo Varadkar, leading his hybrid Cabinet from a hybrid bus for the sake of the optics, might have seemed like a great wheeze, but it was on the same level of cringe as one of those stagey “getting down with the young people” photo ops.People either laugh or get more annoyed.As a matter of interest, almost all members of Cabinet travelled on the out-of-service bus for the first leg of their short journey. Just three of them managed the return trip.After the launch, and having taken care of the optics, the rest shot off separately, driven away in ministerial cars."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeUK dispatches Middle East minister to Tehran in efforts to de-escalate Gulf crisisFifth of Britons using cooking oil dangerously to achieve perfect sun tan, Asda warns\u0026#39Prowler\u0026#39 behind dozens of Wimbledon burglaries should have been deported years agoComment: There\u0026#39s no enchantment in an ice-cream van without the jingleBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedComment: Brexiteers risk a \u0026#39Boris betrayal\u0026#39 unless they play a ferocious final handDonald Trump confirms he will nominate Mark Esper to be new secretary of defenseNHS pressures sees emergency  beds used all year round, BMA warns  Half of plastic supermarket packaging cannot be recycled, Which? survey findsBBC comedy portrays Meghan Markle as ‘trailer trash’ American who threatens to knife Kate MiddletonMinister \u0026#39spiritually abused\u0026#39 the vulnerableJeremy Hunt interview: \u0026#39Yes, this is going to be an uphill battle, but I like to prove people wrong’Boris Johnson\u0026#39s record in office - and the truth behind his achievementsThe inside story of the Chancellor\u0026#39s dinner that ended with Mark Field suspended for forcefully ejecting protesterJeremy Hunt brands Boris Johnson a \u0026#39bottler\u0026#39 as gloves come off in Tory leadership race£230m British beef exports could be at risk if the UK government freezes out Huawei, China warnsCouples should start families earlier, instead of establishing career success first, says fertility expert More than 500 critically endangered vultures die of poisoning in BotswanaPolice called to home of Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds after reports of loud altercationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

Another 2,500 troops including soldiers from the Royal Gurkha Rifles arrived by Chinook helicopter as well as overland, some having driven straight from the D-Day ‘75 commemorations.Lieutenant Colonel Mark Swann, Commanding Officer of 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said his unit: “specialises in the rapid insertion of highly trained soldiers into hostile environments, and has the ability to sustain itself for long periods of time behind enemy lines.“The exercise is a significant logistical undertaking and a fantastic opportunity to test our capability.”Paratroopers prepare to deploy from the Hercules under tactical night-light conditionsA Canadian soldier taking part in the exercise was killed on Monday, when his parachute failed to open on a drop into Cheshnegirovo airfield near Plov, Bulgaria.Bombardier Patrick Labrie, a soldier in the 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, died as a result of his injuries. One other Canadian and two US paratroopers were injured at the same time.British reservists from 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment carrying Javelin anti-tank missiles.Supported by aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the Army Air Corps, Zadar airport formed the initial headquarters where 14 Apache and Chinook Helicopters lined up, much to the bewilderment of tourists arriving on Ryanair flights.The exercise was also an opportunity for part-time soldiers to train. Captain Zac Leong, a property developer from Colchester and reservist with the 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment, said: “It’s fantastic to come to Croatia and for reservist soldiers from all walks of life to deploy alongside their regular counterparts and develop new skills”.The exercise continues for the next fortnight in Udbina, 90 km north of the coastal city of Zadar, a British holidaymakers favourite.Troops will be deployed to defend the airstrip against an imaginary enemy alongside their French and Croatian counterparts. The exercise will focus on rapid assault tactics, airborne operations and fighting against a well armoured mechanised enemy.It will also enable the army to test new hi-tech equipment such as the Wildcat helicopter and a Puma Drone that can spy on enemy troops using infrared cameras at long range from the air.British soldiers in the back of a Chinook helicopter with weapons pointed towards the floor to ensure shots do not accidentally fire up into the engines.The British and French soldiers conducted both blank and live firing training in the rolling hills of the Croatian countryside.It has been a privilege to work alongside our British allies and share tactics and training,” said Colonel Renaud Senetaire, the French Deputy Commander of the 11th Parachute Brigade.“It is important that we continue to develop our strong military ties to protect the future of Europe. It’s about sharing our capability as an expeditionary force.”Nato airborne forces relax during a break in the exercise. This is the first time that the allied force has operated in Croatia. The scale of the exercise is clearly designed to put off any designs the Kremlin might have to further expand their sphere of influence in the Balkan region.The Russian President, Vladimir Putin has responded in recent weeks to what he describes as Nato aggression in Poland and the Baltic states.British officers were quick to deny any accusations of provocation in Croatia.Brigadier John Clark, who parachuted into Croatia himself with 3,000 of his men, said “The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with our international allies in both operational and training environments.“It’s important to remember that we are here at the invitation of the Croatian government.British reservists from 4th Battalion The Parachute Regiment with helmet-mounted monocle night vision sights.Croatia is a very strong strategic partner in Eastern Europe and we welcome the opportunity to develop strong bi-lateral ties as well as demonstrate the UK’s approach to joint exercises.“It sends a very clear message to our adversaries that we can project force over long ranges at very short notice.

And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May will remain as Prime Minister until a new party leader is announced in the week beginning July ."},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership race candidate brexit views","story":"Below, we take a look at whos still in the running - andfar-away favourite Boris Johnson could go all the way.The former Foreign Secretary quit his role because he disagreed with Theresa Mays plan for Brexit and is currently the bookies favourite to win the leadership contest.Boris Johnson was at the helm of the Vote Leave campaign back in  and nearly beat the current PM to the role after Cameron resigned.Since the referendum the -year-old has been brandishing his leave credentials. In a speech in Switzerland he vowed to take Britain out of the EU with a deal or no deal come October he gets chosen.Johnson said he would hold the EU to ransom and refuse to pay the £billion orce bill unless they agree to more favourable terms for Brexit.He also vowed to slash income tax for three million Brits.He said: Our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward.I always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write that entire cheque before having a final deal. In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.Johnson comfortably topped the poll from the first round of voting, securing  votes from his colleagues.This is well above the  needed to guarantee his place in the final two, making him a firm favourite as it stands.But supporters were reminded that only once in the history of the Conservative party has the favourite ever been elected.The Foreign Secretary who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum is the second favourite for leader.Jeremy Hunt claims his business background would help him negotiate a good deal with Brussels as doing deals is my bread and butter as someone who has set up their own business.The -year-old said he would back a No Deal Brexit with a heavy heartit was the only option left.Hunt has said he wants to slash corporation tax to boost businesses.On June  he claimed Germany’s Angela Merkel COULD renegotiate Brexit with a new Tory PM.He has the backing of Amber Rudd.While in second place after the first round vote, Hunt is trailing far behind Johnson with only just over a third of his share.But Amber Rudd, who is backing Hunt, said he came a good second and was delighted with the result.The Environment Secretary announced his bid to be the next Prime Minister on June .Michael Gove has said he is willing to delay Brexit for as long as needed to ensure a deal is agreed rather than just crashing out on October .He is posing as a unying candidate and said: I believe that Im ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country.Gove notably defended Theresa Mays Brexit deal in the House of Commons.However, his chances may have been dented by his cocaine admission.After the first round, Gove came a close third after Hunt and Johnson with  votes.The Home Secretary announced his candidacy in a video on Twitter and was one of the Remain campaigners in .Sajid Javid, , has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit but has positioned himself as a firm Remainer.But speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday he said: The policy of any government I lead will be to leave on  October. We will do everything in our power to leave on  October.I will do everything I can to get a deal, butI have to choose between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal.If elected the Bromsgrove MP would be the UKs first Prime Minister from an ethnic minority.He has pledged to end austerity and pump billions into education.Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson has given him her support.It is thought defeated Andrea Leadsom could back Sajid Javid after he secured  votes in the first round.In a moving message the Home Secretary insisted he was ideally placed to lead a Conservative Government that would aim to bring people from all sides together.He said: “We talked a moment ago about whether someone is Remain or Leave, whether someone is black or white, North or South, urban or rural, and whatever happens this is the number one thing, we have to address in our countrywe are staying together as a cohesive society.“I think it is incumbent upon all politicians, especially when we see around the world, in the US, Italy and others, there are politicians that want to feed off anger and feed off ision, that we as Conservatives always look at the best in people and try to bring them together.”He said he had lived with prejudice for most of his le – but believed Britain was the “most successful multi-racial democracy in the world”.The new International Development Secretary launched his leadership bid in The Spectator and has since told of his one-time opium use.The Penrith MP has been scathing about a No Deal Brexit and claimed it would be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest.Rory Stewart has outlined his intention to fulfil Brexit and use a citizens assembly and a grand jury to help parliament to hammer out a deal with the EU that works for the country.Stewart believes a No Deal Brexit would cause huge financial implications for Brexit and is focused on a practical deal.He said he would lock up MPs over the summer to get the deal done.Hes also said hell build two million new homes.Apparently undeterred by winning only  votes in the first round, Stewarts insists hes the only one who can stop Boris Johnson in the PM race.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In other words . . . the car was exactly as I’d left it.“Well at least they didn’t steal anything,” I mumbled. The first he’ll know of the truth is when he reads this. Tidiness isn’t one of my strong points and nor, it seems, is PM hopeful Boris Johnson in possession of the neatness gene.The photo of his Toyota Previa’s interior makes my messy misdemeanours seem very Mini indeed. Naturally, with the age-old adage of “tidy room, tidy mind” at the forefront of their smugly neat brains, plenty will make the leap that Boris’s untidiness makes him unsuitable to lead the country.His many critics might also throw in the other car-related evidence that, when he was GQ’s motoring correspondent, he accrued enough parking tickets to paper a downstairs loo and frequently misplaced the vehicle he’d been loaned.A potential PM needs to be across the small print of every situation, they argue, and Boris is just too “chaotic” to do so. But is that true  After all, Gordon Brown and Theresa May were sticklers for detail and look what happened to them.So perhaps it’s time for a “bigger picture” personality with the strength of character to lead the country through a series of inevitably dficult decisions while leaving the crossing of Ts etc to several trusted lieutenants.According to journalist Andrew Gilligan, who worked for Boris when he was Mayor of London, his former boss has the “factory setting” of one nation Toryism and the ability to “master detail whenever he wanted to” but seldom wanted to.“A leader’s job,” Gilligan adds, “is to set the general direction and tone, choose the right people and inspire them to implement it. Lots of folk can do detail.”My friends would tell you that, despite the chaotic mess of my office at home , I possess clarity of thought when it comes to work and le’s general admin.So let’s hope that,he becomes PM, Boris is the same.

It would just about hold her mascaras.ANY chance of seeing all of Prince Archie  So far we’ve been treated to a glimpse of his nose and one cheek when Meghan and Harry posed for the first post-birth photocall, followed by a pair of feet on Mother’s Day and, on Father’s Day last weekend, just his eyes.It’s like playing a royal version of Beetle Drive.LIAM GALLAGHER has given a “Father’s Day” interview along with three of his four children by four dferent women.He’s a lucky man that, despite his often erratic behaviour and, in his oldest daughter’s case, a -year absence, all the mothers have clearly brought up their children to bear no ill will towards him. Good for them.Not all dads are as lucky and, consequently, many spent yet another Father’s Day estranged from their children through no fault of their own.My thoughts are with them.VIETNAMESE model Ngoc Trinh is in trouble with officials in her home country after wearing this barely-there frock to a film screening at the Cannes Film Festival.Nguyen Ngoc Thien, Vietnam’s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, says: “Her outfit was improper, offensive and has caused public outrage.”A matter of opinion, of course, but he’s launched an investigation that could lead to a heavy fine for Ms Trinh. Personally, I found myself more intrigued that she was attending the premiere of A Hidden Le, a thought-provoking film about a conscientious objector who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War Two.Ms Trinh isn’t in it and, as far as I can tell, wasn’t reviewing it either. Meaning, presumably, that she was simply working the red carpet to boost not only the movie but her impressive .million Instagram followers who slavishly follow her every, choreographed move.No such thing as A Hidden Le in the modern world, eh In the morning and evening rush hour, you’re luckyyou reach ten.ENGLAND women’s football manager Phil Neville and his we Julie have completed a £million makeover of their home, including a cinema with armchairs that extend to become beds.Eek.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party. Turns out he’s been accused of plenty of bigotry himself.A whole bunch of social media posts from Patel attacking Israel and praising Corbyn were uncovered. There were “Zionists” hiding behind the Holocaust, a suggestion that Israel should be transported to the centre of the US and so on. The usual stuff.None of it surprised me – and he’s not alone in pushing this view. Is it any wonder anti-semitism is now so entrenched in the Labour Party, and in our country Bob lived in Zimbabwe. Bob was standing in the middle of a road at night when a car hit him.The car cartwheeled, killing both of the people in it. They were rhino-horn smugglers – scumbags who kill rhinos so the valuable horns can be sold in powder form to sad Chinese men who can’t get a stfy.Anyway, Bob’s now dead. But his le was not given in vain.Thank you, Bob.THE latest social media trend is the bubble-tea selfie. Japanese girls take photos of themselves with a carton of the sugary drink nestled between their baps.Nope, I don’t know why.The craze is spreading west, too.People have been seen doing it in Thailand and Vietnam.Will it reach here Well, it’s got to navigate its way through Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia – so I wouldn’t bet on it.THE Breakthrough Listen Project was a massive scheme using millions of computers.It was dedicated to finding intelligent extra-terrestrial le. It has found . . . nothing. Just light year after light year of utter silence.I think it’s time we accustomed ourselves to the fact there’s nothing out there and we’re all alone. The rest of the universe is cold, silent and devoid of intelligent le. Just like Canada.IT’S a shame to see Rory Stewart crashing out of the Conservative leadership race.Not because I agree with him about anything – I don’t. I’d just thought it was high time we had a PM whose real Christian name is Roderick.If people called Roderick ran the country we wouldn’t be in the mess we are now.Sure, Mr Stewart doesn’t use “Roderick”.He’s shortened it to “Rory” in order to sound more dashing and maybe a bit Celtic. Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler. Rory, I think, just means drunk Glaswegian eating a pie.THE bigger and richer charities get, the less likely they are to do the job they were set up to do. The RSPB is a case in point.It’s very rich indeed, with mugs like me paying for its upkeep each month.Incredibly, this organisation has flogged part of a crucial nature reserve near Middlesbrough – so a huge power station can be built on it. What possible right do they have to do that The RSPB says the Saltholme reserve is not one of high ecological signicance. But it was home to some of the UK’s most endangered birds. Not for much longer. At least the RSPB made a fast buck.HAVE you seen Joe Hart’s new tattoo  Christ help us all.It looks like half his torso has been draped in a torn bin liner.Joe doesn’t care what other people think of it – fair enough.But remembering his performances in goal for England, I wondera dferent sort of tattoo might have been more helpful. On one wrist the words: “Stand in the centre of the goal when facing a free kick, you idiot.” And on the other: “Have a go at catching the ball from time to time.”THE oldest woman in Europe has died at the age of .Italian Giuseppina Robucci credited her long, long le to avoiding alcohol.A week ago, however, the oldest woman in the UK died. Grace Jones was  when she popped her clogs, and put her longevity down to regular glasses of whisky.Hmmm.

But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re just trying to ride roughshod over us because they don’t care about older people.But it won’t stop me wearing my bikini.Kay, who used to model for fashion houses, says the dispute with the council began last May when she was given a Community Protection Notice , a new-style of Asbo .That was later withdrawn but the council took her to court and she had to give a general undertaking not to engage in behaviour which caused “harassment, alarm or distress”.But she denied shouting at the children and claims she only listened to talkSPORT on her radio in the back garden.She said: I don’t think any of the children were upset by my bikini. Young children don’t care what you wear.Whatwas on a beach  Would children get upset there too In April the council wrote to her sayingshe continued to breach the undertaking, which is in force until  December, they would begin committal proceedings in court.Committal proceedings involve charges of contempt of court and anyone found to be in contempt can be sent to prison for two months.Kay insists the dispute stems from the nursery’s decision to expand and build a car-park at the back of her home.She claims the nursery decided to turn the car park into an adventure playground but the owners are still waiting for retrospective planning approval.She added: They cut down lots of trees and plants and made a real mess when they did the building work.I can’t understand they are getting upset about me in my bikini after everything we put up with.What century are we living in for goodness sake A spokesman for the council said the case had caused a great deal of alarm and distress to the kids at the nursery.They said: We have tried to work with Ms Crane as much as possible, and whilst wearing a bikini is not a breach of the undertaking agreed in court, staring at the children, shouting at the children and watching the children playing whilst wearing a bikini in full view are some of the repeated behaviours that have caused concern and are classed as a breach of the undertaking.The number of notices - dubbed a “busybodies charter” - have increased by  per cent from , in   to , in  , according to Freedom of Informationrequests.They can be handed out for anti-social behaviour by council or police officers.Violating the order is punishable by on-the-spot fines of £ ortaken to court a fine of up to £,.

These new orders are a scandal in comparison - you can be issued with a legal order by a town centre warden filling in a form.“These powers need to be urgently reviewed, and drastic changes made, to avoid further injustice and innocent people being penalised.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Anti-social behaviour harms communities and can severely impact people’s way of le, which is why we have reformed the tools and powers available to tackle it.“There is a clear legal test for issuing a Community Protection Notice, and our statutory guidance highlights that agencies should have sufficient evidence to satisfy themselves that the behaviour in question is genuinely having a detrimental effect on others’ quality of le, rather than being a behaviour that others may just find annoying.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mh370 flight pilot agitated frayed nerves","story":"Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was widely reported by close friends and family as being distracted, agitated and withdrawn in the weeks before the aircraft’s disappearance.Mystery surrounds what happened to the Boeing  from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, which disappeared with  people on board from radars over the South China Sea shortly after take-off in March .In July last year, investigators released a -page report, saying the planes controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course.The responsibly for the planes route off course has largely been placed in the hands of its troubled married -year-old pilot.Shahs background and turbulent state of mind before the flight has been the focus for much of the evidence.His we, Faizah Khanum, revealed he spent solitary hours on his flight simulator and stopped talking to her before the death-e crash.Over the course of several interviews, she told police how her husband became increasingly distracted in the months leading up to the flight.I found him distant and dficult to understand’ she said.She told investigators that although they continued to live in the same house, Zaharie spent his time alone.Faizah said her husband was so withdrawn he hardly spoke to his sons and was not close to them.She revealed how he always spent time alone in his room with the simulator he had built himself.Its since been claimed he rehearsed the plane’s fatal flight on the home-made device.Faizah said: He just retreated into a shell.The mother-of-three said she became worried as her husband increasingly became distracted and withdrawn as their marriage crumbled.Shah had reportedly refused pleas to attend marriage counselling sessions to improve the relationship, and is said to have had extramarital affairs.His daughter Aishah was also interviewed in detail by police in Kuala Lumpur.The -year-old said during her final conversation with her dad she barely recognised him.She said: He wasn’t the father I knew.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Protesting pensioners, mostly ladies, filled the pavement outside the BBC’s northern HQ in Leeds. My, did they make a noise. And they were just one of  such demonstrations all over the country. Through the plate-glass windows of their plush offices, Beeb bosses must have got the message that the oldies are on the march. It must also be filtering through to the traitor Tory politicians who reneged on their manesto pledge to keep all pensioner benefits. Protesters waved placards showing a TV set with the message Don’t Switch Us Off! and they cheered as passing drivers hooted their support. Jacqueline Robinson, , from Castleford, is one cross lady.    She said: “I’m absolutely disgusted with the licence being taken away. “My father-in-law is  and the TV is his leline. He lives in the middle of the countryside, there are no buses at the weekend. The television is his best friend.” Another “Cas Lass”,  year-old Barbara Cotton, said: “We’ve earned it and we deserve it. “We’ve put up with things youngsters wouldn’t put up with. We were deprived – but we won’t be deprived again.” Bob Harris, , a retired electrician, added: “I’ve had a free licence for  years and now they want to take it away. People like me did national service – two years on pittance pay. “It’s outrageous and it’s the thin end of the wedge. Next they’ll have the bus pass, the fuel allowance and then attack the NHS.” Nearly . million old people will lose their hard-won concession in less than a year’s time. Most protesters are in no doubt who the culprits are – Tory ministers who forced this cost-cutting treachery on the Beeb. “The Government should fund the over-s’ TV licences not the BBC,” proclaimed their placards. Hundreds joined the nationwide protests, organised by the National Pensioners Convention. In Glasgow, demonstrators chanted, “BBC, BBC, Keep our Licence Free”. Billy Foster, , reminded the politicians: “Lots of elderly people are really proud and they will refuse to be means tested, and will end up without a TV, which is their only contact with the outside world.” Outside Broadcasting House, in the centre of the capital, Londoner Ian Burleigh insisted “It’s a stealth tax by the Government, hiding behind the skirts of the BBC. “I have great respect for the BBC, but they should have had the guts to stand up to the Government.” The mood over at the Beeb’s northern HQ in Salford, Greater Manchester, was just as vehement. Leonard Mather, an -year-old Korean War veteran, was “disgusted” by the actions of the Corporation and the Government. “Gary Lineker gets paid a fortune for Match of the Day, but they can’t do anything for people who have given so much for their country,” he said.    “The Government should step in and pay the licence fee. If they don’t, the Tories will get slaughtered at the next election as people are very angry.” He has a point. This is electoral dynamite. It’s not just those directly affected. They have sons and daughters, and grandchildren, who are just as passionate as their old folk. This campaign unites the generations. And,he fails to honour his  manesto pledge to keep pensioner benefits, it could well gather enough momentum to shorten betrayer Boris Johnson’s time in No. MPs will debate this injustice on July , after a petition gathered more than , signatures. The Mirror is campaigning to save the free licences, backed by celebs such as Len Goodman and Dame Esther Rantzen.

Katie Britton-Jordan and her partner, Neil, , spent around £, on a range of alternative treatments, including dendritic cell therapy in Mexico.And Neil, speaking to Derbyshire Live , has now admitted that he now depends on benefits to raise their five-year-old daughter Delilah, and to care for his elderly father. Katie, who died on May , aged , had chosen not to go through conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the NHS when she was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in June .Instead, she cut out meat and dairy from her diet, ate only organic foods and took supplements, all of which was already taking a toll on the familyaposs bills. Despite having a mastectomy, by Christmas , the cancer had spread to Katieaposs lymph nodes, liver, lungs and bones and she was in a great deal of discomfort.    When doctors gave Katie just three months to live, the couple withdrew cash from their pensions and raised money from friends and family to travel to Mexico for dendritic cell therapy and other treatments. One friend donated £, from money left to her by her grandfather. Others donated amounts ranging from £ to £,. By the time -year-old Mrs Britton-Jordan arrived in Mexico she was very ill. But her condition improved after the five-week treatment and her lymph nodes had reduced back to their normal size. She felt more comfortable. In total the treatments, which included hyperbolic oxygen chambers, infrared heart treatments, cold laser therapy, blood transfusions, and dendritic cell therapy, among others, cost £,. But it left the couple bankrupt and before long, Mrs Britton-Jordan became severely unwell again. Neil said: She was back in hospital and they said aposthataposs it - thereaposs nothing more we can do for youapos. The couple met at a wellness weekend retreat in Glastonbury back in , when Katie was  and Neil was .    They fell in love, started a jewellery business called Flash Jordan and eventually married in . Their first baby, Tilly Rose, was stillborn. Two years later Katie gave birth to Delilah. It was in June , when Katie was breastfeeding from her right breast that baby Delilah knocked her left breast and she felt an intense pain. Doctors at the Royal Derby Hospital performed a biopsy and scans before delivering the devastating news a few days later. Neil said with hindsight his we would have chosen not to have the biopsy because, he said, stabbing the tumour releases cancerous blood cells into the body. He added: We were told in no uncertain terms that she needed chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a mastectomy, or she was going to die, and that was the only option. We said we wanted to think about our options. We became second-class citizens as soon as we said that. The couple trawled the internet and were faced with a myriad of alternatives.    Katie opted to cut out met and dairy from her diet, as well as purchasing only organic food to eat. After two years the lump in her breast had grown, but the hospital would only perform breast-removal surgeryshe agreed to radiotherapy and chemotherapy too. Mr Jordan was appalled. He said: You canapost put conditions on an operation. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are both poisons. Instead they travelled to Bradford in April last year and found an NHS surgeon willing to perform the mastectomy. The operation went well but complications followed and Mrs Britton-Jordan ended up hemorrhaging. The tissue around her breast died and she was left with a huge hole in her chest - an open wound right down to the muscle. The couple complained to the hospital but it was not upheld. When the cancer spread to Katieaposs lymph nodes, liver, lungs and bones in December , the couple travelled to Mexico where the five-week dendritic cell therapy improved Katieaposs condition.    Her lymph nodes had reduced back to their normal size. But before long, Katie was back in hospital, with doctors saying there was no more they could do. Neil said: We had always talked to Delilah about how poorly she was. We explained that we were trying our best. But that day we came home and we told her. We had to tell her that Mummy was going to die. When she passed away all the family was around. I went outside with Delilah and we picked a load of flowers from the garden and we just placed them all around Mummy. She looked so beautul and peaceful. She even had a little wry smile on her face. Mr Jordan kept his we at home for three days after her death, and allowed his daughter to see her when she wanted.    He said: She had been in to see Mummy a few times, to give Mummy another kiss. At one time she was running around with bubble guns and playing. You could hear laughter. It was just lovely to see her accepting what had happened and getting on with le. She wanted to know why mum couldnapost be kept by the bed forever. That was a really dficult question that I couldnapost answer. We both had a cuddle and a cry. A celebration of Mrs Britton-Jordanaposs le was held at Markeaton Crematorium and donations were collected for the Me  Dee Charity, which provided a holiday for the family before her death.

Yellow severe weather warnings are in place for most of England, Wales and Scotland from midday Sunday until midnight on Tuesday. The third day will see the worst weather as potentially severe storms are described as likely Becky Mitchell, a meteorologist for the Met Office, said: Going into Sunday there will be a drastic change in the weather type bringing potential disruption. There is the chance of flash flooding and torrential downpours causing some travel disruption for commuters on Monday.    The band of heavy rain will move northwards going into the start of the week, and the yellow warning of thunderstorms will remain for both Monday and Tuesday.But the prolonged stormy band of weather will be followed by a sharp rise and a near record-breaking hot spell .A so-called aposSpanish plumeapos bringing hot air from Spain and North Africa could see temperatures as high as C. The rest of Europe is also expected to bake in record-breaking temperatures. Ms Mitchell added: The mixture of heat and humidity will push temperatures into the low s when the sun comes out, staying warm at night. The temperature is expected to rise further in the UK as the week progresses.  The average temperature for this time of year is between Cand C , and the temperature should stay above this for most of the weekend. The new batch of bad weather follows flooding in Wainfleet in Lincolnshire that saw  homes underwater. Residents in some  homes were told to leave as waters continued to surge last Saturday and more than two monthsapos worth of rain fell in three days. Ben Thornely, flood risk manager for the Environment Agency, said: We know how hard this last week has been for the people of Wainfleet and the surrounding areas whose home and businesses were flooded. Keeping people safe and helping them get back home is our top priority and we are pleased that over  people canto their properties today. An Anglia Water spokesman said: Weaposd like to thank local residents for their help and co-operation over the last week in limiting the use of their facilities. Weaposre pleased to say water levels in the network are now ing to normal, so people can use their toilets, showers and washing machines as they would usually.

Carlos Orosco, , said he feels like he has been given a second chance at le after tipping the scales at st lbs. Speaking on the Today Show, Carlos, from Saginaw, Michigan, told how he drastically overhauled his lestyle after being scared that he wouldnapost live to see his niece be born. At ft in, Carlos admitted he has always been a bigger person. But after moving out of his parents house in his late twenties, his weight ballooned. With no one to hold him accountable, Carlos said he turned to food and alcohol for comfort, no matter what mood he was in. Since Carlos could stillwell in every day le, and was able to play sports, he never thought his weight was a problem.    His diet would consist of fried food, fast food, bread, fizzy pop and beer. By the time he turned , Carlos tipped the scales at a massive st lb, and was wearing size -waist jeans. His weight caused him to develop a blood infection that caused severe swelling and ulcers in his legs.    Plagued with health issues, Carlos eventually booked an appointment with the GP to discuss weight-loss surgery options, where he was told by the doctor thathe didnapost make a change soon, he wouldnapost make it to his s. It was the wake-up call Carlos needed. Carlos was told thathe didnapost lose the required pre-surgery weight - st in six months - the op would be cancelled and his leline would be gone.    After meeting with a dietician, Carlos was put on a weight loss plan which involved completely overhauling his diet. He cut out fried food and alcohol and replaced that with lean protein, fruit and vegetables, as well as going for three mile walks every day. Carlos said: The first three months were really tough. I was constantly fighting urges and cried myself to sleep many nights.    But six months later, on the day of his weight-loss surgery in December , Carlos was just lbs off his goal weight and cleared for the operation. After his laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a procedure where  per cent of the stomach is removed, Carlos dropped another st in just a few months. But he found his weight plateaued at the st mark.    That was until he decided to take part in a k race in honour of a friend who recently passed away. Carlos walked the whole course, finishing an hour and a half later. But the buzz he got after crossing the finish line made him want to keep at it. Getting into running helped Carlos shed the rest of the weight, until he got to his goal of just over st.    Since then, Carlos has participated in  races and is now training for his first marathon in October. He said on the Today show: aposI feel like a new person, really. I have been blessed with a second chance, another opportunity. I realise that not everybody has the chance, has that second opportunity to do it, and thataposs really what it feels like to me, a chance to do things the right way this time.

Animal rights group L published the video yesterday showing the cows with transparent plastic devices on their side. The plastic porthole devices, known as cannulas, have been used for decades and is a relatively a common practise in industrial farming. The animals are known as cannulated or fistulated cows, and the device allows scientists to optimise and regulate their nutrition by observing the inside of their four stomachs.    However, the animal rights group has launched an online campaign demanding authorities ban the device, adding that the use of cannulas was a symptomatic of the way animals are considered as simple machines at our disposal. In a video released by the group, they said: As citizens, we call on the ministers for research and agriculture to immediately ban experiments aimed at increasing the productivity of animals. They have pierced a hole into the cowsapos stomach so they can regularly access its content. Employees come regularly to open the porthole to deposit food samples or take them out. Describing how the cows are being treated as milk producing machines, they added: The aim is to perfect the most effective form of feeding so the cows produce as much milk as possible.    They also explained how they had filed a complaint to the regional prosecutor in the Mans region, Fabrice Belargent over the illegal experiments and the serious animal abuses. The animal rights group added: For Sanders and those involved in intensive livestock production, which is the norm in France, these animals are nothing more than production machines, a basic raw material at our disposal. The facility belongs to French food research giant Avril which said the six fistulated cows featured in the video were closely monitored and observed extremely rigorously by vets. In response to the L complaint, Avril Group said: This process is used worldwide for research purposes only.  This is currently the only solution to study the digestion of plant proteins. They added: This analysis is essential for many advances in breeding and, in particular, to improve the digestive health of millions of animals, reduce the use of antibiotics and reduce emissions of nitrates and methane related to livestock. French TV host Nagui Fam, who presented the footage, lashed out at the inhumane practise. He said: For Sanders, these cows are just milk-producing machines that need to have their settings optimised. Today, dairy cows produce on average  litres of milk a day, which is five times the daily requirements of a calf.    He added: Other experiments are carried out on isolated calves in small enclosures. The pigs only have cold metal as their environment. The rabbits are prisoners in their small cages and they will know only these cages their whole lives. They will never get out. And the chickens, which are from fast-growing strains, are fed with a too rich diet and their weight is pushed to the extreme. They can barely walk.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"fountainhead megayacht spotted in tarbert harbour","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert enjoyed a short visit from the megayacht Fountainhead, a  Feadship built for American billionaire Eddie Lampert, chief executive officer of American store Sears.At .m , she is the th biggest yacht in the world, registered in the Cayman Islands.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The school, which is at the heart of more than  new homes at Letham Mains, is being funded entirely through developersrsquo contributions.Morrison Construction, which is also behind the development of the nearby East Lothian Community Hospital, was appointed to build the primary school, which will have  classrooms suitable for pre-school and primary teaching, a dining hall, social space and a two-court PE hall with retractable seating for performance and community use.Now the foundations and concrete base have been completed and the steel frame is being put in place.As part of the projectrsquos commitment to sustainability,  tonnes of ground soil taken from the site have been moved to other projects in the county, including a BMX track in Musselburgh.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, a Haddington ward member and cabinet spokeswoman for education, visited the site to meet with Morrison Constructionrsquos team there.She said: ldquoItrsquos great to see the progress that is being made on the new school.ldquoHaddington is growing, with people choosing to live here because itrsquos a lovely town with beautul natural settings and good transport links within the county and wider region.ldquoItrsquos important that we keep up with the pace of growth, have facilities in place to accommodate it, and ensure our wider community benefits from it.ldquoI look forward to ing to Letham Mains Primary School later in the construction process as it continues to take shape.Outside the new building, areas will be designed for outdoor learning, PE and play.Jim Hanna, Morrison Construction project director, said: ldquoIt was great to be joined by council representatives on site so they could see the progress we are making.ldquoWith groundworks and foundations complete, we are now under way with the steel frame for the new building which will start to provide the community with a sense of what the school will look like once delivered.ldquoMorrison Construction is committed to minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and local community.ldquoAlready during the project we have been able to ert hundreds of tonnes of soil from landfill for reuse at Musselburgh, and we look forward to maintaining a proactive approach to sustainability throughout our time at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-musselburgh-gala-2019","story":"Organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, the fun-packed event is adored by youngsters in the Honest Toun.From noon until pm, there is a range of activities on offer including shows, quad bikes, face painting and dance displays.Edinburgh magician Alexander the Great will enthral gala visitors with his magic and circus skills show and Dinky Donuts will be present to keep those hunger pangs at bay.East Coast FM lead the fun and games as compegraveres.Also present will be Musselburghrsquos Army Cadets, Air Cadets and Sea Cadets, with musical entertainment provided by the Penicuik and Musselburgh Boysrsquo Brigade Pipe Band.Representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership will also be on hand to discuss its work with the local community.The Brunton Bistro serves tea, coffee, sandwiches and pies in a marquee.For those who prefer a snack as they enjoy the many activities, Sizzlers are selling food such as burgers, bacon rolls and chips.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour.

The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

the delay, we remain extremely excited about the enhancements and improvements being provided for our customers.ldquoThese works will transform the swimming pool environment at Aubigny into a more modern and dynamic setting aimed at motivating and encouraging more people to get more active more often.ldquoAlthough the dry side facilities remain open at Aubigny, this extended closure of the swimming pool is not what anyone would wish.ldquoenjoy would welcome all our customers at any of our other swimming pools, which remain open.An email was sent out to enjoyleisure members which highlighted the problems.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, echoed Mr Axonrsquos disappointment.He said: ldquoEveryone is looking forward to the completion of this renovation, which will transform the look of the pool for the benefit of the many people who use this much-loved facility.ldquoWe are disappointed that, due to a supply chain issue outwith our control, the date for the poolrsquos re-opening has been now been revised from the end of June with a new opening date of July .ldquoWe appreciate this will be frustrating for pool users who will be eagerly anticipating the poolrsquos re-opening and we are grateful for their patience and understanding.ldquoIrsquod like to assure everyone that we are working very closely with the contractor, subcontractor and enjoyleisure to complete the project within this revised timeframe.The pool hall dates back to the s, with the refurbishment plans including the complete replacement of custom-fit ceiling window  and a new roof covering.Both pools ndash the four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool ndash were to be drained, with a new light ceiling covering replacing the wood cladding.A new energy-efficient lighting scheme is also to be fitted, which it is hoped will transform the look and feel of the facility.Existing wall tiles will be replaced with wall liner .The delay also means the pool will not be open ahead of the school summer holidays starting next Friday .While the pool and health suite are closed, the rest of the centre, including the gym, dance studio, sports hall and cafe, remain open.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe delay to the reopening of the Aubigny Sports Centre swimming pool will clearly be disappointing for local residents hoping to use the facilities over the school holidays.ldquoI hope East Lothian Council continues to work closely with the contractors and enjoyleisure to ensure there are no further delays.ldquoThe renovation is very welcome, but as the Haddington population grows we still need to explore how to further enhance and expand our leisure and sporting facilities to ensure they remain on a level with those available where in the county and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"oor-wullie-sculpture-arrives-in-east-lothian","story":"A total of  sculptures capturing Scotlandrsquos favourite scamp are scattered

Nowadays, it would be called wild swimming. Anyway, this is where we went. A pool in the River Forth close to Cobleland campsite, off the A to Aberfoyle. Its shallow enough for younger children at the rivers edge, and teenagers can leap off the river bank and e into the deeper sections. Its a quiet spot even on the sunniest days and is the perfect spot for a picnic. I remember my friend ing in wearing white football shorts ndash unfortunately for him they immediately become transparent. Embarrassing for a teenager but youll know better, wont you Pit stop: Nothing here, which is the joy of the place.

Stretching for two miles of uninterrupted golden sands and dunes, the West Sands is busy all year round with walkers, dog walkers and water sport enthusiasts.

At times the prom can be even more crowded than the beach, with cyclists interweaving with prams and wheelchairs as young and old take in the sights and sounds. Even away from the sand theres plenty for the kids to do, with a playpark and an amusement arcade always popular.Pit stops: Along the prom theres Miros, the Esplanade , the Beach House and the Dalriada bar all worth a visit, as well as ice-cream, burger and fish and chip outlets.

The prints are between cm and cminand belonged to a formidable creature that stood up to mtall. A short drive up the coast is a rocky tidal  near Duntulm Castle which boasts a sauropod trackway, a dinosaur which was a distant relative of brontosaurus and diplodocus.

In this astoundingly beautul part of the world there are literally dozens of beaches to explore .

Yoursquoll need a car to reach the path to the sand ndash therersquos a car park at Blairmore, a few miles north west of Kinlochbervie.

Therersquos about a mile of soft sandy beach in all and a rock stack, Am Buachaille ndash The Shepherd ndash standing at one end like an exclamation mark, but the great joy is that therersquos none of the paraphernalia of more popular beaches ndash just you, the sand, the Atlantic at your feet and the whole of Sutherland behind you.Pit stop: Ideal for a picnic before heading back to the car park, but therersquos also The Old School Restaurant just down the road, which has outside seating and old-school fish and chips.MARK SMITHSt Ninians Isle and Levenwick, ShetlandWhat makes it special  TranquillityA few years ago, I was fortunate enough to be given a whistle-stop tour of Shetland by Ann Cleeves, the crime author whose murder mystery books inspired the BBC drama series starring Douglas Henshall as brooding DI Jimmy Perez. Travelling north from Sumburgh Head at the most southerly tip of the Shetland mainland, therersquos no shortage of breathtakingly beautul coastline, but two spots remain indelibly ingrained in my mind. The magnicent golden sandy tombolo ndash a large natural causeway with sea on either side ndash that connects St Ninianrsquos Isle is glorious. Even on a dreich day nothing beats smelling the salty sea air and feeling the wind whip your hair as you stroll across the white sands. Another gem is Levenwick which inspired the fictional Ravenswick in Cleevesrsquos novels. It has a stunning, secluded beach where itrsquos nigh-on impossible not to kick off your shoes and go for a paddle.

Not only was it just down the hill from my grandmotherrsquos house in Bellshill but the site where the park now stands was once home to the mining village of Bothwellhaugh from which my maternal family hail. The Hamilton Palace Colliery ndash affectionately dubbed ldquothe Pailis ndash closed in . Its residents departed and the village was demolished.

To walk on this beach, surrounded by dune and hill, looking out to Taransay and the Atlantic beyond, is to acknowledge the smallness of humanity in naturersquos vast canvas.Sometimes you wonrsquot see another soul as you traverse the sand down to the clear, sparkling aquamarine waters of the shore, and even when the weather is fine and the beach takes on a Caribbean rather than Hebridean hue, the sheer size of the place ndash not to mention Harrisrsquos tiny population ndash means it never gets busy. True medicine for the soul.Pit stop: Just  minutes south of Luskentyre, the Machair Kitchen overlooks another stunning beach, Seilebost, and serves some of the tastiest seafood on the island.MARIANNE TAYLORAchmelvich, LochinverWhat makes it special  Remote sandy beach with small campsite off the beaten trackWithin easy access of Lochinver, Hermitrsquos Castle can be found on the rocky headland, above the odd fishing boat lumbering lazily nearby.

But it was a mania, and all manias are brief and slightly silly. What did we actually know about Rory Stewart  Principally that he didnrsquot look or sound like the other lot. He didnrsquot come across as a greasy, self-seeking weasel. Nor did he look like Theresa May. There was a pulse, for one thing. A personality. A hinterland even.But other than being refreshingly blunt about Brexit for a Tory, we didnrsquot know much. His big policy was not to have policies. No tax cuts, no spending pledges. He was, in effect, continuity austerity. If that had sunk in, the chatterati adoration might have waned.He was no miracle cure for our political malaise, but a symptom of it, a sign of how much people are yearning for an alternative to what theyrsquore being offered. That eagerness to believe in him, in the absence of facts, should have sounded an alarm, not a hosanna.It may be Mr Stewart, for all his apparent guilelessness, is only a smarter sort of self-seeking weasel.Yet he will be missed. When he was in the Tory leadership race, he was a brake on the worst impulses of the other candidates, constantly nagging them over how they might deliver Brexit by October , and that the EU sees the threat of the UK leaving without a deal as no threat at all. Do we really want to join Venezuela and Syria and trade on WTO terms Which brings us to Boris Johnson. The former foreign secretary isnrsquot a lock for Downing Street. His well-chronicled flaws mean he could easily stumble over the next month of party hustings and offer Jeremy Hunt a chance to strike. But as things stand, he is very likely to be the next Prime Minister.This is bad for Ruth Davidson, but possibly not as much as she fears, and good for Nicola Sturgeon, but possibly not as much as she hopes.The Scottish Tory leaderrsquos discomfort over her old enemy could hardly have been clearer this week. First she backed Sajid Javid against Mr Johnson. Then she backed Michael Gove against him. If the empty lectern from the Channel  debate had been running, shersquod clearly have been happy to back that too.Asked by STV news on Thursday whether she was backing ldquoanyone but Boris, she couldnrsquot even mention his name. She and other senior Scottish Tories worry Mr Johnson will prove anathema to Scottish voters.He has already providing the SNP with some choice ammo. His journalistic career is full of sniping at Scotland and the Scots. He didnrsquot really argue in  that a native Scot could never be PM, only an MP with a Scottish constituency, given the West Lothian Question.At the time, Tony Blair, a Scot, was standing for re-election. Mr Johnson, born in New York, didnrsquot attack Mr Blair. He attacked his expected successor, Gordon Brown, as he had a Scottish seat.But the comments were enough for Ms Sturgeon to get her teeth into this week. He has also been very rude about the FM personally, and she about him.So what are the Scottish Tories to dohe wins  In recent weeks there has been a conversation at the top of the party about how to handle the Boris problem.Should they cold-shoulder him, or coach him in the esoteric ways of Scottish politics and hold his hand through the constitutional minefield Itrsquos a bogus debate, a flattering delusion that suggests they have a choice. Ms Davidson and her party cannot distance themselves from a Johnson premiership because by extension they would be backing away from the Westminster system and the Union. That hardly fits with Ms Davidsonrsquos brand.So rather than fuel the SNP claim that Westminster is now so alien itrsquos only sensible to leave, the Scottish Tories can only embrace Prime Minister Johnson.The manic grin of Borista MP Ross Thomson aside, they may well do it through gritted teeth, their skin crawling, but therersquos really no option. Wersquove had hug a hoodie, now itrsquos time to cuddle a clown. For good or ill,Mr Johnson wins this contest, Ms Davidson is shackled to the great lummox.How bad might a Johnson premiership be  Pretty woeful, itrsquos fair to guess. He seems guided by neither plans nor principles. He may survive a while through a lizard-brain instinct for self-preservation, tacking to the centre ground to align with the protective mass of voters. He has already started to squirm out of his Hallowersquoen-or-bust position by saying Brexit by then is ldquoeminently feasible rather than nailed down. But the MPs who backed him because of his apparent Brexit hardline are not the compromising sort. He will soon come up against the same Commons arithmetic and red-faced irreconcilables who did for Mrs May.He may not last long enough to do Ms Davidson serious harm.Ms Sturgeon, meanwhile, is hoping he will be a long-term incompetent, ruffling feathers and setting teeth on edge every time he even mentions Scotland. She said yesterday he would be a ldquodisaster for the UK and Scotland. ldquoIt further demonstrates that Scotland and the rest of the UK are on dferent political trajectories, she told the Herald.But thatrsquos more standard wishful thinking. All things Tory are supposed to move the dial on independence. Just like Brexit. Butall the things the SNP says are boosting independence were actually boosting independence, Yes would be nudging  per cent in the polls. ldquoIt has got to the stage wherethe chicken crosses the road, it will be a boost for Scottish independence, David Mundell said in the Commons this week.

Not with his knees.Mr Stewart disgraced the profession of politician by taking off his tie in a marked manner during a televised debate. Hersquos also been criticised for the way he lolled about like a teenager on his chair, leading to accusations that he was practising pilates rather than paying attention.Oddly enough, these same chairs came under fire from anti-BBC conspiracy theorists who claimed they were deliberately designed to cause the candidatesrsquo legs to dangle, making them look even more ridiculous than theyrsquod already managed through their own efforts.Certainly, the whole show was a deplorable stitch-up, not only because of the standard-issue interrupting chairwoman but because members of the public were allowed to take part, adding an unwelcome note of cynicism to proceedings.A tone of wholesome integrity was supposed to be injected by the aforementioned Stewart, but it all turned out to be a bit of a pose, striking attitudes and trying to present himself as ldquodferent from the other Tories which, to be fair, he is on account of his deeply-held socialist beliefs.At least Boris Johnson, the Scottish independence candidate, has never promised wholesome integrity. He has suffered the worst in the jogging pics, since the papers keep using ones taken from before his recent makeover, when he was a bit of a bloater,that is the politically correct term.Hersquos up against the aforementioned Hunt, the last rival not to be booted out and someone who is hampered by being known as Theresa in Trousers, which is at least better than Theresa in Running Shorts.What a shower they all are. Perhaps it would be betterthey were replaced by Liam Gallagher, out of Oasis, who said this week that he wanted to be Prime Minister so that he could ldquosort this pile of s*** out. I see. Well, itrsquos a manesto of sorts.Alas, Mr Gallagher has previously said of such ambitions: ldquoImagine me stood there in my parka, yoursquove got to wear a f***ing suit.This is substantially correct and shows that, while he might manage to make an alliance with the anarchically attired Mr Stewart, Liam has some way to go beforehe reaches the presentational heights of Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt.++++ NOW Irsquove heard it all.

Breeding, Feeding, Succeeding.Rural Economy Cabinet Secretary, Fergus Ewing, who in giving the official opening address, reiterated his support for the beef industry and determination to reverse the continuing decline in the national beef herd.But saying is not doing although, in fairness to Mr Ewing, he dropped more than a broad hint that the Scottish Government is looking at an emergency support package for the beef sector. This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon. He will also sign copies of From Scuttle to Salvage at The Orcadian Bookshop on June , from am to pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Ms Sturgeon said: “I think that that should worry everybody who understands the damage that would do to Scotland, to our economy overall – and particularly to sectors like agriculture. That said, I think the possibility of averting Brexit has also increased since the European election.”The First Minister saidit was possible to get Jeremy Corbyn “off the fence” on the question of a second referendum, moves could be undertaken to build a consensus for gaining a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum: “So we are in this perhaps rather strange situation where the risk of no-deal is rising, but the risk of stopping Brexit has also increased and there’s a real sense that that is up for grabs.”Commenting on how much the Scottish Government could do to offset what she termed the “disastrous consequences” that a no-deal would deliver to many sectors, including agriculture and in particular sheep farmers who could face huge tarfs, Ms Sturgeon warned: “We will look to do whatever we can to help dferent sectors and dferent industries, but our first priority must be to do everything we can to avert a no-deal Brexit happening.“But we’re not going to kid people on about the extent to which we can mitigate the damage of a no-deal Brexit – it would be catastrophic andI say to people, ‘Yes, we can take away all of the damage of that’ then I’m not doing my duty in saying to people that it would be so serious that we need to double, triple, quadruple our efforts to stop it.”l The First Minister also launched a food education programme designed to teach children and young people about Scotland’s food industry. The Good Food Futures programme, which is backed by £ million of Scottish Government funding, aims to give children a greater understanding of where food comes from and the range of career opportunities available in the industry.The programme will also include support for more farm visits, healthy cooking lessons and put more locally produced healthy food on school menus.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"renegotiation calls are wasting time eu tells leadership hopefuls","story":"European Union leaders have warned the Tory candidates vying to become prime minister they are #wasting time# and won#t secure a renegotiation of the UK#s Brexit deal.At a summit in Brussels, EU chiefs sent a clear message the existing withdrawal agreement was the only basis for an orderly Brexit, with both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt calling for changes to the Irish border backstop.And European Council president Donald Tusk suggested that Mr Johnson, who led the Leave campaign in , was one of those who had earned a “special place in hell” for failing to plan for how they would deliver Brexit.Following the summit, German chancellor Angela Merkel said: “We made it very clear we wish to co-operate with the newly elected [British] prime minister.“We will enter into talks, but we underline yet again, that the withdrawal agreement has been negotiated.”When an extension to Article  was agreed in April, giving the UK until  October to raty the Brexit deal, Mr Tusk pleaded with British politicians: “Do not waste this time.”Askedthe Tory leadership contest was wasting time, Mr Tusk told journalists: “When it comes to Brexit as such, yes, I am afraid that you are wasting time.“But I can understand why – the internal problems of political formation in London.“This is something we should respect. I am not happy with it, but I have to respect the political reality.”AskedMr Johnson was among those sharing a “special place in hell”, Mr Tusk said: “I think intellectually, it’s really easy to answer this question. “I think you understand very well what I thought, using this metaphor.” Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt began their campaigns to win over Tory members yesterday, addressing senior Tory councillors in Westminster ahead of the first official members’ hustings of the contest today.Mr Hunt insisted that he could beat clear favourite Mr Johnson when Tory members cast their votes, claiming he was “someone they trust to be prime minister”.In an early indication of the campaign lines he will use to separate himself from the former London mayor, Mr Hunt said he would be a “wise prime minister who makes sensible calls” on Brexit.The foreign secretary insisted Brussels would be willing to listen to him. “The thing that’s not going to work in Theresa May’s deal is this Northern Irish backstop,” Mr Hunt said.“And who do we trust to change that, someone who the EU will talk to and negotiate with  “I’m that person.”Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Mark Carney rejected claims by Mr Johnson that a trade rule known as Gatt  would allow existing tarf arrangements to apply following a no-deal Brexit.“Gatt appliesyou have an agreement, notyou have decided not to have an agreement or have been unable to come to an agreement,” Mr Carney said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

A deep free-kick headed back across goal fell invitingly for Oates to clinically drill the ball home, before another quick counter-attack saw Daniel Simpson fire home after Lee Gale’s shot had been blocked.Their misery was complete when a long ball pumped forward saw Swanson misjudge, allowing Oates to complete his hat-trick at the second attempt.Shetland manager Kevin Main said after the match that he was #sick of hard luck stories this week#.#It was an extremely competitive match and one we were expecting. They won this competition two years ago, we watched that final and they’re a physically strong bunch of boys#.Despite the defeat, Main#s players can be proud of their exploits and he added: #“It#s been an absolutely incredible week.#It#s been full of full of highs#.This fourth place finish represents Shetland#s best footballing performance at an island games since winning the gold medal at the home games in . raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland footballers lose in anglesey football tournament semi finals ","story":"Shetland keeper Grant Wood saves well to keep out an attack.

A long ball played over the top saw Jones hold off the challenge of Richard Arthur, before coolly slotting past Wood.Shetland captain Richard Arthurwith the officials and opposition captain before the match.

From a corner youngster Ronan Grant tapped home after seeing the ball rebound off the crossbar.Revitalised, Main#s men went all-out attack, the level of their game causing panic both to the Ynys Môn players and home supporters. However, they were unable to truly test Paul Pritchard in the home goal, either in the remaining half an hour of play of five minutes of injury time.Shetland will now battle for bronze on Friday afternoon when they meet Isle of Man in the third-fourth place play-off match.Manager Main said after the match: #I#m very, very disappointed in regards of the result, but obviously very proud of the display we put on here in front of , people.#We took ten minutes or so to get into the game, but from there and they#re on I think we were certainly competing and then in the second half I thought we owned it and chasing that second ball.#We pushed hard, created chances, their goalkeeper pulled off a couple of great saves and on another day we may have made a decision by the referees.#It will be a tough one to take that, but once again we can take plenty of positives from it. We came here to compete at a higher level away from our domestic season, our domestic league and we#ve experienced some great highs and we were almost there to get into that final.#On how hard it would be to get his players up for the bronze match on Friday, Main said it would be #tough#.He added: #The guys are hurting but I#ve asked them to pick themselves up – and pick themselves up quickly, this is just part of character rolling.#There#s a lot of positive to take away. We’ll concentrate on those tonight and I am absolutely sure they will finish this tournament strong.#It will a tough game tomorrow against the Isle of Man tomorrow, but I believe they will desperately want to finish on a high and give these players a good memory – and a win tomorrow will do that.#. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"various properties at hjaltland housing 2 ","story":"We have a one bedroom, two person st floor flat available to rent.

whose heart-breaking stories include being tied to a fence and being left by the side of the road - are now ready to find their forever homes thanks to some much-needed TLC by the team at the rehoming centre on Teeshan Road. Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyThis is how many points youll get on your licence for these driving offences Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"this is how many points you ll get on your licence for these driving offences","story":"Drivers who accumulate  or more penalty points from motoring offences within a three-year period can face a ban from driving for up to six months, while six or more penalty points within two years of passing your driving test can lead to a license withdrawal and a re-test requirement.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

insurance mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret

UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

The backstop was agreed between Theresa May and the EU as an insurance policy in the event the UK and EU can not agree a trade policy and in order to maintain an open border on the island.The report highlights areas of cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Among those are an all-Ireland congenital heart disease network to ensure vulnerable children receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The report notes the network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast.Other areas that will be affected include major emergencies and AE services, cancer research and health promotion. In several cases this pre-dates the Belfast Agreement and membership of the EU.There is cross-border group of officials to intensy work on child protection which has been operationally since .A north south alcohol policy advisor group was set up at the request of the two respective chief medical officers to provide advice and a  for information sharing and \"joined up action\". The EU also underpins everyday services like the operation of cross-border taxis and mobile phone roaming services.Repatriation of waste, the prevention of the spread of animal disease, flood risk management, wildfire initiatives and horse racing are also listed in the study. One of the most major issues highlighted is cross-bordering policing and cooperation between An Garda Siochana and the PSNI. Both forces have expressed concern about Brexits impact on policing, including how to deal with criminals who flee across the border in the absence of the European arrest warrant system.Nineteen areas are listed as \"avoiding a hard border\" and include issues such customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures. The movement of medicine across Ireland is also listed as Northern Ireland and the Republic is currently treated as a single entity by pharmaceutical and medical device companies and will be subjected to checks unless EU regulations apply.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said the study reflects the range of formal and informal cooperation that currently occurs between north and south, adding that in several cases the cooperation pre-dates the Belfast Agreement and membership of the EU.\"It is worth remembering that in key areas like agriculture, health and education common policies are agreed formally but are implemented separately in each jurisdiction,\" the MEP said.  data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"The DUP’s MEP Diane Dodds \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The DUP’s MEP Diane Dodds \" width\"\" \"\"  The DUP’s MEP Diane Dodds \"Far from protecting this constructive process the much lauded backstop plan would fundamentally alter it. \"This is because it would uproot the normal templates of north-south cooperation.

As recently as last week members of Westminsters Foreign Affairs Committee visited the area and heard similar concerns.Read MoreBrexits impact on many cross-border initiatives finally revealed in reportAs we boarded the plane to head back to London news broke of what would come to be known as the backstop agreement between the EU and UK namely that in the absence of another solution to keep the border open with no checks and no infrastructure, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union and large parts of the EUs single market.In the joint report published by the UK Government and the EU the following day - December ,  - we had the first mention of the mapping exercise which showed how North-South co-operation, established under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, relied to a signicant extent on a common EU legal and policy framework.The document noted that the UKs departure from the EU \"gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South co-operation\".Hoping the mapping exercise would provide answers to the people we met in Co Armagh, our committee went to considerable efforts to secure its publication.We called for this to happen in reports in March, May and September .We wrote letters to consecutive Brexit Secretaries of State in April, August, October, November and December . We asked for the document, face-to-face, in April and July . Despite the publication of a technical explanatory note in December , we did not get the full story until this week, after it was obtained by a member of the public through a Freedom of Information request.The document, which we have now published, lists  areas of le in Northern Ireland that could be impacted by Brexit.It demonstrates very clearly that the residents of Armagh were right to be concerned, as many areas of co-operation are \"not underpinned or linked\" to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement.Its deeply disappointing that the Department for Exiting the EU did not choose to share this information with us or with the people of Northern Ireland. Its another example of the Government not giving Parliament the facts which we need to help inform our decision-making.The stakes are even higher now as the clock ticks and the Conservative leadership debate takes up some of the available time until October , just  weeks away.Alternative arrangements for the border are highly unlikely to be in place by then or indeed any time soon, which makes the transition and the backstop as important as ever. And as for leaving with no deal, our committee concluded in January that a managed no-deal cannot constitute the policy of any responsible Government.Hilary Benn MP is chair of the Committee on Exiting the European Union"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38243182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Lisburn_Armed_Forces_Day007.jpg","title":"thousands descend on lisburn for armed forces day in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Many Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"we can sort out border after brexit says boris as rivals for pm lock horns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate activist says mp who manhandled her has not apologised directly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

all visitors to the forest parks, with work ongoing to remove unauthorised trails which pose risks to mountain bikers.Over recent months, council officials have received a number of requests from event organisers for events that will use a combination of authorised trails, forest roads and unauthorised trails.While organisers are responsible for providing relevant health and safety risk assessments and insurance cover for the use of unauthorised trails, no adequate cover or permissions are in place post event which council officials have warned presents a ldquoconsiderable risk to the local authority and those using both natural and unauthorised trails.Councillors agreed on Monday night to meet with mountain trail bike stakeholders and representatives from Cycling Ireland to consider the ious challenges that would enable ldquothe responsible and safe management and maintenance of part of the natural trail network, with adequate health and safety considerations in place.It was also agreed at Mondayrsquos meeting to review the trail network at Castlewellan and Kilbroney parks in terms of the local authorityrsquos ongoing management and maintenance and consider future

It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed. It feels very appropriate, given my fatherrsquos very high standards and professionalism that The Moorwell is being designed and constructed with the same values. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”NIHE offices may close and move

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
