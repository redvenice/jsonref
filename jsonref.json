Famous museums across the Netherlands, from the Van Gogh in Amsterdam to the Frans Hals in Haarlem, opened their doors at risk of being fined. Also on offer to visitors were Tai Chi sessions and nail studios.

The objective is to keep dogs separate from areas used by bathers during bathing seasons, for health and safety reasons, Mr Diamond said.“This criterion is imperative in all regions where blue flag is operated. The rationale for restricting access of domesticated animals to beaches is that among the most common hazards in bathing waters are microbial pathogens introduced by faecal contamination from humans and animals,” he said.Meanwhile, some politicians in Kerry have said horses will also be banned from Kerry beaches apart from early morning and late evening.‘Nanny state’If the rules are not adopted, Kerry will lose some of its blue flag awards, director of Kerry’s services for beaches and water John Breen said.Promenades and car parks outside the beaches will not be affected.There has been strong reaction and Fianna Fail councillor Johnny Wall, former mayor of Tralee, who was co-opted onto the council seat vacated by Minister for Education Norma Foley when she was elected to the Dáil, said he could not support the proposal.Fianna Fail’s Mikey Sheehy said it had the hallmarks of the “nanny state” .Independent councillor Jackie Healy-Rae, a dog owner, said he feared for the tourism economy.

When the Omicron variant of the Sars Cov-2 virus was first detected in South Africa at the end of November, the alarm bells started ringing loudly across the world.The virus had mutated so dramatically in such a short space of time that there were fears it would undo all the positive benefits of the vaccine programme in Ireland and other countries.As the weeks passed, it became clear the virus was indeed infecting those who were already vaccinated and was far more transmissible than any of the variants that preceded it.But there was good news too. Early data from Africa and other countries suggested that people were not getting as sick with Omicron as they had done with Delta or the early strains of the infection.Scientists and medics urged caution, however. It was still too early to say how severe the impact of Omicron would be in this part of the world.But it now seems clear that Omicron has worked in our favour – at least to some degree.Tens of thousands of people were diagnosed with the illness every day at the height of the fifth wave of the pandemic in Ireland but while the numbers in hospitals climbed to in excess of 1,000, those who fell critically ill and ended up in ICU rarely went above 100.Now the case numbers are falling and it looks like the peak of the current wave has come and gone.Much of the talk today is about when and how Ireland will reopen, what Nphet will advise later this week and what the country will look like once the shadow of the pandemic eventually lifts.Today In The News talks to  Public Affairs Editor Simon Carswell and Prof Christine Loescher of DCU about how and when Ireland might re-open and the likely trajectory of the illness in the weeks ahead.In the News is presented by reporters Sorcha Pollak and Conor Pope.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"labour leader alan kelly calls for immediate end to covid 19 restrictions","story":"A phased lifting of restrictions is expected, with a return to normal hospitality trading hours and an increase in the number of people allowed at weddings and indoor and outdoor events first on the agenda. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Labour Party leader Alan Kelly has called for an immediate end to the restrictions on hospitality, saying he did not see the point in waiting any longer. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Mr Kelly called for any easing of Covid restrictions to be introduced immediately, if the chief medical officer Tony Holohan gives his approval.Mr Kelly was reacting to comments made by Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, who said that it could be a week before restrictions were eased to give notice to businesses.Mr Kelly said businesses should not have to “lose out” on another week, and there could be another shutdown later in the year so that week could be important to a business.Mr Kelly also called for measures to ensure outdoor events go ahead. He urged a return to indoor-seated events along the lines of requirements last October.Earlier, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that he thinks it will be “towards the end of next week” before Covid restrictions are eased.Mr Ryan said Ministers were likely to meet this Friday to consider anticipated updated advice from Nphet, but said this Cabinet meeting may be scheduled for next Tuesday.This would give the public a few days’ advance notice in relation to the changes, he said on Wednesday. “Towards the end of next week I expect that we will start to see the restrictions start to be lifted,” said Mr Ryan. Mr Ryan, who is Minister for Transport as well as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, said he was keen to see a return to social life.He told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland cultural and artistic activities and attendance at sporting events was important, as was a return to working in offices. Government sources have said they expect some restrictions to be relaxed from next week.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Tuesday evening told a Fine Gael party parliamentary meeting that he hoped March 31st would signal the end of most restrictions. It is expected that the lifting of restrictions will be phased, and a return to normal hospitality trading hours and an increase in the number of people allowed at weddings and indoor and outdoor events will be first on the agenda.Nightclubs will open after that.Mr Ryan on Wednesday cautioned that the severity of the Omicron variant should not be downplayed. “We have to be careful as Covid keeps changing. The situation now is a lot better than it was a few weeks ago,” said Mr Ryan.It was important not to prejudge the situation, he said, and referred to Denmark where rising Covid cases was a cause for concern. Mr Ryan urged young people in the State who have not yet received a booster vaccine to do so for their own health and for the health of the country.Earlier on Newstalk Breakfast, Minister for Sport Jack Chambers said there was room for optimism in relation to the easing of restrictions. He said the Government would engage with Nphet on Thursday, and all the public health indications were that the situation was moving in the right direction. The Omicron variant has not impacted on the country as badly as had been feared because of the vaccination programme and the resilience of the health service and its staff, he said.Mr Chamber said his target was a return to 100 per cent attendance at sporting events. “People want to get back into the stands.”While there was optimism in Government, any easing of restrictions would have to be done in a structured way, he warned. There were 979 Covid patients in hospital on Tuesday, with 93 of those in ICU. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre was on Tuesday notified of 5,767 cases of Covid, and a further 5,916 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"how the pandemic exposed the myth of the anglosphere","story":"A park bench in Brockwell Park, London, that was taped off to stop people sitting on it in the early days of the pandemic in April 2020. Photograph: Richard BakerIn Pictures via Getty ImagesYes, he might lose his job, US-resident Brits are currently having to explain to neighbours, friends and Uber drivers. Yes, the prime minister of the actual UK. Yes, over some office parties of less than Caligula-grade decadence.The bemusement of our hosts is not evidence of their slacker ethical standards. Rather, the problem is that Americans tend to underrate how harsh the UK’s lockdown was for much of 2020 – and how correspondingly provocative Boris Johnson’s breaches of it are.In turn, both countries struggle to believe the severity of the restrictions under which Australians have lived. A bid for “Covid zero” made the place all but unvisitable at times, even for passport-holding expats. Melbourne had no fewer than six lockdowns. Unable to renew his near-monopoly on that city’s Grand Slam tennis tournament, Novak Djokovic can attest to the strength of feeling there.All of which gives rise to a question. If there is such a thing as an “Anglosphere”, bound by a deep-seated culture of inidualism, why did the member nations erge so much over the pandemic? Aukus, a naval pact agreed between the three countries mentioned above last September, breathed new life into the idea of English-speaking unity.But the past two years have more often argued against it. The gamut of pandemic measures runs from the relative laxity of the US to, in the case of Australasia, perhaps the severest lockdowns in the western world. Some local authorities in Britain were taping up park benches to prevent strangers sharing them. Try doing that in Dallas or Miami. To the extent that Covid has served as an audit of national cultures, the findings refute the idea of a Washington-to-Wellington communion of values.For the US, with a $21 trillion economy and no express need for the outside world, this is an academic point. But for a midsized nation that has spurned its own continental market, on the hunch that its English-speaking former colonies can step in, the tenuousness of any Anglosphere is more troubling. It implies that national interests still trump (for want of a less loaded verb) ancestral fealties.Steel tariffsTellingly, the US still has steel tariffs on the UK, but not on the EU. Washington’s trade representative Katherine Tai is “confident that we will take this up when the time is right”. It is not known whether she was ruffling Johnson’s hair and praising the quaintness of Regency costume dramas while uttering those words.I spent long enough in Westminster to anticipate the Conservative response here. That is, a Republican administration would have been more generous to the UK. And so we have the paradox of the “special relationship”: it is at once fundamental and entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House.If any good comes of the past two years, it will be a sense of realism in Britain and elsewhere about the US. It is not, as even the French presume, an “Anglo-Saxon” country, whatever that means. It does not share political culture or institutions with the white Commonwealth. First, it broke from colonial rule much earlier and more absolutely than Australia, Canada or New Zealand, none of which are republics. Second, it absorbed such vast and such varied immigration as to become its own category of nation.Whether the events of 1776 constitute a “revolution” (Gore Vidal, noting that the domestic social order was not turned upside down, preferred the term “separation”), they ingrained a mistrust of the state. The consequences are evident in good ways and bad.“A Latin-Slav mixture”, one UK premier called America, and that was in the 1950s. In other words, even if you are a crude ethnic determinist, it makes no sense to assume an automatic coincidence of world views between the US and other countries that happen to speak English. It makes even less to bet your nation’s economic future on it. And given that the US accounts for the lion’s share of the population and economic output of the Anglosphere, that putative grouping has no meaning without it.AmbivalenceThe uniqueness of the US is recorded here with due ambivalence. On the one side, American inidualism prevented the most heavy-handed pandemic measures. It is increasingly plausible that the taped-up benches and Zoom-only funerals had a scarring effect that Britain and other nations will be reckoning with for years.On the other side, there is a pandemic death toll that now well exceeds that of the American Civil War. Either way, as Anglosphere enthusiasts struggle to accept, the US is different. It is not an overgrown Britain. Those who fawn over it most, understand it least. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia could replace europe top destination art lovers view monet","story":"Beijing and not Paris may soon be the place for art lovers to see Monet masterpieces, with Sotheby\u0027s revealing bids for his paintings from Asian collectors have increased 300 per cent.Five of the French Impressionist’s canvases are going on sale for a combined estimate of £35 million, auctioneers have announced, as they seek to cater to a booming demand in the Far East for “blue chip” European artworks.Sotheby’s figures reveal the proportion of global bids made by Asian collectors for Claude Monet’s work has quadrupled from 12 per cent of total bids in 2019, to 48 per cent in 2021.Experts believe the taste for his works, which has resulted in the £17.7 million Le Bassin Aux Nympheas, les Rosiers and a £19.8 million Nympheas painting being bought by Chinese buyers in recent years, will eventually make Asian cities must-visit destinations for lovers of Impressionism when collectors begin to show off their works in museums.  Thomas Boyd-Bowman, head Impressionist and Modern Art evening sales at Sotheby’s, said: “Traditionally we have had buyers in America and Europe buying with a view to placing works in museums.“At the moment, enjoying these artworks in Asia may be the privilege of collectors - but in time it is almost certainly going to become a place to travel to in order to view Monet works.”He explained that the five Monet works on sale, which show off his abstract side, match the modern tastes of a younger generation of collectors who are increasingly driving the demand for art in Asia.  Mr Boyd-Bowman said that for this new generation Monet is a symbol of taste like “expensive whisky or Western consumer goods”, and in terms of Impressionism he “signifies what they feel to be the apogee of the European art movement”.He added: “Monet has always defined Impressionism. He’s the leader of the pack.”Five works - all currently owned by one American collector - are set to go on sale in London, with the auction, including an 1897 depiction of chrysanthemums, projected to achieve £10 million to £15 million, and an 1894 image of grainstacks near his Monet’s Giverny home, also estimated to achieve between £10 million and £15 million.Also going under the hammer are an 1893 painting of an ice flow on the Seine valued between £5 million and £7 million, an 1897 landscape of the Norman coast expected to achieve between 3.5 million and £5 million, and an 1882 still life of plums and apricots worth up to £1.8 million.The sale, predicted to attract interest from buyers based in countries including China and Japan, follows the success of other Impressionist sales, including a 2017 auction which saw Asian collectors secure Monet’s Les Arceaux de roses for £14 million, and his study of lake ice for £19.5 million.The evening auction is set to take place on March 2.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch PMQs live as Boris Johnson faces \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 to oust himOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsCovid latest news: End of Plan B restrictions expected to be announced by Boris JohnsonTory MP Christian Wakeford defects to LabourBoris has cost the Tories their reputation for competenceMeet the MPs leading the \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 rebellion against Boris JohnsonMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris has cost tories reputation competence","story":"If you asked voters at least up to the 2015 general election what they thought of the Conservative Party, it is highly likely that one of the responses would have been that it is able to get things done. If Tory governments were not always popular, in the popular mind they have at the very least been seen as effective.For Conservatives, this has historically been a badge of honour – a key aspect of the party’s traditional self-image and their offer to the public, alongside respect for institutions, rule of law, an instinctive aversion to dramatic change, and a talent for winning elections. Indeed, at the 2012 Tory conference, Boris Johnson gave a speech in which he praised David Cameron’s government as “a broom that is cleaning up the mess left by the Labour government”. By contrast, it should surely now be crystal clear that Boris Johnson is himself a Prime Minister totally against the Tory type. Yesterday\u0027s Sky interview saw the man who delivered the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher pleading for his job because no one told him the function he was attending was a party (and therefore against his own rules) – laying bare the extent to which this Government is the result of a Faustian pact in which the membership sacrificed the Tory brand’s long-term reputation for competence in return for the alleged benefits of his star power. Faced with the Brexit ision and an anti-Semitic Marxist in charge of Labour, it’s likely a different Tory leader could have delivered a majority in 2019. (Indeed, Theresa May might well have done so in 2017 had she run a more disciplined campaign.) Whatever the truth of this, Johnson certainly isn’t looking like a sure-fire winner next time. In which case, the question must be: what is the point of the Tories under his leadership? With the PM’s personal allure gone, the governing party now just looks incompetent. So the opportunity – and the absolute necessity after 12 years in power – must be to elect a leader who unquestionably is capable of governing. Which begs the question: who in the field of potential challengers has the record of executive leadership and delivery to do the job?If the top three contenders are Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, then Hunt is clearly the standout candidate, with a serious track record of achievement. A Cabinet minister from 2010, he served in domestic and foreign ministries, including the Department of Health (for over six years). He is a sensible, evidence-driven and affable politician who emerged from government with his reputation enhanced and has had an excellent run as chair of the health select committee during the pandemic. Those who unfairly characterise him as relatively undynamic might remember that his leadership campaign was arguably stronger than Johnson’s (something which must explain his otherwise inexcusable sacking in 2019). Rishi Sunak has had a good pandemic. He is hugely respected by the Treasury and is clearly signed up to the post-Thatcherite consensus on economics. Unlike the Prime Minister, he believes in balancing the books. He is an attractive figure who looks very much like modern Britain, and a gifted communicator. This is all very promising, but the most difficult bit is yet to come: when the fiscal retrenchment starts, his mettle will be severely tested. Sunak has not been blooded as Chancellor in the same way that George Osborne was right from the start of his time in No 11. Until that happens, it’s difficult to say how he might perform as PM. Which brings us to Liz Truss. The Foreign Secretary is the great survivor, having been first appointed to Cabinet in 2014. She certainly knows how to market herself, and has honed the art of telling Tory activists what they want to hear. But is she any good? She prospered in international trade – though few of the deals she announced were genuinely new – but before that held successive domestic roles in which she was at best fine (as Chief Secretary to the Treasury), and at worst a disaster (as Justice Secretary). Compared to Hunt and Sunak, a bet on Truss looks much more like another Borisian Pact – a further departure from the previous, election-winning habit of picking leaders who can clean up what went before them. Whoever emerges as the favourite, the pork-pie plotters – today seemingly desperate for a change of leadership – will find their route to a viable replacement fraught with uncertainty. James Dowling is a former Conservative special adviser and a former Treasury officialMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch PMQs live as Boris Johnson faces \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 to oust himCovid latest news: End of Plan B restrictions expected to be announced by Boris JohnsonTory MP Christian Wakeford defects to LabourOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsMeet the MPs leading the \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 rebellion against Boris JohnsonVote of no confidence: What it means and what happens if Boris Johnson is ousted as Prime MinisterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape. But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch PMQs live as Boris Johnson faces \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 to oust himOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsCovid latest news: End of Plan B restrictions expected to be announced by Boris JohnsonTory MP Christian Wakeford defects to LabourBoris has cost the Tories their reputation for competenceMeet the MPs leading the \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 rebellion against Boris JohnsonMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt veterans share experiences serving ban gay troops","story":"The Government has launched a review into the experience of LGBT veterans who served during a ban on gay troops in order to learn from their experiences.The independent review, part of the Veterans\u0027 Strategy Action Plan, will seek to understand how the pre-2000 ban impacted gay personnel in the military.The Government said it would provide an opportunity for it to better understand the lived experience of LGBT veterans who served prior to 2000, including how being discharged from the military because of their sexuality affected their lives.It is understood there will be a call for evidence so that anyone with relevant experience comes forward.

Government’s broadband rollout because it is too expensive to reach them with cables, MPs have warned.The Commons public accounts committee said that ministers appeared to have “no clear plan” for getting connections to the remotest communities, where installing conventional broadband is not financially viable for private companies.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which is heading up the rollout, has previously said it is looking at emerging technologies, such as satellites that can beam internet coverage to remote areas.However, MPs warned ministers have not yet produced any details for how such a policy would work in practice.In a report by the committee released on Wednesday, MPs said that without a plan and funding from the Government, broadband companies were likely to miss out on these hard-to-reach areas because of the “prohibitively high cost” of connecting them.The report said: “Accelerating coverage through rollout by commercial operators, rather than by prioritising those areas it knows are hardest to reach, risks some of the areas that need improved connectivity most, being once again left behind.”The concerns come over the Government’s scheme to introduce gigabit broadband, capable of reaching speeds of 1,000 mbps (megabits per second), across the UK.Boris Johnson initially pledged to spend £5 billion so that 100 per cent of the country would have access to such a connection by 2025.However, the Government has since watered down that target, saying it is now aiming to hit 85 per cent of the country in three years with full coverage by 2030.MPs said they were “not convinced” ministers would even meet the reduced target by 2025 due to emerging delays in the contracts it is negotiating with broadband providers.Dame Meg Hillier, the chairman of the public accounts committee, said: “DCMS’ planning and project management here show all the signs of the previous rollout – that the focus will continue to be on the easier to reach areas and there is still no clear plan for the hardest to reach communities.”DCMS could not really explain how broadband has got as far as it has in this critical national strategy, beyond “thanks to Virgin Media”, and it still does not have a real plan for getting the rest of the way to its own downgraded targets.“What DCMS does know full well is it can’t rely on the private sector to get fast broadband to the hardest to reach, excluded and rural areas, and despite its repeated promises to do exactly that we are apparently little nearer to closing ‘the great digital ide’ developing across the UK nor addressing the social and economic inequality it brings with it.”Following the report, a spokesman for DCMS said:  It is misleading to suggest we are reliant on the commercial sector to hit our target which we remain on track to meet.We are investing £5 billion so hard-to-reach areas can get gigabit speeds, have already upgraded 600,000 premises, and in three years national coverage has rocketed from six per cent to 65 per cent.Our policies and investment also mean 97 per cent of premises can access superfast broadband which meets people\u0027s current needs and helped us through the pandemic.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch PMQs live as Boris Johnson faces \u0026#39pork pie plot\u0026#39 to oust himCovid latest news: End of Plan B

restrictions as the Omicron wave appears to be starting to recede.Embattled Boris Johnson is expected to confirm today that Plan B restrictions will be ripped up as he scrambles to save his premiership.Work-from-home guidance and Covid passes for nightclubs are expected to go on January , though insiders have suggested that face mask rules for shops and public transport could stay. The Cabinet is meeting to discuss the latest Covid data, with a statement from the Prime Minister expected on Plan B this afternoon.  No decision has been taken but Mr Johnsonaposs authority has been battered by a row over Downing Street parties. Work is also understood to be underway on whether to scrap remaining emergency Covid laws due to expire in March, such as rules forcing people with the virus to isolate. Anyone who flouts this law can be fined up to £,. Other powers on the statute book include the requirement to provide details of your address to NHS Test and Trace. Free lateral flow provision could also be axed - a step which was first mooted in the Governmentaposs Covid Winter Plan, published back in September. However Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi recently insisted that this wonapost happen immediately. Large-scale PCR testing could also be scaled back, which ministers are said to be concerned is not financially sustainable in the long run. A source told the Mirror: The focus at the moment is obviously what to do with Plan Bbut weaposll of course then start to look at what the next few months look like. Last night, a Government spokesperson said: Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced.Plan B was implemented in December to slow the rapid spread of the extremely transmissible Omicron iant, and get more jabs in arms.Itaposs thanks to the phenomenal efforts of the NHS and many dedicated volunteers that we have now delivered over  million boosters to people across the UK.The Omicron iant continues to pose a signicant threat and the pandemic is not over.

Work-from-home guidance and Covid passes for nightclubs are expected to go on January , though reports suggest face mask rules on shops and public transport will stay. Face masks in school, travel tests on arrival to the UK and daily contact tests could all also be eased. Boris Johnson is meeting his Cabinet to discuss the measures this morning and will make an announcement to Parliament at lunchtime.Health Secretary Sajid Javid earlier said he is cautiously optimistic that the Government can substantially reduce Covid restrictions next week - while No hinted an announcement is due within days. He told MPs it’s likely we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations as ministers prepare to review Plan B measures next Wednesday. Mr Javid is the third minister in a week to sound hopeful about lting Plan B measures.  New positive Covid cases have fallen % in a week with , recorded yesterday, and hospital admissions have plateaued. But deaths are still up % in a week to , and , people were admitted to hospital with Covid yesterday alone.Sajid Javid told the Commons: The action that this Government has taken in response to Omicron and the collective efforts of the British people have seen us become the most boosted country in Europe, the most tested country in Europe, andthe most antivirals per head in Europe.That is why we are the most open country in Europe. I have always said that these restrictions should not stay in place a day longer than absolutely necessary. Due to these pharmaceutical defences and the likelihood that we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations, I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to substantially reduce restrictions next week. Here are all the changes that could happen, or have happened already: Working from home guidance Since December  people have been urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. This guidance, which is not legally binding, is a key way of getting cases down - but the government says it has “immediate costs to the economy”. Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. As such, it is a key measure the Prime Minister will want to get rid of when England’s Plan B rules are reviewed.  Covid vaccine passes at nightclubs and big sports Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January. Boris Johnson would likely need to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could be fatal. Mr Johnson had suggested the definition of ‘vaccinated’ for a Covid pass would be updated from two to three doses. This has already happened in Scotland as of January  - but it will not necessarily be the same in England. Officials are still waiting for many people who caught Covid in December to get a booster, as being infected triggers a -day ban on getting jabbed. But face masks in shops and on trains might stay Face masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. But these face mask laws came before Plan B, and reports have suggested they could outlast it too. Sunday newspapers have claimed some face mask restrictions could be extended beyond January .  Masks in schools axed Englandaposs secondary schools have told students to wear face masks in the classroom since January . But reports suggest this rule will be axed around the time Plan B is eased on January  - or even before that date, as it’s not formally part of Plan B. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday: “I don’t want to see masks in the classroom for a day longer than is necessary. “And on January  we’ll review that and I hope we’ll be able to take it away.” Travel testing axed for the vaccinated Vaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But it’s understood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.If so, it is likely to coincide with the review of the plan B measures on January . Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad, depending on which country they go to. Daily testing for Covid contacts cut The self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this weekto at least five full days in England. Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, the rules haven’t changed yet - you don’t need to isolate, but you do need to take a daily lateral flow test for seven days. When isolation changes were announced last week, the government said it would review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too.The government said it would “consider the guidance for close contacts of people with COVID-, including around the advice for fully vaccinated contacts to take daily LFDs for  days.”So far no change has been announced. … And the changes already confirmed Covid isolation cut to five full days in England The Covid isolation period in England has been cut to five full days since January .Previously people who tested positive for Covid could be freed midway through their seventh full day of isolation,they test negative on days six and seven. That period has been cut by between  and  hours, after huge pressure from Tory MPs and a staffing crisis in the NHS.Under the new rules, people in England with Covid must isolate for at least five full days. They will then be able to leave isolation at the start of the sixth full day -they have tested negative for Covid on both Day  and Day .Your first full day of isolation starts at .am, the calendar day after you test positive or show symptoms. Soyou test positive at am, aposDay apos starts  hours later.This means the new total isolation time is, in reality, somewhere between five and six days depending on what time you went into isolation. UK Health Security Agency data shows around two thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of Day . This rises to %people have two negative lateral flow tests,  hours apart. In Scotland and Wales, the isolation period is still seven days . Booster vaccines for - and -year-olds All eligible - and -year-olds are able to book a Covid booster jab from January .Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk from Covid-. But recent data from the UKHSA showed two doses were not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron.More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, so will be eligible for a booster. However, not all are eligible now, as they still have to wait until three months since their second dose. About , teenagers are newly eligible now, and many of the rest should become eligible in the coming weeks. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Scotland Scotlandaposs limit on football matches and other outdoor events has been scrapped from January .Football matches and other outdoor events in Scotland were limited to only  people from December , meaning Boxing Day games were effectively fan free and Hogmanay festivities were axed.That -person limit has now been axed - followed by all other Omicron restrictions in Scotland from next week. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Wales Covid restrictions in Wales are being eased over the next two weeks, the Welsh Government has confirmed. Since Saturday, as many as  people have been able to attend outdoor event activities - rising from .

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

The senior civil servant is said to believe that for her inquiry to be seen as credible she has to speak to all key witnesses. While it is not yet clear whether she has already been in touch with the PMaposs former closest aide, she plans to be before publishing her findings into Downing Street gatherings. One source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. Cummings is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes. It would be extraordinarywe went through the whole thing and no attempt was made to interview him.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had said that the PM had waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering which then went ahead.  He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related.The under-fire PM broke cover for the first time in days on Tuesday to insist that he hadnapost lied to Parliament. In his clip to broadcasters, Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray. I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry.  Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me that the boozy lockdown bash in the No  garden broke Covid rules. Downing Street has fiercely denied the claims, backed up by several senior journalists, that two officials told the PM the event was “a party” before it happened.Deputy PM Dominic Raab said on Tuesday that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe had intentionally misled Parliament. But he dismissed the claim by Mr Cummings, who has become the PMaposs fiercest critic, that the PM had lied to the Commons as nonsense. However, Mr Raab described the event as a party before rapidly backtracking. Many Tory MPs are believed to be waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number are already in.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son. If anyone has a chance of building bridges with Prince Harry, it’s his father.

As many as  of the  intake of Tories reportedly plan to submit letters of no confidence in the PM tomorrow. One Tory said: “His time has gone.” And the partygate probe is to quiz Dominic Cummings who alleges Mr Johnson lied to Parliament.Angry Red Wall Tories are plotting the PMaposs downfall over the partygate scandal.The Mirror understands that more than  Tory MPs who were elected at the  election met at Westminster to conspire over the Prime Ministeraposs future. With the Tories teetering on the brink of civil war, one frustrated minister dubbed it the apospork pie plotapos as the MP for Melton was alleged to have been one of those involved. Another rattled Cabinet minister branded the Red Wall MPs a load of fu***ng nobodies in comments set to hammer relations still further.  One Tory MP was quoted as saying: “His time has gone.” Another said: “I think we’ve done it... The whips operation completely backfired. Colleagues now have a sense they aren’t alone.”In another blow for the PM, the Mirror learned that Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray will interview Dominic Cummings before presenting her findings into Downing Street parties.A Government source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. He is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes.Mr Johnson has been accused of lying to the House of Commons by claiming he thought that a bring your own booze garden party on May ,  was a work event.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had claimed the PM waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering at the height of lockdown. He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.  In a deeply uncomfortable broadcast interview, Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me the No  garden party was against the rules. This was even though his own Government drew up the rules which millions of other Brits had followed at the time. The PM, looking pale and drawn on a visit to a North London hospital, repeatedly refused to rule out resigninghe was found to have misled Parliament. Well, letaposs see what the report says, he said.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related. Downing Street has fiercely denied claims by multiple senior journalists that two officials told Mr Johnson the event was “a party” before it happened. Dominic Raab claimed that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe intentionally misled Parliament.The deputy PM then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Sky News presenter Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”  Rishi Sunak, tipped as Mr Johnsonaposs most likely successor, gave a lukewarm show of support for the beleaguered PM.The Chancellor said of course he believed Mr Johnsonaposs account to Parliament but refused to give him his full backing, abruptly leaving the interview after being grilled over whether he had lied.Downing Street has launched aposOperation Red Meatapos, a slew of policy announcements designed to appeal to the Tory base, including on migrant crossings and BBC funding.In another attempt to appease disgruntled Tory MPs, the Government will tomorrow set out plans to relax the remaining Covid restrictions in England. The PM is also claimed to have triggered aposOperation Big Dogapos to save himself by sacking several senior aides. Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray.  I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry. He publicly apologised to the Queen over claims of two separate parties in No  the night before Prince Phillipaposs funeral, where the monarch was forced to sit grieving alone. I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility, he said. Many Tory MPs are waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number had already been reached. Bury South MP Christian Wakeford became the seventh Tory to stick his head above the parapet and publicly confirm he had submitted his letter. Ominously for the PM, he warned that some of his Red Wall colleagues “have written the letters but haven’t sent them in yet”. Several Tories suggested they would rather wait until the May local elections - in which the party could be hammered - to get rid of the PM. One furious Tory told the Mirror: It’s not Operation Big Dog, it’s Operation Massive C**k. I don’t know where it goes from here.  We are grinding slowly to , butwe get  he will win the no confidence vote and notionally we can’t do it for another year. If there is a leadership contest, Sunak will win easily - but the party will fight like ferrets in a sack. Another Tory MP from an earlier intake said the mood against Mr Johnson was calming down among more experienced MPs and ministers. The MP added: But itaposs not among newer cohorts. Thereaposs a huge generational ide here as there was during the Owen Paterson affair. It will be the newer MPs who bring down the PM. I have never seen anything like it.

The national leaderaposs alleged contempt for the rules put in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus across the past two years has caused fury throughout the nation.In response to the frustration - which stems from millions of Brits making huge sacrices, including not being able to be with elderly loved ones - an investigation has been launched into the string of gatherings. At the helm of investigation sits Sue Gray, the most powerful person youaposve never heard of. Who is Sue Gray   Senior civil servant Sue Gray served as Director General of Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office between  and .Before this, she worked in the departments of Transport, Health and Work and Pensions. After these roles, she took a career break in the late s to run a pub in Northern Ireland before joining the Cabinet Office in the s.She now holds the role of the Second Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office, a role charged with leading on the Union and the Constitution.When is the Sue Gray report into Downing Street party allegations   The report is expected towards the end of this week or early next - the exact date remains to be confirmed. The reason no one has any hard and fast answers about the reportaposs release date stems from the additional revelations cropping up about more parties alleged to have taken place. What does the Sue Gray investigation cover   The primary purpose of Grayaposs report is, according to the Cabinet Office, to: Establish swtly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.The scope of the report initially set out to cover the Downing Street Christmas parties on November  and December , but the number of dates under the microscope has now been extended to include two parties that took place on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral on April . According to the terms of reference set out for the investigation: Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.They also state that: If required, the investigations will establish whether inidual disciplinary action is warranted. The terms set out that investigators will have access to documents and will be able to speak to staff throughout its course. Is the Sue Gray investigation independent  One key concern remains, however, about the independence of the investigation. This is because despite being at the heart of Grayaposs explorations, Boris Johnson is also the person who gets to decidethe next stage of the investigation can actually go ahead.After Grayaposs report, Johnson will have the final say as to whether the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, can actually start an investigation into any breaches of ministerial code.Speaking on the matter, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of Ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson. “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided. History will be justiably unkind to a truly terrible leader.

Johnson will need % or more of MPs to back him or end up losing his position. If he does end up winning, then the MPs will be barred from forcing another vote on his premiership for the next  months.

Writing in the British Medical Journal, their study claims that the rapid kits were not as effective in youngsters and students, even as all secondary school students in Britain are encouraged to use them twice weekly. Their findings said that the tests only detected  per cent of Covid positive children. When the children had symptoms of Covid, like a cough or change or loss to the sense of taste and smell, detection rates increased to  per cent.  This means only little over half the youngsters who had the virus were caught. The authors said their findings meant that lateral flow tests would fail to meet the minimum standards of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the US’ Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organisation. These three bodies all require Covid testing kits to meet a minimum of around an  per cent success rate.  The study only included samples taken by professionally trained iniduals and not self testing at home.This comes as Omicron cases continue to fall, day-on-day, amidst hopes the fourth waves has peaked.One of the authors, Dr Naomi Fujita-Rohwerder, of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care in Cologne, Germany, said: “Taking into account test-specic pooled results, no test included in this review fully satisfied the minimum performance requirements as recommended by WHO...the US…or the MHRA in the UK.  “This may affect the planned purpose of the broad implementation of testing programmes.” The report only examined studies that used eight dferent lateral flow kits, so some of the + tests available globally may be more accurate. All of the studie looked at in the new analysis were published between the start of  and May  meaning they will not have contained the Omicron iant.  The researchers did not offer any reasons why the tests had performed less accurately on children, or a comparative study in adults. Regular and freely available lateral flow tests are a key part of the UK’s response to Covid and containing it.

There were  viewers who felt that the girls hanging upside down from a football goal before one opened the cheese snack and ate it, condoned or encouraged behaviour that could be dangerouschildren copied it.Dairylea owner Mondelez UK said the adaposs purpose was to show parents allowing their children more freedom and the video included two supervising parents in the background.  Mondelez referred to a study that they said supported their view that a personaposs ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in, including when eating upside down. Based on the research, and because Dairylea was a soft food, they considered there was a very low risk of choking when eating upside down. The ad had also been given an ex-kids scheduling restriction, but Mondelez said they were no longer running it and would remove references to eating upside downthey used it in future. The Advertising Standards Authoritysaid it sought advice from the Child Accident Prevention Trust, whose view was that the scenario depicted in the ad represented a situation where there was potentially a high risk of choking. The ASA also noted that one complainant had reported that their three-year-old relative, after seeing the advert, ate their food whilst hanging upside down. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The ASA said: We therefore considered that eating whilst upside down was an unsafe practice and one which could be dangerous for children to emulate. We therefore concluded that a scheduling restriction was not sufficient to reduce the risk of harm and that the ad breached the Code. The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again, adding: We told Mondelez UK to ensure their advertising did not condone or encourage unsafe practices. A Mondelez spokesman said: We recognise and will abide by the ASAaposs decision but we are disappointed by the ruling. We carefully consulted with Clearcast to pre-approve the content of this video on demand advert prior to airing. It was aimed at adultsrather than young children and was deliberately scheduled away from programming likely to appeal to children under . As such, we believe it was unlikely to encourage aposcopycatapos behaviour by young children. We remain committed to responsible advertising and work with a range of partners to make sure our marketing meets and complies with all relevant UK regulations.

In the days after Christmas, Jacqueline Sievewright discovered that all her debit and credit cards were no longer working and that she didnapost have a ing bank account. The baffled -year-old borrowed money from her -year-old mum before getting hold of someone at Halax, which sheaposd banked with for years. An operator told her her both her inidual and joint accounts had been closed due to a computer glitch following the death of her husband Francis, who died of pancreatic cancer in October. Despite spending days frantically trying to sort out the issue, cash transfers and direct debits are still bouncing off of Jacquelineaposs frozen accounts. They blocked everything. My credit card, direct debits, standing orders, state pension and private pension was rejected, and money coming in, the Immingham, Lincolnshire woman told the Mirror. I am still grieving. Last Thursday everything just got on top of me. For two days I just cried and cried. I was so low I felt like ending it all. Jacqueline first knew something was amiss the week after Christmas, when her mumaposs attempts to transfer money into her bank account failed. When the former Norfolk County Council worker tried to log in to her online account, it told her she wasnapost registered. She called Halax where an operator explained that the issue was not due to a human error, but a computer glitch. Jacqueline then embarked on several days of calling the bank and sending in her husbandaposs death certicate in a fruitless bid to get the accounts brought back online. She later received a call from Halax telling her requesting a money from a branch would be pointless and that her complaint, despite being unresolved, had been closed internally. I canapost just rely on my -year-old mum for money, Jacqueline said. I spent two days from am to pm ringing round  dferent companies resetting direct debits and informing them of the change of circumstances. I then reinstated two dormant accounts with Natwest and HSBC so I could do some shopping. Two weeks on, Jacquelineaposs accounts have suddenly been reinstated by Halax, which sent her flowers as an apology. The confusing situation has been particularly dficult for Jacqueline as she recently lost her husband Francis. The retired banker fell ill in February last year and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the eight months before he died in October, he spent five and a half in hospital. Jacqueline was able to bring him home from hospital to be with her in his final days. A Lloyds Bank spokesperson said: “We were so sorry to hear of Mrs Sievewright’s loss and the experience she had when she got in touch. Mrs Sievewright’s accounts are up and running again, we’ve provided training and feedback to our team, and we’ll be getting in touch with her to put things right.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatWestHalax Inc.HSBCBanksHospitalsPensionsCredit cardsState pensionComputers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The surprising one-bedroom home located near the town centre of Ramsbottom in Manchester is being listed for £, - and is worthy of George Clarke aposs Amazing Spaces according to some. Based on Spring Street, the tiny house also has a pocket-sized kitchen-living area and a petite en-suite bathroom, reports the Manchester Evening News.And while this might not seem like anything out of the ordinary, the interior of the property has got people talking online - all because of the dimensions. The propertyaposs half-sized staircase is one particular eye-catching detail - as is the size of the kitchen. Some users on Twitter have blasted the layout of the property, while others say the house has real potential.“Everyone look at this terrible tiny house attempt,” a user named Hannah, tweeting, said. [It has] only two rooms and they’re both the worst use of space I’ve ever seen.  Others said the space made them feel queasy and that it had been built with little thought. However, other accounts defended the property, saying the right buyer could make it into a good home. “Yes, it is a pity, a tiny space but a decent interior designer or architect could make much better use, Gary Cummins tweeted.  GiveMeSpace added: “Narrowboats have had good layouts for decades, and I reckon the designer could learn a thing or two there too. The home, marketed by Pearson Ferrier, is an end of terrace home.

Decomposing bits of food were also strewn across the floor in addition to a layer of dust which suggested it hadnapost been cleaned for some time, David claims.He says hotel staff were apologetic but he worries rooms are not being deep cleaned amidst the Covid- pandemic. David told the Record: We booked a few nights away in Inverness to see some old friends and on the morning of January  I dropped my keys down the back of the bed, where the headboard is. I pulled the bed out and there was a dirty pair of ladiesapos underwear and there was also bits of food and a disgusting amount of dust. You could see it clearly hadnapost been touched in a while. We certainly didnapost expect a room like this, especially with the virus going round. The website of the hotel in Inverness, Scotland, promises daily housekeeping as part of its services.  And a statement from parent company IHG on the webpage promises: IHG has a long-standing commitment to rigorous cleaning procedures. However, David remains concerned that hotels arenapost giving rooms a proper clean in between guests. He added: The hotel staff were apologetic and switched our room and let us stay for nothing. That doesnapost bother us but people need to know whataposs going on in hotels. That area of the room has just totally been ignored. If it had been lovely and clean behind the bed and we found a pair of underwear you would think it might be a one-off. But it was clear the bed hadnapost been moved for a while. It ruined the rest of our stay. Youaposd expect to find the room completely clean, especially now.. A spokesman for the Holiday Inn Express said: Overall, the Holiday Inn Express Inverness has an excellent record for cleanliness however on this occasion there was a clear lapse in standards. The hotel apologised to the guest regarding this matter, which was immediately rectied directly with the guest.

Professor Spector from the ZOE Covid app said data suggests about half of all cases of Delta are being missed because people are only on the lookout for the “classic” Covid symptoms. Do I have Omicron or a cold  The Omicron iant has many symptoms that are similar to the common cold. According to ZOE data scientists, the top five symptoms of Omicron are:Runny nose Headache FatigueSneezing Sore throat According to the NHS, the most common cold symptoms are:A blocked or runny nose A sore throat Headaches Coughs Sneezing A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smellWith many of the symptoms overlapping, there is no guaranteed way to tell the dference without a test. Professor Spector said: For most people, an Omicron positive case will feel much more like the common cold, starting with a sore throat, runny nose and a headache. You only need to ask a friend who has recently tested positive to find this out. We need to change public messaging urgently to save lives. The safest thing to do, and the only way to know for sure, is to get a PCR testyou have any of these symptoms. You can book a test for free on the NHS website. What to do while you wait for your test results  Dr Habil Khorakiwala, founder and chair of Wockhardt Group, has uploaded a video where he shares six things you can do at home while you wait for your PCR test result. He explains: There are six simple precautions which you may take, and may certainly help in preventing the infection and definitely reduces the severity of symptoms, especially of Omicron.  These are as follows: Step one – gargle with warm salt water Gargle deeply with warm salt water, or a medical mouthwash, three to four times a day. This has been proven in several studies to reduce the saliva viral load for several hours. Step two – steam inhalation Steam inhalation can help ease your symptoms, whether it be a cold or Covid. This is a great trick to soothe and open nasal passages when suffering from a cold or sinus infection. Dr Khorakiwala recommends doing this two to three times a day.  Step three – avoid cold drinks Dr Khorakiwala recommends avoiding drinking cold and chilled beverages. However, itaposs important to stay hydrated, so Dr Khorakiwala recommends drinking hot water frequently. Step four – breathing exercises Dr Khorakiwala recommends practising some form of breathing exercises, such as deep breathing, for at least five minutes a day. Step five – physical exercise Try to do  to  minutes of physical activity daily. Those who arenapost able to do that much should do as much as possible without overexerting themselves. Step six – remember to wear a mask Most importantly, Dr Khorakiwala says we should wear the right-fitting mask properly. He says to only use three-ply surgical masks or N masks. Dr Khorakiwala continued: Avoid common cloth masks and fancy design masks. If necessary, use them only as a double mask over the recommended mask.

Using fake email addresses, he convinced her shed been drugged and sexually abused in her own home, and that they had bought a house togetherCarwyn Roberts used fake email addresses to torment and control his girlfriend Image: WALES NEWS SERVICEByJason EvansRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan  A cruel and manipulative man used fake email addresses and  identities to control his girlfriendaposs le – even convincing her sheaposd been drugged and sexually abused in her own home.Carwyn Roberts, , created fake identities of people in positions of trust, like doctors and lawyers, to spin a web of lies which ranged from the couple buying a house together to convincing the vulnerable woman she was pregnant. He also persuaded her to leave her job at a school by telling her heaposd secured her a new role with the local council. Mold Crown Court heard this week how Roberts subjected his victim to years of torment, which has had a devastating effect on her mental health.Jade Tufail, prosecuting, told the court how Roberts and his victim met on the dating website Plenty of Fish in  and immediately got along. Soon the defendant moved into her flat in Bangor and the relationship was described as amazing with the womanaposs young daughter referring to the defendant as daddy Carwyn. The court heard the womanaposs previous relationship had ended acrimoniously and had left her in a bad way – including engaging in self-harming – and she told her new boyfriend about these issues. The prosecutor said Roberts told the woman he had found out he was was inheriting £, from his grandfatheraposs brother and he would use the money to buy their dream home. The couple went to view houses and settled on one in a new Redrow development in Bangor, and Roberts said his familyaposs solicitors would handle all the legal work. In fact there was no money and there was no family lawyer doing the conveyancing work, and the emails the woman began receiving about the house purchase were being sent by her partner from a bogus account he had set up. This was to be the start of months of cruel deception perpetrated by the defendant. The court heard Roberts then began to tell his partner he was receiving prank calls from people claiming she was being unfaithful and that the solicitor was looking into who was sending them. As the weeks progressed the fake solicitor said he had found out that there were hidden cameras in her flat which had filmed her having sex with men, and he began to quiz her about her sex le. The woman was adamant no such activity had taken place but Roberts, through the bogus solicitor, told her the reason she couldnapost remember what had happened was because she had been drugged before being sexually abused and that the police were now involved. Miss Tufail said while this was going on the defendant created another fake person, this time a woman by the name of Amanda Davies who supposedly worked with him in the local authority, who also began emailing his partner. His victim was persuaded by Amanda Davies to give up her employment in a local school with the promise of job in the council, and Roberts even came home with a work badge in his partneraposs name along with training and induction materials. Again this was all a lie. Then one day the fake council email account contacted the victim to say her partner had been drugged at work in a leisure centre in Caernarfon by an associate of her ex-boyfriend. Over the following days further emails were sent, supposed containing information from a nurse, saying the drugging incident had affected Robertsapos sperm and he would now not be able to have children. The court heard how the victim broke down crying at this news as she had wanted a child with the defendant. The Amanda Davies email account then started giving the woman instructions about having sex with Roberts in order to maximise their chances of conceiving. Meanwhile the charade about the purchase of non-existent house was still continuing and even went so far as the victim, her daughter, and the defendant packing up their possessions ready for the move. Miss Tufail said that by this point the victim had effectively been brainwashed into doing whatever the people in the emails told her to do.The months of lying culminated with Roberts coming home one day with an ultrasound scan showing a pregnancy with twins and telling his partner she was pregnant.This was followed-up by emails from a doctor sent from yet another bogus account he had created. It later transpired the defendant had carried out extensive internet searches in order to obtain a fake ultrasound image. The court heard the victim was confused about the scan and emails from the doctor confirming her pregnancy but the couple went to see her brother to tell the family the happy news. It was the brotheraposs partner who spotted something was amiss with the scan and raised the alarm. The police were contacted and an investigation uncovered the full extent of the defendantaposs deceit. In his first interview the -year-old defendant claimed he had his partner had been duped by somebody  but in his second interview he changed his story and said he, in fact, was the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of his partner. In a statement from the partner which was read to the court she explained the impact the months of lies had had on her. She said she felt ashamed and manipulated and said Roberts had been aware of her vulnerabilities and had exploited every single one of them. Carwyn Grfith Roberts, of Cae Llyn, Llanaelhaearn, Caernarfon, had previously pleaded guilty on the day of trial to engaging in controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship when he appeared in the dock for sentencing. He has no previous convictions. Richard Edwards, for Roberts, said at the time of the offending the defendant was conscious of his own perceived inadequacies and wanted to make himself look better in the eyes of his partner. However matters escalated and – in his clientaposs own words – the lies got bigger and bigger. The barrister said Roberts was taking part in counselling to address the issues in his le and added that he was now in a new relationship with someone who aware of the court case and who was supportive of him. Judge Niclas Parry told Roberts thatthe offending were not so serious people hearing the bizarre facts of the case would be rendered incredulous. He told the defendant he had taken advantage of a vulnerable woman to control her le, adding: Your conduct was as cruel as it was manipulative and despicable. With a % discount for his guilty plea Roberts was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years and was ordered to complete a rehabilitation course and  hours of unpaid work. He must also pay £, towards prosecution costs. The defendant was made the subject of a lelong restraining order banning him from contacting his former partner or posting anything about her on social media. Speaking after the hearing Rhian Jones, senior crown prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Servicein Wales, said: The level of manipulation that Carwyn Roberts exerted on his partner is quite staggering and the effect on her mental health must have been awful. The CPS were able to build a strong case showing the number of fake accounts and emails could be traced back to him, demonstrating he had told lie after lie. The victim can take comfort in knowing that Roberts is now paying for the horrendous ordeal he put her through and we hope this helps her move forward with her le.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. At every turn the Queen has handled Harry’s behaviour with good grace, wishing him well and extending a loving sentiment that he and his family would always be much loved members of her own. With the season of goodwill to all now behind us, one may wonder how much is left.

But theyaposve had several homes together since they first started dating almost six years ago. After they became engaged, Meghan moved in to Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. But after their wedding, they wanted somewhere bigger to raise a family and went to the Queen with an idea. But according to a report the pair faced disappointment when the monarch rejected the request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.  The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate.

He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Before the birth of Archie, the couple moved into their Frogmore Cottage home, later than expected due to delays with renovation work. Itaposs just over two years since they moved out of Frogmore and started their new le in the US. But it has now emerged that Harry does not want to bring Meghan and their two children to the UK to visit, saying there is a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK. He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit.

So how can you tellyou have Covid  Main symptoms of Omicron The ZOE COVID Symptom Study has put together data of the most common symptoms and Business Insider then used to the data to create a list of the full symptoms.The chart is based on when the virus first started spreading among people in the UK.The top two symptoms of Omicron were a runny nose and a headache. These cold-like symptoms are dferent to that of what most people experienced with the Delta iant.% of people had a runny nose, while % said they experienced a headache at some point. Dr. Claire Steves, a scientist involved with the study, said: The most reported symptoms of Omicron are really very much like a cold, especially in people whoaposve been vaccinated.  The full list is as follows:Runny nose -%. Headache - % Fatigue - % Sneezing - % Sore throat - % Persistent cough - % Hoarse voice - % Chills or shivers - % Fever - % Dizziness - % Brain fog - % Muscle pains - % Loss of smell - % Chest pain - %.The list does not distinguish between the vaccinated or unvaccinated. Why have we not seen an end to restrictions   Omicron has proven to be slightly dferent to the previous iant of concern. Now the dominant iation in the UK since December, its apparently high levels of transmissibility have seen it sweep across the UK and cause record numbers of people infected. Vaccines and the mutation being less severe than others, according to scientists, means that deaths and hospitalisations have not reached the same levels of the height of the pandemic in .  Despite this, staff shortages and high case numbers can put key services under strain and restrictions are put in place to stop them from becoming overwhelmed.Plan B restrictions are due to expire on January , but a report by The Times says that face masks could stay, while vaccine passports are expected to be axed along with work-from-home guidance.

Rhianna was enjoying out in a bar in Newcastle city centre on January  when three of her female friends suddenly became unwell. The Northumbria University student said two of the group, who had been sharing the same drink, started to be violently sick at the venue - with one even needing to be carried out by a bouncer.Speaking to Chronicle Live , -year-old Rhianna said: When we got home their breathing was raspy and their eyes were dilated.  They could all hear what I was saying to them but they couldnapost make sense of it. Rhianna took her friends to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead as they became increasingly unwell. I called an ambulance as [my friend] Sara [Begic] was especially bad, she said. Her breathing wasnapost right, she was hyperventilating. She wasnapost responding and going in and out of consciousness. They werenapost any ambulances available but they said aposyou need to get her to hospital now.apos All three women underwent tests to see whether they had been spiked. Rhianna said they are still waiting on the results. Sara Begic, , from Durham, believes her drink was spiked during the incident and is now worried about going out again following her ordeal. The Northumbria University law student said: It was horrible. The last thing I remember is sitting with my friends. I knew where I was but I just couldnapost do anything. I couldnapost move my body and the bouncer carried me out. I feel quite unsafe going out now. The group of friends revealed that this isnapost actually the first time they believe they have been spiked while on a night out in the city. One of the students, who did not want to be named, said she was spiked by an injection in her leg on December . She became ill later that night and went to hospital to be checked out the following morning. I felt like I had been possessed and my body felt freezing, she said. It was like I couldn’t physically stop myself from shaking it was probably the worst experience of my le. I don’t feel completely safe going back out again. Rhianna said the friends reported the injection spiking incident to the police but believed that the venue had been unable to help officers because of its poor CCTV footage. As a result, they decided not to report the second incident, which happened at the same venue. However, the friends hope that sharing their story will encourage others to be vigilant when on a night out. Just because people have stopped posting about [spiking] doesnapost mean that it isnapost still happening, Rhianna said. Northumbria Police confirmed that an investigation is ongoing into the reported injection spiking incident and stressed that dedicated officers are on patrol to ensure the city remains a safe place for a night out.A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said: We can confirm we have received a report from a woman concerned she had been spiked with an injection while on a night out in Newcastle on December . “An investigation has been launched and enquiries into this incident are ongoing.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Northumbria PoliceCCTVCCTV footageTeenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Owners of The Isle of Barra Distillers decided to shorten the working week in a bid to offer workers more flexibility. The company says it hopes to give its tightly-knit team the opportunity to spend more time with loved ones and spend less time and money commuting. Ahead of the change, which began this month, employees agreed to work the same hours over fewer days - with people opting to work an extra two hours each sht. They have switched up their operation to make the transition work - meaning that orders are no longer being dispatched on a Friday. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Distillery manager Debbie MacMillan told the Mirror that the change was already having a positive impact. She said: The main kind of reason behind it is to offer work-le balance for each team member. Being on Barra, itaposs not so easy to get away without booking holidays so it lets staff travel to the mainland without hassle. Last weekend, two staff members took advantage and travelled for the three days they were off. Itaposs been a really positive start. She added: I think we felt two days a week was never long enough. Itaposs just given us more time. We donapost have to use as much holiday because we have the long weekend to get everything done. Itaposs already allowed us to have more time with family and friends. Itaposs already been more positive. Husband and we Michael and Katie Morrison, who founded the distillery, said: aposWe had discussions with employees to make sure this change will benefit everyone. aposThe four-day working week would provide employees with more free time outside of work, with no loss in pay.

The -year-old says the two major mix-ups have caused a heavy burden of stress, leaving her unable to properly grieve for her late mum, Stoke-on-TrentLive reports. Sharon informed Stoke-on-Trent City council after her beloved motheraposs death on December  and cleared the home.She ed the keys to the authority in a letter that clearly stated the address, she claims.  At the bottom, she included her own address in nearby Dale Avenue and contact details, as requested, in case there were any queries, according to Stoke-on-Trent Live. On December , Sharon was dumbfounded to received a phone call from a friend while she was at work, stating that council workers had forced their way into her home. She said: I was at work when I got a phone call, and I was getting lots of messages, saying the council were breaking into my house. I had to leave work and go home to find they had broken in through the front door. Apparently they had been told that I had done a moonlight flit and the house was empty. There were three vans outside. They had been traipsing though the house. My friend had told they they had the wrong address. By the time I got back, they had gone. The front door handle was all loose because they hadnapost fixed it properly. I felt unsafe in my own house after  years of living there. Sharon, who lives at the property with her -year-old son Reece, contacted Stoke-on-Trent City Council after the mix-up. She said: The woman I spoke to couldnapost apologise enough. They sent me a bunch of flowers and said they would compensate me for the time I lost at work, although I havenapost received that yet.  But it shouldnapost have happened in the first place. I canapost understand how the council could get the address wrong. Thinking that was the end of the matter, Sharon was at home watching TV on January  when her electricity and gas suddenly went off. When she spoke to British Gas, she was told the council had informed them her property was empty. She said: At first I thought it was a power cut but when I looked out I saw it was only my house. I rang British Gas and explained what had happened and they said I had been cut off.  She said they were told by the council in December that the house was empty and the account had been closed. I have had to open a new account to get it sorted out.Sharon, who works at Jackmark Engineering in Longport, says the situation has made what is already an upsetting time even worse.Iaposve not had time to grieve over my mum because Iaposve been so busy sorting out the councilaposs mess. Iaposm a nervous wreck and Iaposm crying all the time.It has been one phone call after another trying to sort out whataposs going on. Iaposve even rung Severn Trent to make sure my water isnapost going to be cut off as well. Iaposm disgusted by the councilaposs ineptitude. A city council spokesman said: Firstly, we would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Sharon and her family for their loss at this very dficult time. We have , council properties and regrettably a genuine administrative mistake was made on this occasion that incorrectly listed the tenancy for ending, which resulted in a lock change being arranged. As part of that process, utility companies are automatically notied at the same time. However, we appreciate this shouldnapost have happened and we have spoken to Sharon and apologised unreservedly. We have also told her we will also cover any financial costs incurred.

She was her grans main carer Image: Reach plcByKaitlin EastonReporterKelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter:,  Jan | comments A grieving woman who has MS is facing homelessness after being told she must leave the council home she lived in with her gran before she died of Covid. Caitlin Paul had been living with her gran Elizabeth, , on and off for five years before the pensioner was admitted to hospital with sepsis in February . The -year-old moved into her granaposs Glasgow council flat permanently to look after her beloved dog Buddy while she spent  months recovering in hospital and re-learning basic motor skills.Caitlin became her granaposs main carer when she was discharged from hospital on November ,  and the OAP was given a new wheelchair adapted home by Cadder Housing. The pair planned to put Caitlin on the tenancy agreement so she was officially on documentation but tragically Elizabeth caught Covid just days after being discharged from hospital. She died a short time later before the tenancy documents could be updated. Are you facing eviction unfairly  Email webnews@mirror Caitlin, who suffers from MS, will be evicted from the house tomorrow and has nowhere to go, leaving her homeless with two dogs.She told the Daily Record : Me and my gran were really close so I stayed with her all the time. Last year she was unwell and had sepsis so I had to phone an ambulance and she was taken into hospital.We got a call saying she wouldnapost make it through the night and then another call the night after that, but she did. She was in hospital for  months and lost all her mobility. She had to re-learn how to feed herself but she did - she was amazing.  She was a tenant in a flat with Cadder Housing but they offered her a specially adapted home when she was in hospital. I got the house ready for her coming home, and decorated it so it was nice and fresh. We had lots of balloons up for the day she got out of hospital. I even had a sausage sandwich ready for her as she hadnapost had one in ages.The family had a small gathering to welcome Elizabeth into her new home but tragically days later Elizabeth, Caitlin, her mum Deborah, auntie Jacqui, sister Beth and uncle George, all tested positive for coronavirus. Caitlin said: She got out of hospital and then we caught Covid three days later. My gran was ok at first, but a few nights later she went downhill and I had to phone an ambulance. She didnapost want to go into hospital. She was really upset and scared she wouldnapost get back out. But it was the best place for her as she needed oxygen. On Monday, November  my gran was told she was getting on Tuesday and an ambulance had been arranged to bring her home. That night she took a turn for the worst. The hospital called and told me to go up, but when I arrived to see her she wasnapost herself. We just had to sit with her until she died.  Elizabeth died in the early hours of Tuesday November  at Glasgow Royal Infirmary after her lung collapsed due to Covid complications. Tragedy struck again when Caitlinaposs uncle George - Elizabethaposs son-in-law - died from coronavirus in the same hospital on November  just four days later. The devastated family were left to plan two funerals and fork out thousands of pounds. Caitlin began to fear for her future as she was never added to her granaposs tenancy agreement. Less than three weeks after her granaposs sudden death, she met with Cadder Housing and on December  she was told their hands were tied and she was given three weeks to evict the property.  Caitlin was then admitted to hospital with MS and Cadder gave her an extension until January . I completely understand Iaposm not on the tenancy agreement but we never thought anything like this would happen, Caitlin said. I never wanted to stay here permanently, as Iaposm not in a wheelchair and the house could go to someone  who needs it. I only wanted to stay here until I had somewhere  to go. They told me to contact Shelter Scotland and said they had been trying to get me temporary accommodation through the council. My MS has got worse with the stress and so has my mental health. I havenapost even had time to grieve the loss of my gran and my uncle. I felt like they could have at least said you can stay until you find somewhere  to go. They didnapost even offer to help with storage.

So, when one woman failed her first driving test in her native London, instead of re-booking locally, she decided to travel approximately  miles to the Isle of Mull, just off the west coast of Scotland, in search of the UKaposs aposeasiestapos test. Constance Kampfner spent  hours travelling north, by car and ferry, having handpicked the test route after discovering it only consisted of one roundabout her biggest fear. However, on arrival, she struggled to find a single driving instructor willing to take her for her test, forcing her to turn to Facebook in desperation. I was determined I would pass my driving test the second time - I simply needed to optimise my chances. A quick Google search told me where I needed to go, the Isle of Mull. I booked for the earliest available date, in mid-December, she told The Times. For their lessons residents tend to head to Oban on the mainland, where the ferry to the island departs from. None of the instructors I got hold of fancied the trip, each warning me of high chances that my crossing would be cancelled in bad weather. I took to Facebook, where local paramedic Mairi took pity and offered her blue Mini.Constance was feeling confident, especially after learning Mullaposs single roundabout would not feature on her test and there was nowhere to parallel park - not to mention the stunning local scenery which glistened under the winter sun. When they got back onto the mainland, the test instructor told her: I don’t like to talk about people who fail their tests. Think of it as just not passing. Better luck next time, Constance.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Waves reaching up to  metres hit the outer Haaposapia island group, destroying all of the houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tongaaposs main island, Tongatapu, the prime ministeraposs office said. In Kanokupolu village on the island of Tongatapu locals have been pictured staring at trees that have been felled, buildings in ruins and everything coated in black ash. James Garvin, chief scientist at NASAaposs Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be equivalent to five to  megatons of TNT, an explosive force more than  times the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. The blast was heard as far away as Alaska and was probably one of the loudest events to occur on Earth in over a century, according to Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.This might be the loudest eruption since [the eruption of the Indonesian volcano] Krakatau in , Poland told NPR. That massive th-century eruption killed thousands and released so much ash that it cast much of the region into darkness. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haaposapai was completely destroyed by Saturdayaposs explosion, says Dan Slayback, a research scientist for NASAaposs Goddard, as well as Science Systems and Applications Inc. Slayback says the blast was so massive it even appears to have taken chunks out of the older islands nearby. They werenapost ash — they were solid rock, blown to bits, he says. It was quite amazing to see that happen.  With its airport smothered by volcanic ash and communications badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable, information on the scale of the devastation has mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. Planes sent from New Zealand show the damage from the air with images of the inundation caused by tsunami on the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.  A dficult humanitarian aid effort is now under way to help the survivors from the disaster. The Red Cross said its teams in Tonga had confirmed that salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash were polluting the drinking water relied on by tens of thousands of people. Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority... as there is a mounting risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea, Katie Greenwood, the Pacic head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.

The luxury yacht, whose price is confidential, could also be seen narrowly getting through river locks - where the slightest error could cost a fortune.Heesen spokeswoman Sara Gioanola said that it takes three or four months to plan a voyage due to the permits and certicates needed. We are used to taking our boats to the North Sea via canals and rivers - weaposve been doing so for the past + years, she said. After four years of construction, Heesenaposs -metre all-aluminium Project Cosmos, now known as MY Galactica, left her shed in Oss last Friday and began her maiden voyage through the Dutch canals and rivers in perfect weather conditions.No Heesen has ever been so celebrated when leaving our shipyard. Passing through the tight lock in Macharen on Saturday, with only  cm of clearance on each side, we had to wait for a calm day with no wind. Locks are not the only gateways we have to go through.  We must also pass under many bridges, where clearance is particularly tight. Beforehand, we perform physical measurements. These are paramount, especially now that the river waters are higher than usual. She added: Weaposve been doing so for the past + years. This is standard procedure with luxury yachts of this size when dealing with inland cruising. Waiting for the tide to fall is just aposbusiness as usualapos. Galactica passed Heusden with  cm clearance.  Arthur Brouwer, Heesen CEO, said: Building large and complex superyachts is exciting, both from an engineering and construction perspective. We are incredibly fortunate to have the best naval architects, engineers, and craftsmen in the country to build our yachts. In spite of all the challenges imposed by the pandemic.  We also managed to keep the construction of Project Cosmos, now known as MY Galactica, on schedule - which was no mean feat. Precision aluminium construction, high performance, and the finest Dutch craftsmanship are steeped into the DNA of this shipyard. Cosmos is the ultimate expression of our ability to build daring projects that stretch the imagination of its engineers and craftspeople.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

weekly to choose a dish, go to the shops to buy ingredients, cook the meal and eat it together.Recipes include nachos and truffles Once a month, a group of older people from the community would join the session for an intergenerational meet and eat.Now, the youth project carries out a class online, where one young person takes the role of head chef and demonstrates how to make their chosen dish – ingredients are delivered to the chef’s home by staff from the youth project, which received funding from Tesco Community Grants to do so.Beth Smith, lead youth worker, said: “Not only have the young people learned new recipes but they have also grown in confidence and fed their families.“We had been posting the dishes on Facebook and had quite a few comments from teachers at North Berwick High

Getting an understanding of your car’s true valueThough you might value your car highly – it might even hold great sentimental value for you – when you come to sell it, you’ll quickly discover that its true value is set by the market.Your car’s value will be affected by such factors as age, mileage, condition, and service history – but market prices are the biggest driver. So, it is essential that you get a good idea of its true market value before selling.. How to value your carThe good news is that getting an accurate idea of your car’s value is quicker and easier than it’s ever been. There are now many online websites – such as Motorway – that will provide you with an instant estimated sale price for your car based on current market data, just by entering your reg number.However, you could also scan the pages of Auto Trader and eBay to check what prices similar models are reaching in private sales.. Making an informed choiceKnowing what you want from the sale of your car will help inform how you sell. Ask yourself, what do you care about most  Speed, convenience, or final selling price If you just want to sell the car as quickly as possible – and are willing to sacrice a bit on the end price for convenience, then you should probably choose an instant car-buying website or part-exchange your car at a dealership.If you are more interested in getting the best price you can for your car, then selling privately on a classied website or online auction is typically a better option. However, before embarking on this, it is worth remembering that selling privately can be a long and drawn-out process and it might involve you showing your car to a large number of prospective buyers over a long period.. Pick the best selling route for youIf you do decide to sell privately, you might attain a higher price than you would at an instant car-buying website. However, you’re also picking a sale route with no guarantees. Plus, you will most likely have to deal with several prospective buyers coming to your house, putting up with timewasters, and potentially bartering over the car’s price.Until recently, private selling, part-exchanging and instant car-buying sites were the only way to sell, butyou want convenience and the best price for your car, you could try Motorway.Motorway will put your car on sale with a nationwide network of more than , veried car dealers – who will then compete to buy your car. Not only is it quick and easy, but with this free online service, you can potentially receive more than £, more for your car.. Preparing your carIf you’re selling to an instant car buyer or part-exchanging, you won’t need to do too much with your car except to remove your belongings from it before handing over your keys.If you’re selling privately, however, you should ensure that your car is looking as good as possible to avoid prospective buyers chipping away at the price at the last minute.Make sure that your car is cleaned thoroughly inside and out and –it’s worth your while – fix any minor issues, such as correcting small dents and scratches. Replacing worn floor mats and buying a good-quality air freshener is usually a good idea.If you are using an online service like Motorway, it is also a good idea to make your car look as good as possible, as their network of veried dealers will study pictures of your car before they compete to make you an offer.. Knowing when to negotiateThough you are less likely to negotiateyou use an instant online car-buying service, some will try to chip down the price at the last minutethey discover the condition of your car is in any way dferent to how you initially described it.If you are selling privately or part-exchanging then you should probably be prepared to barter over the priceyou want to make a good deal. When meeting a car dealeror prospective buyer ensure you’re armed with research about what your car is worth. You should always try to stand your ground and be prepared to walk away from the negotiationa dealer or prospective buyer tries to radically reduce the price when they inspect your car.If you have done the requisite research, this will give you confidence about the car’s true value – and you will know when a dealer or potential buyer is trying to pull a fast one.If negotiating with buyers and dealers seems daunting, consider using Motorway’s free service which will match your car with a veried dealer willing to pay the best price without the need for negotiating.. Getting paymentHowever you choose to sell your car, it is vital that you don’t hand over your car keys until you have been paid. Never allow a buyer to pay by cheque or promise to transfer the money later.A reputable buyer will understand you need to be paid before you hand over the keys – either with cash or bank transfer. If it’s a transfer, you need to confirm that the appropriate funds have reached your bank account – or request evidence that the transfer has been completed in the form of a receipt or digital transaction statement.Motorway’s service is totally free for sellers – and payment is always made by secure bank transfer.. After the saleOnce you have confirmed payment for your car, you should hand over your car keys , the ‘new owner’ section of your VC , and your service and MOT history.As well as informing the DVLA that you have sold your car, you need to cancel your car insurance and reclaim your road tax. Many drivers don’t realise road tax can be reclaimed after the sale of a car. The DVLA actually makes this process very easy on their website.This article was brought to you in association with Motorway "},{"url":null,"title":"best-crypto-exchanges-2022","story":"Once you make the decision to become a crypto investor, there will inevitably be a series of questions floating around your head.

However, since eToro is available through a desktop site and mobile app, this is one of the speediest and most user-friendly brokerage sites in the business. As for the benefits of using eToro compared with some of the other exchanges, there are some fairly obvious advantages.

On the downside, Binance isn’t quite as competitive when it comes to fees! How to Sign Up to a Crypto ExchangeNow that we have broken down some of the pros and cons of the main exchange s, we’d like to also outline just how easy it is to register with them. There is a fairly standard process required to open an online investment account, and in terms of personal requirements, you must be over the legal investing age and be a resident of a crypto-supported country. Providing that you satisfy these criteria, you can set yourself up with a new trading account by running through the following:The Registration ProcessFirst thing’s first, you have to actually create your online account before you can invest in any cryptos at all. This is required at all exchange s, in accordance with FCA, ASIC, and FINRAregulations. So, once you’ve decided which exchange site you’d like to joinyou must create a fresh username and password for that site. Your username has to be unique, and the password must be strong so that it cannot be hacked into easily. From here, it’s time to supply the site with your personal details. In order for the site to very that you are legally allowed to trade crypto, you must provide your name, DOB, address, contact information, and title. Once these details have been shared, you can then set up any security questions that you wish to implement for your account.

In order to do this, you can upload either a bank statement or utility bill, which usually needs to be a recent document .After you have submitted this information, your account should get veried within a few hours.Depositing FundsCrypto coins might be classied as digital assets, but your very first purchase of a crypto coin must be executed in fiat currency. This describes currencies that are legal tender in regulated countries, such as GBP, AUD, EUR, and USD . And in order to deposit some fiat into your account, you can choose between a range of supported payment methods on our recommended exchanges. In terms of the main methods, you’ll typically find a selection of the following:Making Your First Crypto PurchaseWith funds deposited into your account, you can start to browse through the list of coins that each  has available.

After all, anyone could shortlist a range of investment s and claim them to be the best. But that leaves users somewhat in the dark as they approach the decision as to where they invest. To avoid that, we’d like to highlight some key areas that you must look at before signing up with any exchange.User ExperiencePutting the actual range of products or cryptos aside for a moment, the user experience is often an overlooked area.

After all, you could sign up with the best crypto exchange in the world, butit is overly complex or dficult to use, your ultimate experience will not be satisfactory.Payment MethodsSome might also involve fees, which is why you must assess each of these things prior to processing a deposit or withdrawal.FeesFees can be charged by crypto exchanges for ious things. Of course, each of these fees takes money out of your account, and subsequently reduces the capital you have available for investing. In terms of what areas fees apply to, you could see fees for deposits, withdrawals, trades, and even for inactivity at some s. With that said, there are s out there that have all but eliminated fees for several of these areas. And the more you can reduce your fees, the more cash you’ll keep to invest.RegulationCrypto is a regulated market in many parts of the world, meaning that it is officially legal to buy and sell ious coins within certain borders. In this sense, you’ve not got much to worry about when it comes to the market as a whole. However, inidual coins certainly can fall victim to regulations in dferent countries around the world. Take XRP as a prime example - the Ripple project is still facing a legal battle against the SEC in the US, which has greatly impacted the price.Range of CryptosMuch like the range of payment methods discussed above, the more cryptos that a site has available, the better things are doing to be. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than identying a potentially great investment only to find that your chosen site doesn’t support it. But while an exchange might actually support your preferred crypto, you still need to identy what trading pairs are available for that specic coin.  gtgtgt Visit eToro here to get started ltltlt % of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this providerFinal ThoughtsWhen all is said and done, crypto exchanges are safe and reputable s that can be used to buy and sell ious crypto coins.

people starting to make tentative plans for the future.But then the new iant emerged and, with it, more restrictions came.Now cases are falling, the question on everyone’s lips is: “Have we turned a corner ”Here are some of your questions answered about the current state of play with Covid-.– Has Omicron “peaked” Well,you look at case numbers for the UK, they certainly suggest so.A total of , new cases of Covid- were reported on January , according to Government figures.The highest number of new cases to be reported on a single day during the current wave was , on January . vw,vw,px, px\"But, between those two sets of figures, there has been a key change in UK policy, which means the data needs to be treated with caution.From January , people in England who test positive on lateral flow tests no longer need to get a follow up lab test – also known as a PCR test – to confirm the result.This means some people will have taken the at-home test and may not have reported the result.Experts have always cautioned that case numbers don’t make up the whole picture, with hospital admission figures also key.– So what is this new data and why is it important The Office for National StatisticsCovid- Infection Survey examines a random population in the community and whether or not they have symptoms.Today’s headline results show that #COVID infections decreased in England, Wales and Scotland, but the trend was uncertain in Northern Ireland in the week ending  January  https:t.co xWMalLkSR pic vMjmiaxjD— Office for National Statistics January , This creates a more accurate picture of what’s happening on the ground.The latest figures show a decrease in infections across most parts of the UK and among all age groups apart from younger children.But rates are still high, with the latest data suggesting that an estimated one in  people across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland had Covid- in the week ending January .It is estimated that one in every  people in Wales had the virus in the same time frame.In England alone, it is estimated that ,, people in England had Covid- in the week ending January .– So what is going on in hospitals There are , people in UK hospitals with Covid-, according to the latest data.During the second wave of Covid-, the number of hospital patients peaked at , on January  .There are signs that, in London, where Omicron first took hold, hospital admissions are falling, which is another signal the wave has peaked. vw,vw,px, px\"While it is true that some of the people in hospital with Covid- will have been admitted for another clinical reason and had the virus coincidentally, it is undeniable that the Omicron wave has heaped additional strain on an already stretched health service.The latest figures show that % of patients with coronavirus in hospitals in England were being treated primarily for something .– Are all of the people in hospital with Covid seriously ill No. If you take a look at the data on the number of Covid- patients in hospital who are on mechanical ventilators to help them breathe, you won’t see huge dferences between now and August .The data shows two major peaks in the number of patients on ventilators, which occurred during the first wave, when the virus first came to the UK in spring , and again in January , when at one point more than , patients were put on a ventilator.There are still more than  patients in the UK with Covid- who are on mechanical ventilators.On Tuesday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation, said: “Omicron may be less severe, on average, but the narrative that it is a mild disease is misleading, hurts the overall response, and costs more lives.”– Omicron seems to be everywhere at the moment, so isn’t it just better to catch it and build up some natural immunity Health officials have strongly warned people not to try and catch Covid- on purpose.Every iant of the #COVID virus, including Omicron, is dangerous and can cause:-severe disease-death-further virus mutations and jeopardize the effectiveness of the tools we have to fight it\"Please, do what you can to avoid infection\"- Dr @mvankerkhove

unknowns, such as the possibility of long Covid.– So what does all this mean going forward The World Health Organisation said the pandemic is “nowhere near over”, but other experts said they hope that, by the end of , we could have a “flu-type” relationship with Covid-.This could mean extra steps are taken to protect vulnerable people as the virus ebbs and flows. It remains to be seen what this means exactly, with annual jabs and the enhanced use of antiviral medication both options.Either way, it is hoped that living alongside the virus will mean ato normal le with no further restrictions.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia. My own objective was to learn to speak Gaelic, a language I had not heard until I set foot on the island, which in those days was almost entirely Gaelic-speaking.Canna House, where Campbell lived with his we Margaret Fay Shaw, had much  to offer: a well-stocked Celtic library , and just as important, a series of Gaelic and literary visitors, arriving from all over western Europe and North America. Conversations at the dinner table were always lively. MacLellan of South Uist was still living, and though up in years was one of the best ever recorded and well worth visiting. century the Skye ethnographer Martin Martin remarks on the quality of South Uist Gaelic.Campbell had provided letters of introduction to his main Gaelic contacts.

When I stung my hand on the nettles, she said to apply a leaf of dock growing nearby.It gave instant relief, and she observed that the two plants were never far apart. She then recited a rhyme which I did not remember as well as I should have, but was able to recover years later from a neighbour from the Glen:‘Dock leaf smooth, mild, gentleThe nettle has stung me’Three decades later, when the project was only in its initial stages, John Lorne Campbell was approached about making available his extensive collection of field recordings to this national resource.As a long-time lover of technology as well as Gaelic traditions, he agreed without a moment’s hesitation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

It would have cost just £m to make up the shortfall for the rest of the financial year, but we were told this was not possible,” he said.“People across the North are currently engulfed in a cost of living crisis. We have seen a failure to support people dealing with massive energy bills, experiencing food poverty, welfare claimants and those on social housing waiting lists. During the peak of our pandemic minimal support was offered and took an age to be issued.“People were crying out for self-isolation support and mitigation payments. There was no proposal to bring forward proper mortgage payment support. This money could have done a lot of good and I cannot fathom why it was surrendered at a time of so much need and so little delivery from Minister Hargey.”DfC said: “The department’s   reduced resource requirements were ring-fenced and required Executive agreement to reallocate. In addition to the   easements declared, the department bid for and received £m of Executive funding in   to support areas of need. The department participates in the Executive’s in year monitoring rounds which provide the opportunity for departments to bid for any extra funding required or surrendering any reduced requirements for reallocation by the Executive.”The news comes after the Belfastrevealed that the Department of Justice handed back more than £m to DoF since the beginning of the last financial year.DoJ figures show that, over the course of the   financial year, £m in non ring-fenced resource expenditure  was handed back to DoF, while just over £m in capital expenditure was ed over the same period.Up to the end of December of this financial year £.m in non ring-fenced resource expenditure and £.m in capital spending was ed to the DoF.Related topicsDeirdre HargeyDepartment for CommunitiesDepartment of Finance Andy AllenMark H.

It was designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and came into force on January , .Commenting on the rise in freight traffic from GB into Northern Ireland, Mr Leheny explained the tougher controls at Dublin Port has contributed to the sht.And Jarlath O#Keefe, from Grant Thornton Ireland, said: The CSO figures for November confirmed that there has been a signicant increase in cross border trade on the island of Ireland in  following Brexit. This is due in part to businesses adjusting their supply chains to avoid the administrative burden associated with importing goods from Britain.”The Department for Agriculture , which is responsible for implementing the protocol, revealed a total of , checks were carried out on , consignments at Northern Ireland’s ports between January , and December , .On average, a total of , trailers or vehicles from GB pass through Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint ports each year.Sanitary and Phytosanitaryconsignments subject to checks includes live animals, products of animal origin, plant and plant products, and high risk food not of animal origin.The three types of checks required are documentary, identity and physical. Straightforward documentaryand identitychecks made up , of the total checks in . Only , physical checks had to be carried out on lorries.Mr Leheny explained physical checks, which can last for several hours, are a “last resort”the documentary or identity paperwork is not up to scratch.He added that the number of consignment checks would have created a lot more admin work for DAERA officials, hauliers and traders.“A physical inspection is a last resort so it’s natural that would be as low as it is becausethe documentation doesn#t give DAERA the information they need well then they have to open up the doors,” said Mr Leheny.“They would say it’s potentially an unknown load so we have to physically open up the trailer and see what’s in it.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson felt the figures should act as a “sobering statistic” for those who think the protocol is necessary. Behind those figures is a story of additional costs, delays, disrupted supply chains and products which had to be disposed of because checks meant goods got ruined,” he said.DUP MLA Diane Dodds added that % of all EU checks take place between GB and Northern Ireland and the figures highlight “the scale of the Irish Sea border imposed by the protocol”.“It is % more expensive to transport goods into Northern Ireland now because of the protocol#s paperwork costs,” she continued. “The Government has a responsibility to take action and we need to see a timetable for progress quickly set out.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the “best way” to reduce checks at ports is for the UK Government to agree to an EU proposal for a Swiss-style veterinary agreement, which would remove almost all physical SPS checks.“We have been making this proposal for months because we know that it will reduce checks and controls by %,” said the Foyle MP.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the SPS checks are a product of Brexit, and “in particular the decision” of the UK Government to opt for a hard Brexit.“An SPS agreement is necessary to reduce the current checks and those that would be otherwise requiredthe grace period ends without a permanent solution,” he stated.A spokesperson for DAERA said under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland is required to apply SPS checks on eligible goods entering the EU zone from GB, in line with those checks prescribed for Third Countries.

However, no progress has been made.A petition calling on the council to take action and restore Wilmont House to its former glory has been signed by more than  people so far.It was launched by local woman Sharon Marks, who said she had noticed the poor state of the building while taking walks in Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park during lockdown.“About a year ago, I contacted the council to see what the plans for the building were as it was gted to the council and the people of Belfast,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “For such a beautul building to fall into such a state of disrepair is just so sad. “The council said it was planning on carrying out an expression-of-interest exercise in early  to find someone to bring it back into use, but the pandemic has delayed this. “That really hacked me off, so I got in contact with local politicians to bring things forward, but that didn’t get very far.“One or two people in the council shouldn’t be gatekeepers of Wilmont House. “It was gted to the council and all the people of Belfast. People should be able to enjoy it.“It is such a beautul building and for that amount of heritage and history to be lost would be terrible.”Donal Lyons, a member of Belfast City Council’s growth and regeneration committee, agreed action should be taken.“There’s not many buildings like Wilmont House left in Belfast, let alone ones in such a setting, and we need to ensure that they are protected for future generations,” he said. “We’re lucky to have them. Each one of them captures a moment in the city’s history and everyone has their own personal stories in which these beautul buildings play a role. “We need to do more than just let them sit in decay.”A spokesperson for the council said: “Wilmont House at Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a Grade B-plus listed building owned by Belfast City Council. “We are in the process of preparing an invitation for expressions of interest to go to the market later this year, seeking a suitably qualied developer to restore the building and bring it into a new use.”Wilmont House, which dates back to , served as the headquarters of the US Army in Northern Ireland during the Second World War. It was later used as a nursing home and a parks office for the council. At one stage, it was also the headquarters of the Belfast Marathon. The petition calling on the council to restore Wilmont House can be found at change.orgRelated topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeBelfast councillors to discuss motion on free public transport for young peopleMost ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days East Belfast restaurant complains of ‘anti social behaviour’ following multiple cases of smashed windowsDUP councillor Audrey Wales’ spend on clothes during year as mayor causes further controversy‘Horric murder of Reavey brothers is story I was born to tell’: NI director on making a movie about death of his three uncles in Man found guilty of threatening to kill Jamie BrysonTop VideosBrian Smith appeared at Newtonards court on Tuesday.A north Belfast was todayconvicted of threatening to kill loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.Following a brief contest at Newtownards Magistrates Court, -year-old Brian Smith was also convicted of harassing Mr Bryson and making a threat that he would petrol bomb the homes of the victims mother and partner, all committed between July -

Can he deliver Brexit  I hope that he can,” said the businessman, who once donated to the campaign to leave the European Union.“I think he would make a good prime minister,” he added.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcd-baf-d-fd-dddeddd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcd-baf-d-fd-dddeddd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcd-baf-d-fd-dddeddd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_dfcd-baf-d-fd-dddeddd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin called Boris Johnson a ‘winner’ when he ran in the Conservative leadership race PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueWetherspoon founder Tim Martin called Boris Johnson a ‘winner’ when he ran in the Conservative leadership race But on Wednesday his company said it is “crazy” that pubs have to pay a higher level of VAT on alcohol sales than supermarkets do.It also launched a broadside against American investment giant BlackRock, a major investor in Wetherspoon.In November the investor used its shares to vote against the re-election of all Wetherspoon’s non-executive directors, saying there were shortfalls in corporate governance standards.On Wednesday the pub chain said: “Blackrock corporate governance executives, at the time of the AGMvote, had never met anyone from Wetherspoon – and there was no advance indication of their voting intention.”It added: “BlackRock itself infringes UK corporate governance guidelines, since its chairman is also CEO, and it does not appear to observe the ‘nine-year’ maximum tenure guideline for NEDs .” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

They are drawn from our century-and-half of operational work, and the lived experiences of those we work with today.We believe adopting these priorities will help to ensure people in crisis get the support they need no matter who or where they are.They are not only achievable, they are essential, and we urge all parties and candidates to incorporate them into their planning for the year ahead and beyond.A world where everyone gets the help they need in a crisis is within our reach onlywe choose it to be.l Sharon Sinclair is area director for British Red Cross, Northern IrelandThe publication British Red Cross Policy Priorities for the next Northern Ireland Executive is available on our website at: www.redcross.org.uk about-us what-we-do we-speak-up-for-change british-red-cross-policy-priorities-for-the-next-northern-ireland-executiveMore from the News Letter:Click here – VIDEO: Huge revamp of Belfast would create miles-long leafy avenue... turn Westlink into tunnel... and make city ‘blue again’ Click here – Wall of silence: Home Office suggests it is dangerous to tell public details about turning Carrickfergus hotel into base for foreign nationals Click here – Criminalising conversion therapy: Northern Ireland must avoid – not mimic – Canada’s new law says transgender writerA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And evenit was, the public could have misread such remarks as meaning they were in great danger, when it became apparent late last month that omicron was having a minor health impact. However, it is welcome to hear Dr Black now speak in a reassuring way, and admit that “our worst expectations haven’t been reached”. The covid crisis is not yet over – there have been too many twists and turns so far to be sure of any scenarios in the near future – but it is at a sufficiently mild level where we cannot tolerate the ruin of certain livelihoods and groups of people.Most society leaders — medical, scientic and political —who have demanded rigid controls are themselves financially untouched by lockdown because they are paid by the state.If lockdown does , the financial burden should be more evenly spread so that there is extra money for sectors such as hospitality. Politicians could show leadership by accepting voluntary pay cuts. But let us hope that it does not .We cannot keep planning for worst case scenarios of virus mutations.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

To help spread awareness of this, RNIB and  other charities from the sight loss sector have united to help make a dference by inviting people to ‘Take on ’ during the month of January.Mollie and Beth Gibson both have sight loss and have raised nearly £, for RNIB in just two weeksWhat they take on is completely up to them. People can conquer the virtual fundraiser by choosing any challenge inidually or as a team, and choosing any activity, whether it be baking, knitting, running, walking, singing or dancing and complete  minutes,  laps, or  hours of that activity.Beth, , and Mollie, , decided to sing for  minutes throughout January, initially aiming to raise £ through friends and family, but after their mum Lindsay posted twice daily videos of the girls singing on her Facebook page, the feedback was mind-blowing, and the donations started flooding in.The sisters have raised nearly £, and they are only half-way through January!Mum Lindsay, who works as a teacher in Banbridge school Bronte Primary, explained: “I didn’t even realise, but Mollie had been on the RNIB website after deciding she wanted to help raise money for them and she told me about the Take on  Challenge.“She was at a loss what to choose and I suggested singing. That’s all they do night and day anyway, they sing everything, so it made sense to do something they love.”Mollie and Beth attend Allegro School of Music where they practice musical theatre and Mollie, who attends Banbridge Academy, also sings in school.The videos have become such a hit with many logging onto Facebook daily just to hear the girls’ latest rendition.One supporter wrote on Lindsay’s video of Mollie singing classic Danny Boy: “I have goosebumps and a lump in my throat again fantastic Mollie and don’t forget family when you are famous.” Another wrote: “I am loving this little daily addition to my day,” while someone  commented: “Beautul brought tears to my eyes. Thank you so much.”Father Andrew, who is the minister in Banbridge and Donaghcloney Methodist Churches, accompanies the girls on the piano while mum Lindsay acts as videographer.Both parents are so proud of all the girls’ efforts, the reason they are doing it and of their eclectic mix of Christian hymns, folk and pop songs and Disney theme tunes, courtesy of Beth.Both Mollie and Beth were born with Albinism, a condition where they have less melanin than usual in their body. Melanin gives skin, hair, and eyes their colour and albinism is associated with vision problems.Mum Lindsay recalls: “When they were born, their diagnosis was something we weren’t expecting. While neither Andrew nor myself have the condition, but we are both carriers.“Very quickly we were put in touch with the right support networks and realised it was all manageable and so we took each day as it came.“The girls are great this is their normal and they manage really well. Without technology and the tools and aids they use in school, like iPads and magniers, things might be dferent, but they can manage. Technology has come so far and its le changing.”Mollie said: “We wanted to do this so RNIB could continue to help people who can’t see as well as everyone . We’ve really enjoyed the challenge so far and everyone has been so lovely with their comments and donations, we can’t believe how many people are watching!“It has been good fun and we’ve laughed lots!”The RNIB youth club runs in Banbridge and the girls joined four years ago when they moved to the area. “They both just love it,” said Lindsay, “Mollie, especially. Being with other young ones her own age who have sight conditions really gives her confidence.”The youth club had to take a temporary break due to the pandemic, but sessions took place virtually over Zoom and will hopefully resume in February.Donna McNicholl from RNIB’s Children, Young People and Families team, said: “The Banbridge youth club is a fun, vibrant and lively group of young people who meet up regularly to take part in a iety of interesting and exciting social activities which they choose and plan to do themselves. “We have great support from our parents and family members who volunteer and help with the preparation for activities such as arts and crafts, technology, science, cooking, sport and wellbeing activities to name but a few.“The Banbridge youth club is a fantastic opportunity for our young people with sight loss to meet, chat, laugh, learn and have a bit of fun. Our next online youth club will start on Friday th January, so come along and join in!” Anyone interested in attending the youth club can contact Donna on .Lindsay can’t believe the kindness of others and how people have responded to the girls fundraising appeal. She said: “People just keep donating! It shows the power of social media. We are very grateful to everyone, thank you.”Lizzi Wagner, senior challenge events manager at RNIB, said: “We’re excited to welcome back Take on  for ! The last two years have been a rollercoaster for everyone and particularly for blind and partially sighted people. So, let’s begin  with a fresh start.“If you’re up for a challenge, why not join us and Take on  to help raise funds for RNIB and provide support for the two million people living with sight loss.”If you are interested in in to the free virtual fundraiser, please visit: www.rnib.org.uk donations-and-fundraising challenge-events take--rnibYou can donate to Mollie and Beth’s JustGiving page by clicking here: https:www.justgiving fundraising Lindsay-Gibson utm_sourceSharethisutm_mediumfundraisingutm_contentLindsay-Gibsonutm_campaignpfp-emailutm_termedccbcdcddfbcdf"},{"url":null,"title":"do you have it to be a mastermind ","story":"Ashling Murphy: Tears as musicians play at vigil in Lurgan in memory of murdered teacher   New Carrickfergus ‘link’ road given green light by Mid and East Antrim CouncilNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsDo you have it to be a Mastermind Hat Trick Hindsight Productions are currently casting contestants for the next series of the BBC Two quiz show – Mastermind.By Darryl ArmitageWednesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Hat Trick Hindsight Productions are currently casting contestants for the next series of the BBC Two quiz show – MastermindThe quiz show will be celebrating its th year in production this year.Do you have what it takes to sit in the famous black chair Know enough about your specialist subject to be forensically tested How’s your general knowledge  Are you a pub quiz whizz What type of people are is the show looking for Entry is open to UK residentswho are aged  or over.You do need some general knowledge, but we’re really interested in your three specialist subjects – the wider the range the better.As well as regular quizzers, the show producers are also want to encourage people who might not usually apply for a quiz shows to get involved.Mastermind are looking to cast a erse range of people.

Contact Centres new premisesA centre which aims to facilitate contact between families is moving to a new venue in Carrickfergus town centre.By Helena McManusWednesday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Carrickfergus and Larne Child Contact Centres provides a safe, neutral, and comfortable place for children to see the parent they don’t live with, or sometimes other close family members.It was previously based in the YMCA building before relocating to new premises in nearby West Street, where it is hoped the service will be up and running next month.A registered charity, the centre provides a range of play activities for children aged -, with every family having the opportunity to enjoy safe contact time while being supported by highly trained and skilled volunteers.Volunteers from Carrickfergus and Larne Child Contact Centre pictured at their Christmas lunch in December .Shelly McCord, co-ordinator of the service said: “Our centre would not be able to run without the hard work and ongoing support of our team of volunteers. All volunteers receive regular training and are all vetted through Access NI to ensure their suitability to work with children and young people.“Families get involved in using our centre through the service of a solicitor, family court, or Social Services.”In Northern Ireland, contact centres utilise church halls and similar facilities to facilitate contact sessions. “During the pandemic, the Carrickfergus centre only closed for the first lockdown, and has managed to maintain direct contact for all of our families since June,” Shelly added. “During the lockdown period, indirect contact was maintained for families via our own Zoom facilities, enabling separated families to maintain much needed contact with each other.”Shelly is now hoping to expand the centre to bigger, better facilities, extending availability from limited hours to a six days a week service.The service is relocating to West Street in Carrickfergus town centre.Sensory room also for public useAdditionally, she envisaged the development of a ‘sensory room’, professionally designed and installed, free for public use for families with children who might benefit.Shelly and the centre’s chairperson, Tony Barclay, embarked upon a development project to identy potential costs, location and feasibility of the proposals. In October , whilst researching potential premises,  West Street was identied as a potential option. A former butcher’s shop, the unit had been completely redesigned as offices, a project which had stopped during the pandemic.The trustees of the charity agreed that the project should commence, and a lease for  West Street was signed. Within the centre, facilities are being developed to accommodate children of all ages from birth to  years, including an open play area for younger children a private, secluded room for older children, and – uniquely in any contact centre in NI – a professionally designed and installed sensory room, to be made available not only to service users of the contact centre, but also to other charities working with children who would benefit. The sensory room is also to be made publicly available to any family whose children would benefit from it, at no cost to the family.“We anticipate opening the centre and its facilities in February , once the full fit out is completed,” Shelly said.“We anticipate the sensory room will also open and become publicly available around the same time, bookable for -minute sessions for single families. A booking system is being developed for this purpose. “Our research has identied the existence of other sensory rooms in schools and other facilities across NI, but none which are available publicly – we believe this is the first.”Superb support from local communityThe Contact Centre is partly funded by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and partly by charitable grants.So far, staff have secured £, of funding specically towards the development of the sensory room, although another £, is needed to complete it, including lighting, soft flooring and soundproofing the walls.\"The local community, businesses and iniduals have been superb in supporting us as we move forward, including builders merchants providing materials, the local community coming together to provide equipment, and iniduals providing their own support,\" Shelly continued.\"We have been especially blessed in the form of local resident and businessman Gary Connolly, who has provided a great deal of time and personal effort to build the walls within the new centre, including the Sensory Room, free of charge to us.\"In order to complete the new centre, we need to raise more funds, and furnish the centre with equipment suitable for the families we support. As a registered charity, we provide all of ourservices free of charge to our service users. As well as needing to raise £, to complete the sensory room, we need durable flooring, baby change facilities, accessible toilet handles emergency call system, fire extinguishers, a secure door access system, a small CCTV system, and more.\"We greatly appreciate all the help the local community has offered, as well as the support from the Law Society of NI, who have fully endorsed and are supporting the development of the new centre, which will offer so much to the local community – and possibly much further afield.\"Meanwhile, waiting times for access to a contact centre will be reduced, and possibly even eliminated, with the planned six day opening. \"Families with special needs, including wheelchairusers and those with sensitive children of all ages, will have the opportunity to access a centre designed to meet those needs.\"The fit out of the new premises is already underway. There is still much to do in order to be ready for opening day in February. The charity welcome any and all support, in terms of funding to help us achieve our goals including the sensory room, to provide furniture and toys for all ages from - , and to finish the fit out.\"Shelly McCord can be contacted by email at [email#protected], or by phone at  , while Tony Barclay can be contacted at [email#protected] or by phone at  .CarrickfergusWest StreetNorthern IrelandYMCA  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularNew Carrickfergus ‘link’ road given green light by Mid and E...NewsJaguar E-Pace stolen from Portadown home...News arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in Newtownabbey\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-as-police-investigate-a-series-of-burglaries-in-newtownabbey- itm_sourceparsely-api\" arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in Newtownabbey\" \"\" width\"\" arrested as police investigate a series of burglaries in Newtownabbey\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-as-police-investigate-a-series-of-burglaries-in-newtownabbey- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Manarrested as police investigate a series of burglari...News attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime teenage-boy--attacked-by-gang-in-craigavon-co-armagh- itm_sourceparsely-api\" attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" \"\" width\"\" attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime teenage-boy--attacked-by-gang-in-craigavon-co-armagh- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Teenage boyattacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh...NewsMan due in court after cocaine seized in Newtownabbey...NewsMost PopularSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedBest pancake pans UK: from non-stick to cast iron, these pan...RecommendedHome exercise gear that works: weighted hula-hoops, bala ban...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?164206751200","title":"take part in this year s big garden birdwatch ","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.
