Foreign ministers from Arab and Muslim countries held preparatory talks on the eve of the summitsThe vessels were attacked using \u0027naval mines almost certainly from Iran\u0027, Bolton told a news conference in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.Iran rejected the accusation, calling it \u0027laughable\u0027.US experts are part of a five-nation team investigating the ship attacks.Stepping up the war of words on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Iran was trying to raise global energy prices through the attacks on oil installations.The US has beefed up its military presence in the region, with the deployment of an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers and 1,500 additional troops.Bolton however said the extra US forces were sent to the Middle East as a \u0027deterrent\u0027 and that Washington\u0027s response would be prudent.\u0027We definitely desire a change in the (Iranian) regime\u0027s behaviour,\u0027 Brian Hook, US Special Representative for Iran, said Thursday.Regional tensions have grown since US President Donald Trump\u0027s administration reimposed sanctions against Iran after Washington unilaterally pulled out of a multilateral 2015 nuclear accord signed with the Islamic republic.But Trump appeared to soften his hawkish tone towards Tehran, saying during a visit to Japan on Monday that his government does not seek \u0027regime change\u0027.Through the summits, Saudi Arabia has sought to project a unified Arab front against Tehran in the face of bitter differences with neighbouring Qatar.Qatar was represented at Friday\u0027s meetings by Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser al-Thani, Doha\u0027s highest-ranking official to visit the kingdom since the start of a two-year-old Saudi-led boycott.       Through the summits, Saudi Arabia has sought to project a unified Arab front against Tehran in the face of bitter differences with neighbouring QatarAppearing tense, the Qatari official shook hands with the Saudi king but there was no indication of a thaw.Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have enforced the economic and diplomatic boycott of Qatar since June 2017, including bans on shipping, trade, direct flights, overflight and land crossings.The alliance accuses Doha of supporting Islamist movements and backing Iran -- claims Qatar rejects.The summits coincide with the last few days of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, when Mecca throngs with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims.The meetings take place at night, as Muslims break their day-long fasting at sunset and then go into several hours of special prayers known as Taraweeh."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/29/01/14079078-0-image-m-48_1559089752095.jpg","title":"Glen parachuting dog join heroic handler Emile Corteil Normandy","story":"Share this article Walk through the stunning Commonwealth cemetery at Ranville, where 2,400 men lie buried, and there is one grave which always stops visitors in their tracks. It is that of 19-year-old Private Emile Corteil from Watford, who was killed during the first phase of D-Day.His headstone is engraved with a particularly poignant inscription, chosen by Emile’s heartbroken mother, Jessie: ‘Had you known our boy you would have loved him too. “Glen” his paratroop dog was killed with him.’         Emile Corteil and dog Glen, pictured. Both completed their parachute descent on D-Day but Emile was killed later that day and Glen died at his side         Next week, veterans and world leaders will gather at dawn on the 75th anniversary of D-Day to inaugurate the memorial at the very spot where tens of thousands of British troops came ashore in 1944         In a move that has been warmly welcomed by veterans, a designated area of the new 50-acre Normandy Memorial site will be dedicated to the animals killed in action that summer. (Pictured) Royal Marine Commandos move off Normandy beaches during an inland advanceWhat the inscription does not reveal – for it was a serious breach of military rules – is that Glen is actually in the same grave.So it would have been rather unfair if Emile were to be included on the new memorial with no reference of any sort to the gallant Glen. As a result, the trustees for the memorial – who include the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt – have agreed that Glen should be acknowledged on a memorial stone in the wildflower meadow alongside the main memorial.‘Long-term, the trust wishes to recognise the sacrifice of all animals taken in to battle with the British Forces,’ says a spokesman.The news has gone down well with the veterans. ‘It’s entirely right that there’s a separate memorial for the animals lost in Normandy,’ says Tony Rampling, 93, who landed on Gold Beach with the Reconnaissance Regiment. ‘The sacrifice was huge.’He is still troubled by the memory of his own painful attempt to despatch a badly wounded horse, using his Sten gun, at a crossroads near Falaise.Glen’s inclusion will certainly please the veterans of the Parachute Regiment who suffered heavy losses defending the eastern flank of the invasion, following the capture of Pegasus Bridge.

Two Horsa gliders that brought the \u0027coup de main\u0027 force in on the night of D-Day can be seen in the background         Until now, Britain has had no national memorial in Normandy. (Pictured) Juno beach in Normandy where allied forces landed on D-Day.‘Paradogs’ were inseparable from their handlers. Though they would jump separately – in the same harness used for dropping bicylces – they were even trained to spread themselves across the parachute on landing to prevent it blowing away.On being released, their roles would include flushing out the enemy, sniffing out mines and unexploded ordnance, finding wounded soldiers and carrying messages. They were also a huge boost to morale.Emile and Glen were with a group of soldiers from 9 Para who had been dropped off-course in the middle of the night and were attempting to regroup with their unit for the famous attack on the Merville Battery on the morning of D-Day. Tragically, an RAF patrol mistook them for Germans. The bodies of Emile and Glen were later found together in a bomb crater, Emile still holding Glen by the lead.They were taken for burial in Ranville where there was touching twist to the story. According to Mark Worthington, curator of Normandy’s Pegasus Memorial Museum, a furious row broke out. ‘Emile was being buried by his comrade, Gordon Newton of 9 Para. Gordon himself later told me what happened next,’ says Mr Worthington.The man in charge of the burial party was adamant that Glen was not to be interred. ‘This officer gave the order that the dog was not to be buried with his master,’ Mr Worthington explains. ‘At which point Gordon replied, “He’s either going in with his master – or you’re going in with him”.

Ian Cumming, chief executive of Health Education England, said that people are currently not told about the discrepancies. But in the next 10 years this may changeIt also found that those who conceive younger, live in deprivation, or are in long term relationships - rather than marriages, or in certain cultural groups - were at a higher risk of having a child with paternal discrepancy.At the time the study warned that increasing paternity testing and use of DNA techniques in clinical and judicial procedures meant more cases were likely to be identified.The issue was raised during a discussion about long-term changes the NHS must make to keep up with a changing society.Professor Cumming said one thing that needed to be considered was the increasing demand for and ability to carry out whole genome sequencing.While it allows the ability to warn people they have a genetically increased risk of developing certain illness, such as breast cancer, it also raises moral questions about when and whether to tell patients.He explained: ‘Within the next 10 years we will probably be whole genome sequencing 100 per cent of the population who wish to be sequenced.‘That will start giving us all sorts of information about probability of people developing particular conditions, particular diseases.‘It will allow us to predict when they may happen. It may in cases allow preventative actions to be taken.‘Certainly it will allow iniduals to be kept a closer eye on.‘But it is not without controversy, if we are able to predict someone has an increased chance of developing breast cancer when do you tell them?‘Do you tell their parents when they’re born? Do you tell them when they’re 12, 14, 16, 18?‘Do people want to know? There’s a whole host of complexity around the ethics of this.’The NHS may carry out genetic tests to diagnose a condition, establish whether someone is likely to develop one or determine if they carry a genetic mutation. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kayaker pulls cool backflip three metre drop celebrates somersault","story":" Bennett has been kayaking since 2010 and now has six years as a professional whitewater kayaker under his belt.The footage shows 23-year-old calmly test the waters and look down the quick drop of the dam, before he builds up momentum to make the flip over.As if practised to perfection he flips himself over and makes the short slide down into the river.

Some argue we should have a second referendum. Others, a general election. Some even suggest revoking Article 50. Well, in the words of a great British Prime Minister who knew how to get what she wanted from the European Commission: No, no, no.         \u0027Three years later – and after local, national and European elections in which too many good, honest Conservatives have been voted out of office – the British people\u0027s frustration and the need to make good on the referendum result have never been greater\u0027, writes Mr Javid         \u0027Some even suggest revoking Article 50. Well, in the words of a great British Prime Minister who knew how to get what she wanted from the European Commission: No, no, no\u0027, writes Sajid Javid, quoting Margaret ThatcherThe voters have been asked their opinion more than enough times. Never in this country\u0027s history have we asked people to go to the polls a second time without implementing their verdict from the first. Another vote before we leave would be disastrous for trust in politics, and cause the kind of chaos that risks handing Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-left supporters the keys to No 10.Second – we need to prepare fully for No Deal. This isn\u0027t because I want it. But we have to accept the reality of our situation.The EU\u0027s insistence that negotiations happen under a ticking clock mean, come October 31, that is what we face if we don\u0027t have a deal.As Prime Minister I would immediately step up No Deal preparations. We would aim to keep the impacts to a minimum. But, while too much apocalyptic language has been used, we have to be honest. It wouldn\u0027t be painless. So, as part of preparations we would have a broad, bold No Deal Budget ready.          \u0027We need to prepare fully for No Deal. This isn\u0027t because I want it. But we have to accept the reality of our situation\u0027, writes the Home SecretaryThis would also show the EU we are ready – so when we turn up to negotiate, they know we are not afraid of walking out.Third – we must focus on what we need to get a deal which can be agreed. That means accepting the realities of the parliamentary arithmetic, and what is practically possible.We know the only thing that has got through our Parliament successfully is the Withdrawal Agreement with backstop provisions amended to include a time limit or exit clause. So, fourth – I would work directly with Ireland so we can amend the backstop. The backstop is important to the EU because it is important to Ireland. So that\u0027s where our efforts need to focus.And there\u0027s something big in our favour. We both want the same thing – as now, an invisible and frictionless border.What\u0027s currently missing is trust in our ability and determination to deliver that. That requires two things. Someone who could work with them constructively building a strong relationship of personal trust. And a credible solution.I\u0027ve looked at this in the Home Office, tasking a team from Border Force to look at what we\u0027d need in place.          Mr Javid (pictured with his wife Laura) believes that a revised deal needs to be put before ParliamentThey were clear the technologies already exist to avoid a hard border, and important work in being undertaken by the Alternative Arrangement Commission on this front. What we need is the trust and will on both sides to make this work a reality.Of course, some will say this isn\u0027t possible. I understand that caution. But in practice this is a feasible plan. And I think we will see more engagement as a new Commission takes place and we get closer to October.Others will ask why Ireland should pay for the consequences of the UK\u0027s decision to leave. That\u0027s a fair point, so as Prime Minister I would agree to cover the cost to Ireland of delivering this. It\u0027s a small price to avoid No Deal – and the risks that would bring to the hard-won peace.Fifth – we\u0027ll need to take this revised deal though Parliament. There is no getting around the fact that the timing for negotiations and then getting legislation through will be challenging. But I would take every step possible to ensure we leave with a deal by October 31.This is an honest, realistic plan to get a deal through. I have to be straight – delivering it won\u0027t be easy. But if we succeed – and I believe we will – then this is the path that will lead our great country to a still greater future.As Prime Minister I would have a clear position. We should leave on October 31. And if we cannot get a deal we should, with great regret, leave without one, having done everything we can to minimise disruption.Of course, the arithmetic of a minority government is inescapable. As the recent comments of the Speaker demonstrated, it\u0027s simply not credible to promise you can deliver a No Deal if Parliament is set against it. And anyone who promised this would risk driving us to a pre-Brexit general election this year. A disaster first and foremost for our country and public trust in democracy, but also for our party.That\u0027s why we need a leader who can unite the party, and country, behind a credible plan – and then go and actually deliver it.I believe this is that plan.And I know I am that leader. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/25/14/6616864-0-image-a-26_1543156270764.jpg","title":"Joan Bakewell 86 refuses condemn elderly drinkers asked present topic","story":"Share this article The Labour peer explained: ‘I was invited to do a Panorama programme about the fact older people were drinking too much, would I present it?

In the 2017 General Election, hard-line Tory Brexiteer Stewart Jackson lost, after 12 years in the constituency, by just 607 votes to Labour’s Onasanya.Her tawdry behaviour and ‘sacking’ by the voters here earlier this year mean all eyes are now on Peterborough. For what they decide here on Thursday could be reflected in a future General Election.Certainly, readers of the local newspaper have decreed by a huge margin in a poll that Brexit, rather than immigration, is the biggest issue in this by-election. The poll does not reveal, however, whether Remainers or Leavers have the upper hand.What is indisputable is that the parties of old — Tory and Labour — are worried that Farage’s upstarts or even ardent Remainers voting for the Liberal Democrats will outshine them next week. This is despite the 2016 referendum result which saw Peterborough vote solidly 61 per cent in favour of leaving Europe.Few know better about how the land lies than the vicar of Peterborough, 56-year-old Canon Ian Black, who on Tuesday night, ran a hustings event at his church. He invited eight of the Parliamentary candidates standing next week to speak, and hundreds of local people questioned them.He admits that there were not many ‘Asian or black’ people in the audience. Nor, he says, did he hear a lot of strong foreign accents, an indication perhaps that recent arrivals had not put in an appearance.But he resents the claim, made by some in Peterborough I spoke to, that the people who attended the hustings were ‘all white and all old’ or even ‘racists’ who would automatically support Brexit.         Certainly, readers of the local newspaper have decreed by a huge margin in a poll that Brexit, rather than immigration, is the biggest issue in this by-election          Here, Italian, Portuguese, Iraqi, Turkish, Polish, Lithuanian, Albanian, Kosovan, Afghan, Indian and Afro-Caribbean takeaways, barbers, and coffee bars stand along the pavements one after anotherAt the event, the Brexit Party hopeful Mr Greene ridiculed the main parties for drawing up manifesto policies for Peterborough they then spectacularly failed to deliver. ‘They might as well have been written on toilet paper,’ he told the audience, to cheers.Afterwards Canon Black said of the hustings: ‘There was no clear winning side. If I were to guess, the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party did well. But the Brexit candidate, Mike Greene had no manifesto policies on education, climate challenges or social issues, for instance. He only talked about getting out of Europe’.Peterborough has its problems. There is homelessness, worries that the local schools are not up to scratch, a desire for a university to bring in the young skilled, and a sense that the city has not got a fair share of Government money. On the other hand, it has a respectable employment rate, good rail links, prospering light industry with the third-fastest growing local economy in the UK.As Lib Dem campaigner Nick Sandford told the Mail: ‘There are more pluses than minuses’.Whatever the truth, the by-election fight is shaping up to be dirty. In the gardens surrounding the Conservative campaign headquarters in Dogsthorpe Road, red Labour Party posters have been erected on wooden signs. When I asked a young man at Tory HQ if this was a case of dirty tricks, he answered: ‘Inevitably’.I knocked on the door of one neighbour to ask how such a poster had turned up in her garden opposite the Tory HQ. A smiling 37-year-old Nazia Kausar, wife of a taxi driver and mother of three, said: ‘A man came round yesterday who I had never seen before. He asked if he could put it there. I am going to vote Labour so I let him.’Meanwhile, Labour is targeting the Brexit Party, too. An email to members in the region pleads: ‘In Peterborough we are in for the fight of our lives. The Brexit Party is doing well. And if we don’t do something, they could get their first MP.’Labour’s fears became even clearer when it ran an advertisement attacking Farage’s party on Thursday in the Peterborough Telegraph. The ad was deliberately produced to confuse voters (some of whom may have limited English) on a Brexit-turquoise background with the headline: ‘Here’s what you need to know about the Brexit Party: No plans to tackle crime, no idea how to fix the broken school system, no policies to clean streets.’ Before it went to print, however, the newspaper, out of courtesy, let the Brexit Party know what its rival was up to.Within an hour, the Farage machine produced a slick one of its own in socialist red saying: ‘Here’s what you want to know about the Labour Party …. the last Labour MP for Peterborough (Fiona Onasanya) cast the decisive vote to block Brexit in Parliament.’All this may look like small beer, local skulduggery and far removed from the Westminster bubble. But things are getting heated because the upcoming result is so important to all parties and may hint at the UK’s future political path.In the hunt for potential Lib Dem voters, I found myself close to the cathedral at the smart home of theologian Dr Natalie Watson, a British citizen but who hails originally from Germany.She attended the vicar’s hustings and said: ‘I’ve always voted Labour, but the only way to get us out of this mess is go with the Lib Dems.‘People here are uninformed about Brexit. They support it because they think immigrants are taking their jobs, but there is work here for anyone if they go for it.’The owner of the Spar supermarket near the cathedral agrees. He is debonair Sanjay Khunti, 43. Born in Peterborough, and of Ugandan Asian heritage, he speaks with a cut-glass accent and jokes that he has had elocution lessons.A disillusioned Tory, his message is clear that the Lib Dems ‘may sneak in here’. He says Peterborough is ‘an absolute dump’ with poverty rife. People are so poor they think twice about buying even a multi-pack of crisps.How, he wonders, will Nigel Farage’s party help them when their candidate Mr Greene makes no mention of how he would solve the city’s woes?At the Brexit Party campaign headquarters close to the cathedral, you appreciate his point. Holding court is multi-millionaire property tycoon Richard Tice, 54.Last week he won a seat in the European Parliament for the East of England.Public-school educated and dressed in an expensive-looking suit, he is eloquent, confident and surrounded by acolytes — devoted Brexiteer men and women in their 50s and older — who clap him furiously as he talks about his party’s campaign.Back in Lincoln Road, at a cafe bar, I talk to Janet Tobolik, who is 65 and half Polish. A devout Eurosceptic, she says only one party cares about Peterborough’s problems. She is voting UKIP.‘There is rubbish on the streets. This is my country and you suddenly find a settee in the middle of the road. Peterborough is a slum. They drop everything these immigrants.’Down the street, a 73-year-old man who called himself Mr Dhillon, said: ‘I have lived here since 1967. I always supported Labour.

Her father was the first Orkney man to have been killed in the Great War. Her little farm was a clutter of buildings marooned in fields of cows. The sandstone was patterned with lichen and pitted with years of weathering.On the main building, two bright steel buckets hung, either side of the door, full of rainwater from the guttering. This was the only running water that the house possessed, and much more convenient than hauling up buckets from the well.Stepping through the doorway was like walking through a wardrobe into Narnia. The kitchen was virtually bare, with the exception of a black-leaded range cooker set in a wall of blue and cream tiles.Peat burned in the grate and the room was smoky with the scent of burning heather. The only light filtered through two tiny windows. A heavy porcelain sink with no taps hung beneath one of the windows. A single plate, cup and spoon were drying on the wooden draining board.There was no fridge, no washing machine, no appliances of any kind . . . because there was no electricity.A small voice answered my calls, but it took me a moment to realise that it came from behind a brocaded curtain next to the range. Pulling this back, I discovered a recess with a box bed and, peering warily at me from under layers of covers, a tiny woman with her face and arms dyed oily brown from a lifetime of working with peat.She told me her back was bad. Reaching into the recess I tried to examine her, but it was almost impossible to get near enough.Eventually, I climbed over the wooden threshold into the bed itself and knelt on the sea of blankets. ‘I was born in this bed,’ she told me. ‘My father was the blacksmith on this farm, and I’ve never lived anywhere else.’Clambering out, I gave her some strong painkillers and turned to go. On an oval table under a window I noticed a Tilley lamp, and remarked that I had just acquired one.‘I know,’ retorted Ina. ‘It was Nessie’s father’s old one, and she had no use for it.’ With that she disappeared under the blankets.How did a bedridden woman who lived alone in a farmhouse surrounded by cows know what an equally elderly woman had given to me as a welcome gift only the day before?I’ve come to accept that on Eday, everybody knows everything as soon as it happens.Certainly the seal rescue centre had heard all about my latest patient by the time I placed it in an improvised hospital bed in the shed next to our house, wrapped in a blanket and warmed by a 200-watt light bulb. Its thick, bristly whiskers were twitching with fear and its snout was dripping with mucus, what we used to call a ‘snottery beak’ when I was a schoolboy in the Scottish Borders.A vet at the centre tells me over the phone the pup probably has a distemper virus or ‘seal flu’ and asks me to take its temperature. As I ponder how to stick a glass rod up a seal’s bottom, the voice at the other end of the line is issuing urgent instructions on how to make sure the animal doesn’t get dehydrated — by feeding fluids through a tube.‘The best medicine is herring broth,’ says the vet. ‘You need four or five herring made into a watery soup, perhaps with a little oatmeal, and feed it around a pint and a half every four hours. Through the night. You’re doing a grand job, Doc.’I set my alarm for midnight, 4am and 8am, to administer herring broth. My chief memory of that night is standing over a hissing seal pup, half-dressed by the orange light of a storm lantern, in a shed, while a gale blows outside and my wife stares steadily at me with an eyebrow raised.She doesn’t need to say anything to make her views clear. We reach silent agreement that we’re completely bonkers and carry on.Next day, to our relief, we were able to hand the pup over to the seal rescue centre.But it didn’t take long for word to get around that my medical training could be put to use for animals, and I got a phone call from a farmer who wondered if it wouldn’t be too much trouble for me to nip over and do a caesarean section on a cow.He was serious: calling the vet from the mainland might cost more than the combined value of the cow and her unborn calf. When an animal gets into difficulties during birth, the only economical solution is sometimes to shoot the poor beast. I understood his dilemma, but the answer was still ‘no’.That was far from the strangest request I’ve had . . . and some simply couldn’t be refused. Soon after my visit to bedridden Ina, I had a call from her friend Jenny: would I mind coming out to see her husband Tom, who was ‘going down with one of his colds’ — and while I was there, she had another matter to discuss.Neither Jenny nor Tom was more than 5ft tall and, standing in their bedroom crammed with Fifties curios and ornaments was like finding myself in a doll’s house furnished by an elderly kleptomaniac. There was nothing very much wrong with Tom that his asthma inhaler wouldn’t cure, which made me slightly concerned about the ‘other matter’. And I was right to be.‘Nessie and Ina were pleased with the way you looked after them,’ Jenny declares. ‘And Ann the Post says your boys are right polite when they come into the shop for their comics.‘I’m glad to see you’re in church of a Sunday, aren’t you? Good, so that’s settled. Our minister is going to be away for a while, so you can lead the services from now on, you being educated and all that.’And that’s it. The ‘other matter’ is settled. From now on, I’m reading the sermon. I won’t have to write it, thank goodness, because medical training might stretch to seals, but it certainly doesn’t cover theology.A sermon will be sent each week for me to read aloud. As I leave Jenny’s little house, it occurs to me that I and my family have been vetted and approved by the community without ever being aware this was happening.The following Sunday, I lead worship in the large, stone-grey church on the hillside, with its golden-brown lacquered doors and its eight enormous plain glass windows, shining down on row after row of polished cedar pews.There is seating for at least 300 parishioners: when the church was built, there were more than 600 islanders, five times as many as today.I check with Tommy, the organist, that he has the right hymns, and he explains that a field mouse has chewed a hole in the bellows. The air leak means he must pump much harder when he plays. This worries me, since Tommy suffers from angina, but he has the solution: a glyceryl trinitrate tablet, which he sucks between hymns.He can’t swallow a whole one, he adds cheerfully, because they give him a headache. I can’t scold him: I prescribed the tablets, after all.In the pulpit, I unfold the sermon sent from the mainland and begin to read: ‘Verily, I say unto thee, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me . . .’ Oh dear. I read on: ‘For where thou must aspire to dwell with the seraphim . . .’It appears the author of the sermon was born in 1853. But I’m stuck with these words, and nobody seems to object.As the nights got colder, ice on the roads became a problem. Cars started to slide onto verges, especially after I attended one minor accident and gave the occupants of the car a lift home.There was a danger this could become a habit, until I had a brainwave: I let it be known that from then on I would be billing the driver’s insurance company for my call-out fee, and that furthermore I was duty-bound to report all accidents to the police.There were no more cars stranded on verges.I doubt I’d have had much luck with the insurers. On my rounds one morning in January, I noticed there was no traffic on the roads. When I pulled in at the pump to fill up with fuel, I noticed two men standing by the kiosk, their chequered police hats just visible.I asked at the shop whether the police were the reason the roads were clear. ‘Aye, it’s not long before word gets around that they’re here to check the road tax and insurance. We didn’t tell you, with you being official and all. We knew your car would be fine, Doc.’ That was a double-edged compliment. I was not yet ‘one of us’.But I was becoming more part of the community all the time, especially after Maggie developed complications during her pregnancy with our fifth child and had to spend six weeks in hospital on the mainland before the birth — leaving me to look after four lively boys. When we brought Megan home, she was truly an Eday baby and we were an Eday family.One of the ways this became apparent was in the system of barter that covered the prescription charge. For some, this was difficult to pay, so I started paying their fees myself. In return, plastic bags appeared, hanging on the kitchen door: three cabbages at the lower end of the scale, fresh lobster at the upper end. The system worked so well the boys soon expected lobster for tea.I chose not to go into the pulpit for the Christmas Eve service after Megan arrived. She was asleep in my arms, and I was afraid I’d wake her if I read aloud. A sleeping baby takes precedence over everything at a Christmas service, naturally.Afterwards, a triumphant Jenny served hot drinks and home-made mince pies, kept hot on the strategically placed paraffin stoves. There was enough for all 50 folk who came.As they melted into the night, the sky behind the little church cleared of cloud. A deep velvet blackness fell, touching the sea. Blackness broken not by starlight but clothed in ribbons of luminous green and yellow light streaming across the horizon, and the air came alive with the shimmering tingle of sound.Many people have seen the Merry Dancers — the Northern Lights — some not knowing what they are. Few, very few, have heard the electric beat of the solar winds.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3911276.1559340079!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in s rise hid party divisions but its descent may bring them to the fore","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald: her leadership is not yet being questioned. But a poor general election could change that.Those present at the weekly Sinn Féin team meeting in Leinster House on Tuesday traded their initial accounts of what went wrong.But this was not the forum for a full postmortem of the local and European elections. There will be a review, as there is after every election, but it will be structured and thorough.It will also be a brutal assessment of how the party got to this point: down from 159 council seats to 81, a loss of probably two MEPs and a drop from 15 per cent to 10 per cent of the local elections vote in five years.In 2014, Sinn Féin rode a tide of anger over the economic crisis, but some in the party were uncomfortable with a surge that was not typical of its incremental growth and were fearful it was built on sand.In 2019 low turnout in working class areas – attributed to the lack of a central campaign issue – and boundary changes contributed to the Sinn Féin collapse.Larger council wards, where Sinn Féin won the seventh and eight seats five years ago, were reduced in size. What propelled the surge worsened the fall.Yet the conversations taking place across the party, with many still in shock at the size of the losses, are more fundamental in nature.“If we had realised a problem on the doors we would have taken remedial action,” said a TD. “We are not just dealing with the election result, we are dealing with the fact that we weren’t prepared for it.”LessonsThe presidential election, when Liadh ni Ríada polled 6 per cent, led to some self-examination. Local elections, and the lessons from them, are much more important.“If the country has changed, if the mood has improved, should we not have calibrated sooner to it?” asked one figure. “People are saying we were too angry. Were we solution-based enough?”There are members who want to be more liberal on social issues and those who think Sinn Féin is preoccupied with same-sex marriage and abortion people who think it is too keen to share power with Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin, and people who think Sinn Féin isn’t seen as party of government those who think it should tack further to the left and those who think it should go towards the centre.Sinn Féin’s rise hid such isions, but its descent may bring them to the fore.“It’s a bit like when the tide goes out and you see all the shells, and all the problems, and that is where we are now,” said a source.Decisions to repeatedly table Dáil motions of no confidence, the treatment of councillors – although the party denies it has a culture of bullying – and Mary Lou McDonald’s missteps, such as posing behind an “England - Get out of Ireland” banner, are all now on the slab.Messaging is emerging as one of the main issues, and not just the Dáil tone of McDonald or Pearse Doherty, but the way all Sinn Féin TDs communicate. One well placed source said the strength of argument from a Sinn Féin TD on television or radio “might win the point but lose the voter”.Manner of deliveryThe content of the message is unlikely to change, even if the manner of delivery is softened.“Our position on carbon tax is correct,” said another source, claiming it would mean higher heating bills. “There are still 4,000 kids in emergency accommodation.”One TD said the Dáil approach was based on principle. “We don’t just go in and say ‘you are all a shower of bastards.’ It is because we would do it differently.”Sinn Féin is constructive when it needs to be, supporting some Government initiatives and operating on a cross-party basis, the Deputy argued. This needs to be communicated to the public.The “hypocrisy” of others in calling for Sinn Féin to enter government in Northern Ireland with the DUP while refusing to do business with McDonald in Dublin, also needs to be challenged more than it is now.Other, internal matters are also exercising some, such as how the press office, TDs’ offices and McDonald’s office operate.McDonald has had two poor election outings, and is not being pardoned for mistakes as Gerry Adams was.“Even when he did really cock up, people would say: ‘yeah, but that’s Gerry Adams.’ Gerry was iconic,” said a party veteran. “That day is gone.”McDonald’s leadership, while being tested, is not yet being questioned. But a poor general election could change that.“We are the same as any other political party,” said a source. “If we had another meltdown then questions would be asked.”Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of Justice11 dead as gunman opens fire in Virginia Beach in latest US mass shootingTaxman lauches crackdown as number of phone scams rockets from 7,800 to more than 100,000 a yearDonald Trump backs Boris Johnson to be the next Prime MinisterObesity has become \u0026#39the new smoking\u0026#39 and will fuel weight-related cancers, head of NHS warnsGCHQ warns over Google and Mozilla plans for encrypted browsers Elton John condemns removal of homosexual scenes from his biopic Rocketman in RussiaComment: The intellectually barren Tories are losing the battle of ideas against the LeftDavid Cameron uses memoirs to settle scores with \u0026#39backstabbing\u0026#39 Michael GoveBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2019, live semi-final 5, recap: no bloopers or storm-offs, just a reasonable amount of talentOne person in 10 is mistaken about the identity of their father, reveals NHS chiefSajid Javid reveals he is prepared to take Britain out of EU without a dealCashless Britain revealed: Councils, bus services and shops are banning coins and notesScanners developed to search the Universe for stars could slash queues at airport securityHaunting picture of Budapest boat at the bottom of the Danube as search for the 21 missing continuesFarmers welcome documents showing sea eagles do kill healthy lambsComment: Our ruling elite is destroying itself with grief over the death of BlairismBirmingham pub bombing families to receive less in legal aid than coroner spent on PR teamComment: My advice to the next Tory leader is this – ditch the deal, and pursue a free trade agreement to unite our partyBirmingham City Council wins High Court injunction to stop protests against LGBT teaching at schoolBrexit Party candidate Mike Greene not fazed by Boris Johnson and Gordon Brown on campaign trailParis court finds Briton Ian Bailey guilty in Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder caseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

pub bombing families receive less legal aid coroner","story":"Julie Hambleton (2L), Michelle Sealey (L) and Paul Bridgewater (R), whose father Paul Davies was also among those killed, gather with other relatives of the victims at the inquest. The families of the Birmingham pub bombing victims will receive less in legal aid for their four-decade fight for justice than the coroner spent on a PR team, it has emerged.As part of a £3.6million spend which included barristers and solicitors, the coroner\u0027s team spent £200,000 on PR consultancy firm Crest Advisory, a Freedom of Information request has revealed.It is understood that the families, who were forced to fight to get any legal aid whatsoever, will receive a “tiny fraction” of that - less than was spent on the media team.Julie Hambleton, whose elder sister Maxine was killed in the 1974 attacks, said: “It is outrageous. There is no equality of arms.”The costs do not include the money spent by other public bodies which were legally represented at the inquest, including West Midlands Police.The inquest in front of Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC, which ended in April, concluded that the 21 victims had been unlawfully killed and a botched warning by the Provisional IRA had caused or contributed to their murders.A policeman standing outside the Mulberry Bush after the explosion in Birmingham City centreThe families are now demanding that the police prosecute the suspects, who were named during the hearings. Nobody has ever been brought to justice for the murders.The FOI answered by the solicitor to the inquest reveals that £1,427,180.63 was charged by Fieldfisher Solicitors to advise the inquest, £869,583.47 was charged by four barristers and a total of £1,338,062.41 was spent on other costs including travel and hotels.In addition £202,139.01 was paid to Crest Advisory “to provide press officers to the inquests from July 2017” and upload documents.Ten of the victim’s families were represented by the firm KRW LAW LLP, which acted pro bono for four years before the families won their legal aid battle in September 2018.  Their fees, which have not been revealed, are subject to final assessment by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) in a process which could take six months. It will be less than 10 per cent of the coroner’s total, the  understands.Ms Hambleton said: “I was appalled when I saw these figures.“There appears to be no accountability for this expenditure – no tendering process for legal services, no overview of accounting, no justification for PR firm (which from our point of view was employed to brief against the relatives).” “What we wanted – and what many others forced into the coronial process want –is parity and equality of arms.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with the families of those who died during this horrific attack.“Legal aid is available for inquests in exceptional cases, which is why we funded the families throughout this inquest.“While our review of legal aid showed that legal representation is not necessary for the vast majority of inquests, we are making a number of changes to ensure there’s more support for bereaved families.”11 dead as gunman opens fire in Virginia Beach in latest US mass

headquarters staff underground bunkers given light therapy","story":"Marie Scott, photographed in front of the map wall in Southwick House, General Eisenhower\u0026#39s headquarters, from where D Day was commanded. Defence and Security CorrespondentBritain’s wartime switchboard operators were given light therapy as commanders feared they were missing out on Vitamin D while working underground, a D-Day hero has revealed.Military staff in underground headquarters had to work for so long without access to natural light that they had mandatory sunlamp treatment.The women had to strip to the waist and wear specially designed goggles to protect their eyes from the radiation during their sessions.Marie Scott, 92, worked as a switchboard operator at Southwick Park, the underground headquarters based in the cliffs outside Portsmouth from where the D-Day landings were monitored.Aged 17 she worked eight-hour watches over a day-long duty. She and her colleagues were able to rest on three-tier bunks in small, cramped rooms with no natural light.The conditions were “not terribly pleasant,” she told the . “There were no oranges, or fruit juice - we didn’t have that during the war.”  The air in the underground tunnels was pretty fetid. “Doctors say ‘oh, you’ve got 1920s lungs’, but here we are, still here” she jokes.After a few months underground with only occasional respite in the open air, her military commanders decided the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists were suffering from Vitamin D deficiency.The group of about 50 women were made to sit in a large circle in a room, with sunlamps in the middle facing out. They were issued with goggles and all told to strip to the waist.“We were ordered to have compulsory sunlamp treatment,” she said, “it was all rather hilarious.“There were all shapes and sizes. It was so hilarious and such a novelty most of us sat there with tears streaming from under our goggles.”Marie Scott has been awarded the Legion d\u0026#39Honneur, France\u0026#39s highest honour, for the efforts of her and her colleagues in liberating France from Nazi occupation. Vitamin D helps regulate calcium and phosphate in the body. Having too little Vitamin D can lead to pain in the bones and muscles.Sun lamps were invented in the first years of the last century. One of the first regular users was King George V, who famously received light treatment for the near-fatal pneumonia he suffered in 1928.Mrs Scott lived through the blitz and had not been evacuated from London as her younger sister was at a different school and her parents had not wanted to split the girls up. Living in Clapham, she said when the docks in East London were bombed she could see the sky turning red, the fires were so enormous.She worked on a switchboard operator relaying messages from the soldiers fighting on the D-Day beaches to General Eisenhower’s headquarters.“When they passed their messages you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war.“And suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. At 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”Mrs Scott has been awarded the Legion d’Honneur, France’s highest honour, in recognition of the country’s gratitude to the service men and women of the war. Princess Anne said Marie’s Legion d’Honneur was “Typically French”. Marie replied, “Full of style”.Please review our commenting policy11 dead as gunman opens fire in Virginia Beach in latest US mass shootingTaxman lauches crackdown as number of phone scams rockets from 7,800 to more than 100,000 a yearDonald Trump backs Boris Johnson to be the next Prime MinisterObesity has become \u0026#39the new smoking\u0026#39 and will fuel weight-related cancers, head of NHS warnsGCHQ warns over Google and Mozilla plans for encrypted browsers Elton John condemns removal of homosexual scenes from his biopic Rocketman in RussiaComment: The intellectually barren Tories are losing the battle of ideas against the LeftDavid Cameron uses memoirs to settle scores with \u0026#39backstabbing\u0026#39 Michael GoveBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2019, live semi-final 5, recap: no bloopers or storm-offs, just a reasonable amount of talentOne person in 10 is mistaken about the identity of their father, reveals NHS chiefSajid Javid reveals he is prepared to take Britain out of EU without a dealCashless Britain revealed: Councils, bus services and shops are banning coins and notesScanners developed to search the Universe for stars could slash queues at airport securityHaunting picture of Budapest boat at the bottom of the Danube as search for the 21 missing continuesFarmers welcome documents showing sea eagles do kill healthy lambsComment: Our ruling elite is destroying itself with grief over the death of BlairismBirmingham pub bombing families to receive less in legal aid than coroner spent on PR teamComment: My advice to the next Tory leader is this – ditch the deal, and pursue a free trade agreement to unite our partyBirmingham City Council wins High Court injunction to stop protests against LGBT teaching at schoolBrexit Party candidate Mike Greene not fazed by Boris Johnson and Gordon Brown on campaign trailParis court finds Briton Ian Bailey guilty in Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder caseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/31/TELEMMGLPICT000155854948_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SL3vPOKTusd3feQ9v2tucJ0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"harry meghan split charity foundation shared cambridges","story":"Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge attend a Q\u0026ampA at the first annual Royal Foundation Forum in February 2018Duchess of CambridgePrinces William and Harry and their wives are to work together on \u0027one off\u0027 charitable projects, amid mounting speculation the Sussexes are to split from the foundation the couples set up together.In a sign of a further distancing between the two royal households Prince William and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, are set to work on their own separate projects, while occasionally coming together for shared initiatives.It comes after it was announced the two households of the Sussexes and Cambridges are to be run separately, following Prince Harry and Meghan’s move of their family home from Kensington Palace to Windsor.But palace sources have indicated that both couples are set to go their own way when pursuing their philanthropic and social activism interests.A source said: “They are all excited about what the future holds for what they can achieve with their charitable activity.“But they are also looking forward to working together on big one off projects such as mental health issues.”When the Royal Foundation charity was set up by Prince William and Prince Harry in 2009 it was heralded as a sign of the close emotional and working relationship between the two brothers.With their two wives coming on board over the following years the foundation became one of the most glamorous organisations in the charitable sector. Last year ‘the Fab Four’, as they were known to their fans, attended a Q\u0026ampA forum about their work under the slogan Making A Difference Together.During the session Tina Daheley, the host, asked if they ever had disagreements.William replied “Oh yes”. When she Daheley asked how they resolved their last disagreement, the princes responded: “Is it resolved? We don’t know!”Prince Harry added: “It’s really good we’ve got four different personalities and we’ve all got that same passion to want to make a difference. Those different opinions work really well.”But it is now understood that the two royal couples have different ideas about what causes to focus on and how to pursue them, with one source telling The Sun: “Meghan and Harry want to do things differently to William and Kate.”A board meeting on June 19 is expected to confirm that the Royal Foundation members will split.Its work revolves around six main themes of mental health, wildlife conservation, young people and the welfare of the armed forces and their families.A spokesman for the foundation said: “The work to prepare both couples for their future roles will of course have implications for how they manage their charitable and philanthropic activity into the future.“We are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review, but we will be able to announce it publicly once all aspects are concluded.”The spokesman added: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are committed to the work they are carrying out through The Royal Foundation and are proud of what they have achieved together.”Duchess of Cambridge11 dead as gunman opens fire in Virginia Beach in latest US mass shootingTaxman lauches

The company argued that it had attempted to revive the service by allowing anyone to chat on it and with new features.BlackBerry phones still exist – and the newest one claims to be iconicThree years ago, we set out to reinvigorate BBM consumer service, one of the most loved instant messaging applications, as a cross-platform service where users can not only chat and share life experiences, but also consume content and use payment services, the company wrote.We poured our hearts into making this a reality, and we are proud of what we have built to date.But users had gone elsewhere already and not enough users came back to the app to make it worth running it.The technology industry however, is very fluid, and in spite of our substantial efforts, users have moved on to other platforms, while new users proved difficult to sign on, the company wrote.It ended with a sentimental note about the conversations that had been shared over the service.We are grateful for your support and wish to thank everyone, especially our users, partners, and employees, for being part of the BBM consumer service journey, it concluded. We hope you will cherish many fond memories of BBM consumer service that helped shape messenger platforms to become what they are today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher HootonDoppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab720 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.2020 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go.

But, the author tells David Barnett, it almost never made it to the screen at allClick to followThe IndependentMichael Sheen and David Tennant in the series, on screens tomorrowIn the first episode of Good Omens, Aziraphale, an angel, played by Michael Sheen, and Crowley, a demon (a cat-eyed David Tennant), are sitting by the duck pond in St James’s Park discussing the imminent end of, well, everything.\u0026nbspThe Antichrist has been born into the world and – this might sound familiar if you’re au fait with the whole Antichrist apocalypse movie genre – has been cunningly placed by Satan’s soldiers on the earthly plane with the family of an American diplomat.The reference to The Omen from 1976 is not lost on Aziraphale, nor is the fact that he’s one of the lead characters in what’s sure to be one of the biggest TV hits of the year. “An American diplomat,” he sighs. “Really? As if armageddon were a cinematographic show you wished to sell in as many countries as possible.”Were this Fleabag, Michael Sheen would at this point have raised an eyebrow at the camera. The six episodes of the show are unleashed in their entirety on Amazon Prime tomorrow, with a BBC broadcast in weekly parts to come later in the year. By which time, yes, it probably will have been seen in as many countries as possible.Good Omens the novel was originally published in 1990, a collaboration between Sir\u0026nbspTerry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. If you’re familiar with Pratchett, it might be through his Discworld novels and their Sky TV adaptations. Similarly, you might know Neil Gaiman from The Sandman graphic novels, his bestsellers The Ocean at the End of the Lane and Norse Mythology, or the Amazon Prime adaptation of his 2001 novel American Gods.Good Omens is none of these, yet has flavours of all of them. It’s apocalyptic, of course, dealing with the fact that the end is exceedingly nigh, much like American Gods. And it’s funny, too, laugh-out-loud funny in parts, as are Pratchett’s\u0026nbspDiscworld books. But it’s very much its own thing, the fruit of a combination of rare talents, and something never, sadly, to be repeated.Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual.

The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” On Tuesday evening a premiere was held for the Good Omens TV series in London’s Leicester Square. On the front row of the cinema there was a reserved seat that nobody ever sat in. It was instead occupied by a hat, scarf and\u0026nbspbox of popcorn.“When we used to talk about Good Omens and whether it would ever be a film or TV show,” says Gaiman, “Terry always used to say he would not ever believe anyone would adapt Good Omens until he was sitting there watching it and eating popcorn, and would probably not believe it even then.”Pratchett died in 2015, aged just 66, eight years after going public with the fact that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s. He was already a national treasure by then, thanks to his prolific output and, in his latter years, becoming a patron for the Alzheimer’s Society and making a BBC documentary about living with the condition.Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\u0027s novel - trailerAfter a career as a journalist and a press officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, he became a full-time writer in 1987, after the publication of his fourth Discworld novel, Mort, and settled into a role as a true literary character, rarely seen without his trademark black fedora hat. It was that hat that took pride of place on the front row of the Odeon on Tuesday night.“Having Terry Pratchett’s hat front-and-centre with a big bag of popcorn meant the absolute world to me,” says Gaiman.Gaiman at an ‘American Gods’ viewing party in March, another Amazon Prime adaptation\u0026nbsp(Robin MarchantGetty)Good Omens was born when Gaiman wrote the opening chapter and sent it to his friend Pratchett to see what he thought. It had a working title of “William the Antichrist”, riffing off the very British rough-and-tumble William books by Richmal Crompton, and posited the simple question: what would happen if the son of Satan was an ordinary boy from Suburbia?They plotted the novel together over the phone, and would write chunks of the story inidually, exchanging their work on floppy disks sent through the post. When it was published, the book garnered a clutch of genre nomination awards and became a firm favourite among fans of both authors.There had been mutterings about some kind of screen adaptation of Good Omens since around 2011, but following Pratchett’s death Gaiman declared publicly that he would never embark on such a project without his friend and collaborator. Then Gaiman received a letter, written by Pratchett before he died, who had presciently anticipated that TV was becoming a much mightier force in terms of sprawling adaptations, and urged Gaiman to forge ahead with a Good Omens show. The missive from beyond the grave was entirely in keeping with Pratchett’s sense of humour, and so on-message with the whole tone of Good Omens that it might as well have been a discarded plot point.Pratchett\u0026nbspmight have gone, but we still have his representative on earth in the shape of Rob Wilkins. Wilkins had been a constant figure by\u0026nbspPratchett’s\u0026nbspside for years. He was described as\u0026nbspPratchett’s\u0026nbspassistant, but that doesn’t really cover how deeply Wilkins was embedded in\u0026nbspPratchett’s\u0026nbspcareer and life. So much so, that along with\u0026nbspGaiman, he is an executive producer on the\u0026nbspGood Omens\u0026nbspseries.The obvious question for Wilkins is what would\u0026nbspPratchett\u0026nbspthink of the show? It is, as you might expect, one he’s been asked a lot recently. “In Terry’s lifetime, I had no idea what he thought about anything,” laughs Wilkins. “Some days he would want milk in his tea, some days not. Terry\u0026nbspPratchett\u0026nbspwas a very difficult man to predict.“But the question of what Terry would have thought of\u0026nbspGood Omens\u0026nbspis actually a very simple one to answer. Having Neil\u0026nbspGaiman\u0026nbspas the\u0026nbspshowrunner, having him on set since day one, knowing everything that Neil has put into this show, the birthdays and anniversaries he’s missed, the novels he hasn’t written… Terry would just have been delighted that Neil’s been the one to see this through.20th Century Fox)“He would have loved everything about Good Omens, from the production to the design to David Arnold’s music, and he would have absolutely loved Neil’s screenplay.”It’s been an exhausting few years for Gaiman, who has poured everything into the Good Omens production, shuttling back and forth between London and his home in the US, where he lives with musician Amanda Palmer and their young son Ash. He says:\u0026nbsp“It feels like I’ve been climbing a mountain, and I reached the peak of it in January or February, when the production was finished. When the show is launched on Amazon Prime on Friday I’ll finally feel like I’m starting to head back down the mountain and go home.”The idea that 30 years on humanity has done absolutely nothing about these things just strikes me as obscene. This is essentially the same\u0026nbspGood Omens\u0026nbspstory as it was then, it just happens to be a lot more appropriate now than we could ever have imaginedAfter months and months of filming and locking himself away in dark editing suites, Gaiman finally got to see the six episodes of Good Omens in their entirety and in the correct order for the first time last week. “It was incredible,” he says. “To see it all, made by the best crew you could ever get, with such an amazing cast.”The cast really is a stellar one. Tennant and Sheen head it up, of course, but there’s plenty of talent on the screen around them, from Jon Hamm as the officious angel Gabriel, to Anna Maxwell Martin’s Beelzebub, Josie Lawrence as remarkably accurate soothsayer and Lancastrian witch Agnes Nutter, Jack Whitehall as the descendent of a witchfinder general. Veteran actor Brian Cox lends his stentorian tones to the voice of Death, Frances McDormand offers a very soothing God voiceover, while Benedict Cumberbatch plays her Satanic counterpart.And while Good Omens hits screens with incredible production values, as we’ve come to expect from the most high-end contemporary TV extravaganzas, it is a very British show indeed – especially where the humour is concerned.The central idea follows Sheen’s Aziraphale, an angel who has become quite accustomed to living a comfortable life on earth, running a bookshop and enjoying classical music, sushi\u0026nbspand the finer things in life. Tennant’s Crowley is a rockstar of a demon, flying by the seat of his pants and doing just enough – aided by overblown reports to his bosses in Hell – to ensure he can live a decent and undisturbed life as the Other Place’s emissary in the mortal world. Over the millennia, the two have developed a close friendship, despite their obvious differences, and the prospect of armageddon bringing their lives crashing down does not sit well with them at all.The main plot device is a classic trope of British comedy. Entrusted with getting the newborn Antichrist into the care of the unwitting American diplomat and his wife, Crowley becomes embroiled in a farcical (in the finest way) episode with an order of Satanic nuns involving a three-way baby switch which, inevitably, results in the actual Antichrist mistakenly going to live with an unassuming couple played by Daniel Mays and Sian Brookes.Pratchett died in 2015, aged 66. He had early-onset Alzheimer’s\u0026nbsp(Ian GavanGetty)There’s something almost gloriously Carry On\u0026nbspabout the scenes in the convent (without the smut), and Gaiman throws out a whole slew of references and inspirations for the comedic aspects of the show, from the films of Powell and Pressburger to Monty Python’s Life of Brian to Douglas Adams.In fact, the opening sequence of the first episode, in which\u0026nbspMcDormand’s God brings viewers rapidly up to speed, is incredibly redolent of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which Adams wrote as a radio show, then a series of novels, then a 1981 TV show, and that’s no accident.“That’s definitely a homage to Hitchhiker’s,” says Gaiman. “It’s perhaps what it would look like if they made a TV series of it now.”The curious thing about Good Omens, perhaps, is that for an adaptation of a novel that was published almost 30 years ago, it seems actually as relevant today as it did in 1990… in fact, more so. Pratchett and Gaiman\u0026nbspstarted writing the novel in 1988, when the world was just about to start emerging, blinking, from the depths of the Cold War. By the time it was published in 1990, there was almost whiff of optimism in the air.“There was a line we put into the novel, between the first and second drafts, that reflected that,” says Gaiman. “We said something like wasn’t it a shame armageddon had to happen, because there was Glasnost and the Berlin Wall coming down, and everything was starting to feel a bit nice.“When it came to writing the screenplay, I realised I couldn’t put that line in the TV show because the idea of everything starting to feel nice would just make it feel so dated. None of the problems we talked about in the book, from climate change to war, appear to have been sorted out. The idea that 30 years on humanity has done absolutely nothing about these things just strikes me as obscene.“This is essentially the same Good Omens story as it was then, it just happens to be a lot more appropriate now than we could ever have imagined.”Good Omens review: Pratchett \u0026amp Gaiman’s whimsical book brought to lifeThe first trailer for Good Omens is hereBenedict Cumberbatch joins Good Omens cast as release date announcedDavid Tennant and Michael Sheen cast in Good Omens adaptationGaiman got the scripts drafted in summer 2016, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, the result of which surprised him. And the US presidential election campaign was getting underway. Gaiman says:\u0026nbsp“So I thought, OK, this has happened in Britain. But the American’s aren’t idiots, they’re not going to elect Donald Trump…” He pauses and adds:\u0026nbsp“I identify with people who like the world, people who want to continue living there calmly, who want to raise their children to think it’s a good thing that the world has a future.”Where, in other words, armageddon is confined to works of entertainment such as Good Omens. It’s been a long old haul getting Good Omens to the TV screen, and Gaiman confesses that had he known just how much work it would be, how much time and energy it would eat up, he might have had second thoughts about taking the project on.But\u0026nbspWilkins is adamant that only Gaiman\u0026nbspcould have brought his and Pratchett’s\u0026nbspvision to life like this. He says:\u0026nbsp“Neil was on set every day, in the edit suite every day, in post-production every day. Without Neil, the Good Omens series just could not have happened.”And, says Gaiman, “once you\u0026nbspstart walking down that road, there’s no turning back.” But he didn’t make Good Omens for himself. He says:\u0026nbsp“I didn’t do it for the TV critics, I didn’t do it for the audiences, I didn’t even do it for Rob, I didn’t make it for anyone, except for one person. I made Good Omens for Terry Pratchett.”Willikins tells us that Pratchett would have loved Good Omens. But imagine if he’d been here to not only see it, but be involved in the production itself. Gaiman smiles, and knows exactly how that would have panned out. “What would have happened if Terry had been alive is that I would have sent him the scripts and he would have said, yes, very good, but I’ve just played with a few things. And he would have made it exactly 17 per cent\u0026nbspfunnier.”Good Omens will be\u0026nbspavailable in its entirety on Amazon Prime tomorrowOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

(Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.“Through the writing I had confronted personal, serious and at times painful issues. By the end of it I felt lighter and freer. This was one of the last songs written for the new album,” he added.“The song is a daydream fantasy. Like a heat mirage, and makes me feel like anything is possible.”The singer will begin a European tour on 10 November in London.He will then perform in Spain and France before heading to Switzerland and wrapping up in Italy.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Portman’s character, Celeste, is certainly one of the most objectionable figures she has played: a pampered, hard-drinking drug-taking “floozy” whose appearance and high-handed behaviour rekindle memories of Liz Taylor and Joan Crawford at their monstrous worst.It’s a rare and precious feeling when a film completely dismantles you. Eighth Grade – the directorial debut of US comedian Bo Burnham – breaks down every delusion we have about ourselves and burrows deep into those parts we’ve made such an effort to lock away. You may cry. You may shudder as every awkward social interaction that’s kept you up at night replays in your head all at once. You may feel the sharp pain associated with those moments when you feel completely isolated from the world. Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.The Avengers cycle comes to a rich and very satisfying conclusion with Endgame, surely the most complex and emotional superhero movie in Marvel history. At 181 minutes, this is a veritable epic, but with so many characters and plot strands, it fully warrants its lengthy running time.“Macabre and fraught though The Favourite gets, this isn’t so much a film about sex or power as it is about plain mischief. It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher HootonDoppelgangers abound in Jordan Peele’s weird, creepy and ingenious new horror film. As in his Oscar-winning 2017 feature Get Out, Peele leavens matters with ironic humour but the joking becomes increasingly uncomfortable once the main characters come face to face with dark shadows of themselves which wish them extreme harm.“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab720 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic. The rest of the world is at fault, not Lee.” Geoffrey MacnabGreen Book flatters the audience about its own good sense and tolerance. It deals with racism and homophobia but still has a fairytale, fantasy feel to it. Whatever humiliations Don endures on their road trip, we know no real harm will ever come to him as long as Tony is at his side.” Geoffrey Macnab“The golden age of bonkers horror movies is gloriously evoked by Netflix’s latest feature length presentation. Beginning as a satire of the arts world, Velvet Buzzsaw swiftly and gleefully descends into a savage splatter-fest, smeared in paint, viscera and garishly-bright blood.” Ed Power“Written by Ben Elton and directed by its star Kenneth Branagh, the film plays so fast and loose with the playwright’s final years that they needn’t have bothered fitting Branagh with a prosthetic nose – accuracy is clearly not the priority here.” Alexandra PollardThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part is the doomed progeny of a celebrated genius – brilliant but slightly stunted by the knowledge they will never live up to their predecessor.” Clarisse Loughrey“Nicolas Pesce’s sleek and stylish horror comedy is repulsive and funny by turns. In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable. Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead. He’s an irrepressible figure with such an inbuilt sense of moral decency the film seems upbeat and optimistic, even at its darkest moments.” Geoffrey MacnabRalph Fiennes combines thriller elements with poetic flashbacks to ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev’s childhood and keeps a tight focus on the dancer. When he is most at risk, Nureyev makes decisions with his artistic future more in mind than his personal safety. As Fiennes reminds us again and again in what is his best film yet as a director, the \u0027white crow\u0027 will do anything to put himself in the limelight, the one place he is convinced he belongs.Border reverses the perspective taken by most other horror films. In more conventional genre fare, Tina and Vore would be portrayed as malevolent outsiders, but in the world conjured up by director Ali Abbasi, the humans are the monsters. Tina is the innocent – a visionary who hardly understands her own powers but who can sense human venality and corruption wherever it appears.2020 Fighting with My FamilyCertain scenes feel very trite and predictable but the film gets you in a choke hold early on and won’t let you go. It is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest.

It is not known exactly how this process occurred, but a research team from Kyoto University in Japan has revealed the first ever evidence of wild chimps habitually catching and consuming freshwater crabs.The findings may provide scientists with new insight into the behaviours which drove our own progress, the scientists suggest.Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, the team describes year-round, freshwater crab-fishing behaviour – primarily among female and infant chimpanzees – living in the rainforest of the Nimba Mountains in Guinea, west Africa.“The aquatic fauna our ancestors consumed likely provided essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, required for optimal brain growth and function,” said lead author Kathelijne Koops from the University of Zurich and Kyoto University’s leading graduate programme in primatology and wildlife science.Created with Sketch.

For two years, they documented the demographics and behaviour of the group of chimps, while also analysing and comparing the nutritional value of the crabs to other foods in the chimpanzees’ diet.Crabbing, they learned, not only took place year-round – without regard to season or fruit availability – but intriguingly was negatively correlated with the chimps’ consumption of ants, another diet staple. Mature males were the least likely to consume aquatic fauna.“Energy and sodium levels in large crabs are comparative with ants,” Dr Koops said, “leading us to hypothesise that crabs may be an important year-round source of protein and salts for females – especially when pregnant or nursing – and for growing juveniles.”The study sheds light on our own evolution by illustrating that fishing behaviours may not be restricted by habitat as could be assumed.Chimpanzees filmed eating tortoises after smashing their shells openMystery ‘ghost species’ of chimpanzee discovered in bonobo DNAChimpanzees have much cleaner beds than humans do, scientists findChimpanzees learn to play rock, paper, scissors “This isn’t the first case of non-human primates eating crabs,” said senior co-author Tetsuro Matsuzawa, “but it is the first evidence of apes other than humans doing so.”He said notable previous observations of primates eating crabs came from “monkey species in locations consistent with aquatic faunivory – lakes, rivers, or coastlines – and not in closed rainforest.”He added: “It’s exciting to see a behaviour like this that allows us to improve our understanding of what drove our ancestors to ersify their diet.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes. One misconception is that these will be special “high-speed”\u0026nbsppremium services with higher ticket prices for rich passengers. That isn’t true – these will be the ordinary journey times between those cities, integrated into the existing network.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion: Climate change protests cause chaos in London Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester gives a thumbs up as he stalls a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in London246 City of LondonProtesters hold up traffic on Upper Thames Street in the City of LondonProtesters hold a banner as they hold up a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in LondonOfficers remove plants that were placed in the occupation of Waterloo BridgePolice officers arrive at Oxford Circus as they prepare to remove protesters during the fifth day of a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group, April 19An activist waters the plants at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeUndeterred by over 400 arrests, climate change activists continued their demonstration into a fifth day in London with a small protest at the country\u0027s main Heathrow Airport, along with the ongoing protest camps at other iconic locations around the British capitalProtesters with the words \u0027glued on\u0027 written on their hands hold hands as police officers arrive at Oxford CircusOfficers circle the lorry that serves as the central stage to the Waterloo Bridge occupation, repeating their tactic from a earlier at the Oxford Circus occupationOxford Circus reopens after being closed for days due to occupationOfficers prepare to move in on the occupation of Waterloo BridgeActivists relax on a sofa at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeBritish actress Emma Thompson talks to members of the media from atop the pink boat after police officers surrounded the boat being used as a stage as climate change activists occupy the road junction at Oxford Circus  in central London during the fifth day of environmental protesst by the Extinction Rebellion groupAn Extinction Rebellion demonstrator is carried away by police on Waterloo BridgeActivists on Waterloo Bridge have made a garden for their occupation site, April 20Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on April 15 at the start of a civil disobedience campaign calling for governments to declare an ecological emergency over climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt bioersity loss and be led by new citizens\u0027 assemblies on climate and ecological justiceEmma Thompson joins the Extinction Rebellion protest at Oxford Circus.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.HS2\u0026nbsphave been fierce every since the project was open to a public consultation in 2010\u0026nbsp(Getty)So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.HS2 will be key part of strategy to fix capacity problems for trainsIn the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance. Probably while they sit on the floor of an overcrowded train.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the Labour leader resisted pressure from shadow cabinet colleagues to campaign for a new referendum, saying he would try to renegotiate a deal with Brussels.In a sign of the deep tensions within the party, Unite leader Len McCluskey warned that supporting another referendum would be “electorally suicidal”.Now a YouGov poll putting Labour equal with Tories on 19 per cent in general election voting intentions, behind the Lib Dems on 24 and the Brexit Party on 22, has sparked fresh fears that the European results may reflect more than just a protest vote.Mr Campbell, who was expelled from Labour for voting Lib Dem in an act of anti-Brexit protest, said the party had been “virtually annihilated” in last week’s election.The Tory leadership race looks like an exercise in Brexit time wastingWhy UK is days from a political earthquake that will shape BrexitPro-Corbyn MPs are considering life without their leader“The Labour party has not had a clear, coherent, credible position on Brexit and until it gets that, it is not going to win back the support of many, many people that it has lost,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.Stephen Doughty, a pro-Remain Labour MP, said: “These polls show exactly why the time for equivocation and triangulation is long past. It is crucial Labour now takes a definitive position to support putting any Brexit deal to the people for their final say, with an option to remain.“It’s what our voters and our members want. Labour must lead the fight against this disastrous Brexit that the Tories have led us to, and stand resolute in the face of the populist right. To fail to do so would be a mistake of historic proportions for the country and our party will pay a heavy price.”Mary Creagh, a former shadow cabinet minister, said it was “very worrying” to see that just 47 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2017 told pollsters they would do so again.There was a “clear and present danger” that the party may not be able to woo back switchers, she said.“It shows the futility of trying to please both sides on Brexit,” the Wakefield MP told The Independent. “We were punished in the local and European elections as our voters and members deserted us to back the Lib Dems and Greens, even in northern areas that voted Leave, such as Wakefield where the Lib Dem vote trebled.”Mr Corbyn has suggested that the party’s policy on Brexit could be reviewed at the next annual conference in September – just a month ahead of the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU with or without a deal.But the national organiser of the Another Europe is Possible group, Michael Chessum, said this would be too late.Dems: ‘I didn’t vote Labour for the first time in my life’“These polling figures are shocking and ought to scare the whole of the left,” he said. “Labour’s electoral base is being eaten by a centrist party. It\u0027s the opposite of the leftward turn that Corbyn\u0027s leadership is trying to achieve.“Constructive ambiguity has run its course. Leading left figures – John McDonnell and Diane Abbott – are following the members towards a clear anti-Brexit position. The small number of people in the Labour machine still fighting to deliver Brexit are isolated, but their strategy is still dangerous. If they win out, the Corbyn project faces ruin.”Frontbencher Clive Lewis – who quit the shadow cabinet in 2017 to vote against triggering the Article 50 process – said Labour was in an “unacceptable situation”.Voters have not “bought into” Mr Corbyn’s position, he said. “People now want clarity from the Labour Party. It is painful to watch. Many of these are voters who have voted for a party other than Labour for the first time and their support for that other party will solidify over the coming days and months unless we act.”And one of Labour’s most forthright supporters of leaving with a deal, Stephen Kinnock, said Labour was suffering from a lack of clarity on the single issue dominating British politics.“One way or the other, we have got to deal with Brexit,” he said. “We should either have given whole-hearted full-throated support for a referendum or stuck to our original position. By trying to face both ways we just lose people’s support and we lose their respect.”A Labour spokesperson declined to comment, saying that the party does not respond to polls.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In contemporary Russia, how they are counted is, it would seem, just as important.\u0026nbspLast week, a new poll by state pollsters VTsIOM revealed a worrying state of affairs for the Kremlin. Only 31.7 per cent of respondents said they trusted their president. The new baseline, which represented a 13-year low, led usually loyal publications to conclude that Russians were close to “losing patience” with Vladimir Putin.\u0026nbspFast forward to Thursday, and the Kremlin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov was fielding questions about the polling. Was the president worried about falling levels of trust? Mr Peskov, audibly irritated, answered that the polling was “not consistent” with figures he had seen.\u0026nbsp“How can trust fall, but electoral rating increase?\u0026nbsp… We await their analysis of the correlation of figures.”\u0026nbspOvernight, VTsIOM answered the spokesperson’s call and issued an update to its polling figures. The headlines changed: in fact, 72.3 per cent of Russians trusted Vladimir Putin.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Anti-Putin protests: hundreds of demonstrators arrested in Russia Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Russian police officers detain a protester in MoscowPro-Kremlin activists and opposition supporters scuffle in MoscowAlexei Navalny during the rallyRussian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rallyAlexei Navalny being carried away by policeDemonstrator carries a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during a massive protest rally in St.PetersburgRussian police detain a protester at a demonstration A fighter of National Liberation Movement, left, clashes with protesters Russian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rally Russian police detain a protester in Pushkin Square in MoscowProtesters attend a rally in St. PetersburgRussian police officers detain a protester in MoscowPro-Kremlin activists and opposition supporters scuffle in MoscowAlexei Navalny during the rallyRussian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rallyAlexei Navalny being carried away by policeDemonstrator carries a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during a massive protest rally in St.PetersburgRussian police detain a protester at a demonstration A fighter of National Liberation Movement, left, clashes with protesters Russian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rally Russian police detain a protester in Pushkin Square in MoscowProtesters attend a rally in St. PetersburgThe difference in figures, pollsters said, was down to methodology and a rephrased question. Last week’s poll was done with open lists, allowing voters to name the politician they most trusted. The new\u0026nbsppoll used closed lists, and instead asked people what they thought about inidual politicians.\u0026nbsp“Before we limited ourselves to non-personalised questions about trust in politicians, and that got in the way of people expressing their opinion,” said Valery Fedorov, VTsIOM’s director.“We hope that the new picture will be clearer to our audience and to the journalistic community.” \u0026nbspInside the real Russia: What ordinary citizens really think of PutinVTsIOM is Russia’s largest\u0026nbsppolling organisation, but with close links to the Kremlin, is not considered reliable on key data. That was not always the case, and in the 1990s its team of sociologists were well-regarded. But early in Mr Putin’s presidency, most of the previous\u0026nbspteam\u0026nbspwalked out, claiming intolerable pressure from the Kremlin.The private organisation they founded in response, the Levada Centre, has since been labelled a “foreign agent” under controversial NGO-funding laws.\u0026nbspLevada Centre’s present-day director Lev Gudkov told The Independent that its own independent polling mirrors both sets of VTsIOM’s findings, but at 5-10 percentage points lower. Levada also uses a split methodology of open and closed lists, he revealed.But the veteran pollster offered a fundamentally different interpretation on what the results said about the “true” level of Vladimir Putin’s support.\u0026nbsp“We always ask people to name politicians they trust, and we do this for the simple reason that it gets us closer to the situation we’d see if we had competitive elections,” he said. Levada Centre’s most recent figures roughly mirror VTsIOM’s 32-72 split – with 30 per cent trusting\u0026nbspthe president on open lists (where responders name politicians themselves) and 65 per cent on closed lists.\u0026nbsp“That 65 per cent is essentially a reflection of the monstrous propaganda we have in Russia, and almost approximates to forced voting,” Mr Gudkov said. \u0026nbspRegardless of the methodology used, polling trends show a concerning picture for the Kremlin.\u0026nbspRussian voters this week face a difficult choice – Putin or PutinIn the 10 months since August, Mr Putin’s rating has dropped more than 20 per cent and is showing little sign of bouncing back. The shift coincides almost exactly with the introduction of controversial reforms to raise the pension age. But it also reflects a wider malaise connected to sanctions, low oil prices, falling real-term\u0026nbspwages (13 per cent down over the past five years) and a restriction of civil rights.\u0026nbspGiven that background, the raw polling data was not altogether terrible news, said the independent political expert Maria Lipman. They still showed a “general acquiescence”, if not great enthusiasm, for the idea of Mr Putin as president. They also showed the president\u0026nbspremained, by far, the country’s most trusted and popular politician.\u0026nbspInstead, the Kremlin’s sensitive response probably reflected the\u0026nbsp“negative publicity” generated around\u0026nbspthe poll, she said.\u0026nbsp“Of course, they will be worried about the hype. And they\u0026nbspwill have hated the headlines about Putin’s trust at a historical low.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the potential ­leadership contenders privately understand it, as do growing numbers of MPs.The question is whether they are brave enough to place such an unpopular truth before party members.When I predicted six weeks ago that the Conservative Party was headed for a single-figures vote in the European election unless it ditched Theresa May, there was much scoffing.Yes, I was told, things would be bad, but not that bad. Well, on Thursday, we secured . per cent.If we break that vote down by constituency, every single Tory MP loses.The first-past-the-post system is capricious. It protects you until, all of a sudden, it eliminates you.Just ask Scottish Labour.As long as our political debate revolves around Brexit, people are likely to vote for the most hardline pro and anti-Brexit parties.Indeed, the longer this wretched argument goes on, the more radicalised both sides become. Voters identy as Remain or Leave rather than according to their old party alignments.Three years ago, at the time of the referendum campaign, it was still a civil conversation rather than a civil war.The polarisation has come since the result, and it has become worse with every passing week.Most Leavers now want No Deal. Most Remainers want another referendum.The moment when both sides might have accepted a compromise — ideally a Swiss-type solution that would have taken us out of the EU’s political structures while retaining close economic links — has probably passed.So whose fault is it that we are in this situation  Hardliners on both sides must take their share of the blame.Those Remainers who promised to respect the result but then worked to frustrate it have done terrible damage to our politics.Those Leavers who, forgetting everything they said during the campaign, now insist that anything short of No Deal is a betrayal, have likewise destroyed trust in the system.But the chief responsibility lies with Theresa May.It was she who dug in on the wrong issues while conceding on the wrong issues, who mulishly insisted that it was all about immigration, who managed to convince both sides that she was secretly working for the other, who so aggravated EU leaders that, by the end, they were predisposed to reject anything she asked for because it was she who was doing the asking.Worst of all, she called and then lost the  election. From that moment, it was clear that our Parliament was prepared to frustrate Brexit.The EU got the message and started making deliberately absurd and vindictive demands, culminating in the Irish backstop which, incredibly, Theresa May accepted.We now face withdrawal terms so disadvantageous that they are worse than either staying or quitting — exactly as Michel Barnier intended.Which brings us back to the Catch-.Parliament does not intend to allow any government to leave the EU with No Deal, and the Commons Speaker has made clear that he is prepared to bend the rules in any way necessary to secure that end.In normal times, a Conservative leader would go to the country saying: “Give me the mandate I need. If Brussels knows we are ready for No Deal, we will get a good deal. We just need the numbers in Parliament.“Do you want me in charge, or a Marxist nostalgic who refuses to have a position on Brexit ”In normal times, such a leader would win comfortably. But these are not normal times.A large chunk of the electorate is now disposed to blame the Conservatives for the impasse rather than the parties that have actually been voting against Brexit.Nigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to contest every seat at the next election. The idea that he might stand aside in certain constituencies in order to stop Corbyn is based on a misunderstanding of how he operates.He is back at the head of a populist insurgent party.The last thing he wants is to have that party’s grievance addressed and so put himself out of business.Is there any solution  Possibly.It may be that Parliament cannot in fact block a No Deal Brexit. It may be that,forced to choose, MPs will baulk at voting to revoke Article .It may be that France, or another EU state, vetoes any extension beyond October  — though that is unlikely.Or it may be that the Tories could, in fact, win a general election.Perhaps I am wrong about Farage’s motivations, and he will agree to an electoral pact, fighting Labour in the North while standing aside in the South.Or maybe there’s another way out of the jam, one I can’t think of.But what cannot be denied is that the dilemma exists.There is no point in saying, “Just leave!” or “I’ll get us a better deal!” unless you are clear about how you intend to do it.The trouble is that, in the current mood, those are precisely the slogans that many Tory activists want to hear.The candidate who levels with them, who sets out the dilemma honestly and outlines a proposed route out of it, may become unelectable.

The rates burden could be reduced or stamp duty cut.There may even be some room for expenditure in pressing areas such as social care for the elderly or helping the hard-pressed police.£billion is a serious amount of money which could have a signicant domestic effect rather than being little more than overseas aid for rich ­countries.Then we could trade with the EU on the basis of the World Trade Organisation . This provides a framework for treating countries fairly. The UK, in spite of allowing the EU to represent our interests in recent years, has always been a founder member, and as soon as we have left we may resume our rightful place.The WTO allows nations to set tarfs that will then be applied to all other members in the absence of specic free trade deals.The concept of “most favoured nation” means that it is unlawful to discriminate against one country.The effect of this is that the EU could not charge higher tarfs against us than it does on goods from the United States.As the US has seen its trade with the EU grow faster since the introduction of the Single Market than the UK’s has, it is clearly no barrier to successful ­business.Likewise, the UK would have to levy the same payments on EU goods as we do on others — and here we would have a choice.Would we want to lower tarfs generally, cutting the cost of goods for ­consumers, or keep the protectionist ­barriers that make Europe so expensive It seems obvious that we ought to cut tarfs to improve living standards, ­especially for the least well-off in society, allowing them to have more money to save or spend.Historically, nations that have cut the cost of imports have become more prosperous and there are non-tarf barriers that the EU imposes purely to protect inefficient continental industries that could also be removed.Against this opportunity there are many myths that have grown up, fed and watered by those who never wanted to leave the EU.First, they say that the WTO has other agreements tacked on — over  with the US alone — and without them trade would stall.This is a misunderstanding.These add-ons include treaties such as the Paris Climate Accord which are not trade-related.Only about  have any trade relevance of which only one is important and it has already been rolled over.As they are purely technical, rolling them over is not dficult as has already been shown.Other doomsters say that just-in-time delivery cannot work under WTO — which is odd, as it already does.What matters for these processes is certainty of delivery times.The six ­seconds that it takes goods to clear customs in Southampton on average is insignicant compared to potential delays on the M which businesses already have to contend with.The UK already trades extensively and successfully on a WTO basis so ­extending it to the EU would not be problematic.The paranoid and the scaredy-cats also moan that more checks would have to be made, but again that is incorrect.Jon Thompson, the chief executive of Customs and Excise, confirmed that delays would be no worse than they ­currently are for imports.There is no WTO rule to create inefficiencies. The purpose of the organisation is the reverse. The system of cross-border trade is not that which people imagine from watching s spy films.In addition, both Calais and Dover, the only real pinch points, are both prepared and ready for No Deal.As for Ireland, the simple question remains: Who is going to build the wall There will be no hard border because no one wants one and that has always been the simple answer to a much over-complicated question.In truth the fears are like the supposed Millennium Bug, a fantasy of fevered minds.After all, with £billion, free-flowing trade and cheaper imports, as former Trade and Industry Secretary Peter ­Lilley has said: “It is not crashing out, it is cashing in.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I understand that ious MPs have been to see him to say that while they won’t vote for him, they would accept his leadership.One MP who won’t be endorsing him, though, is Amber Rudd. She and Boris sat down on Thursday. But ultimately the dferences between them over Brexit policy are too great to make any kind of dream ticket work.I understand that Rudd pushed the former Foreign Secretary to budge on his commitment that the UK would leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Johnson would not. Rudd felt that she could not support someone holding this position.Another complication was that Johnson and Rudd’s dferences on Brexit made it very hard for them to agree on a joint governing agenda. Johnson, though, should still have more votes in the first round than any other Brexiteer candidate.He needs to finish  votes clear of Dominic Raabhe is to establish himself as the clear Leave choice — Raab is more likely than him to pick up support as the second tier Brexiteer candidates drop out.As one of those backing Boris puts it: “He’s got to get as close as possible to a third on the first round.” The support of a third of MPs guarantees you a place in the members’ run-off.The problem for the former London Mayor, as this supporter acknowledges, is that “ there’s ever a perception that Boris was falling back then that would be compounded”.On the Cabinet side of the contest, Sajid Javid is attempting to reboot his campaign by today setting out his plan for how to deal with the Irish border issue.One of those backing him tells me it is “not just how you voted in the referendum, but your ability to implement no deal or negotiate with the EU” that matters. This supporter argues that Johnson and Raab aren’t going to get anything out of Brussels, while Javid might.The Cabinet side of the contest is becoming increasingly fractured. I understand that the Cabinet Ministers most opposed to No Deal have privately agreed to back either Matt Hancock or Rory Stewart in the first round. Both are running interesting campaigns.Stewart is out doing social media walkabouts, while Hancock is making arguments that the other candidates are being forced to follow. I’m told that next week he will propose a levy on betting companies to fund treatment for gambling addiction.The energy of these campaigns is causing trouble for the more established Cabinet contenders. I understand that backers of one of them are now warning MPs: “Go to bed with Hancock, wake up with Boris.”But Jeremy Hunt’s biggest problem is the sense that, in the words of one senior Tory, he is a “completely wasted place” in the final two as it is hard to see how he could beat a Brexiteer candidate.This is why a growing number of Tories think the party is “heading to the destined psycho-drama” of a Boris Gove run-off.BATTEN down the hatches, hurricane Donald is blowing into town. As his interview in this newspaper demonstrates, Donald Trump won’t be governed by the normal diplomatic conventions on his State visit.He is more than happy to make known his admiration for Boris Johnson, despite the Tory leadership contest. Though some of the rival camps think Trump’s blessing will be a double-edged sword.It is the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who will greet Trump on his arrival, which will give Hunt the chance to burnish his statesman credentials. Hunt will also be involved in Tuesday’s Downing Street talks between Trump and Mrs May.Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary, who is expected to throw her hat into the leadership ring, will meet with the President’s daughter, Ivanka, to discuss female economic empowerment.Trump is not an easy President to deal with. But he is the leader of our closest and most important security ally. UK politicians must also realise that on ious issues, including China and the role of Huawei in G networks, the Trump position represents the new political consensus in the US.The UK would be mad to endanger its most import- ant intelligence relationship over this issue.THE next test for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party comes on Thursday, with the Peterborough by-election.If Farage’s party can win, it will show how Brexit has redrawn the political landscape. It will give the Brexit Party a toe-hold in Parliament and a chance to become a formidable political force.Butthe Brexit Party can’t take a seat which voted heavily for Leave in the aftermath of its Labour MP being sent to prison, then its current momentum will be checked.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled. This is surprising given that it didn’t meet this week as Parliament was in recess. The official reason for it not taking place is that there is too much on with the Trump visit and D-Day commemorations.But as one minister points out to me, it is hard to believe that Cabinet would have been cancelledit hadn’t been for the fact that Theresa May is resigning as Tory party leader at the end of the week.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled.

Butyou’re looking for a Labour politician who has shown real leadership on Brexit, Darren is your man. He is the leader of Barking and Dagenham Council, whose citizens voted .% for Leave in , the only London borough to do so. A few months ago, I did an event with him in the area, launching a brilliant ­regeneration project, the Londoneast-UK ­business park. I witnessed, from this local ‘cor blimey’ working-class man, as passionate and articulate a denunciation of Brexit as I have heard from anyone inside or outside Parliament. He was clear there is no form of Brexit that is good for the area, and people must be given the chance to think again now we all know so much more about what Brexit entails. He refused to meet halfway with the liars who had secured a win for Leave on myths, fantasies and unicorns. He was not buying the Labour leadership’s line that there was a ‘better Brexit’ Corbyn could secure, let alone a Len McCluskey ‘jobs-first Brexit’. He was clear that theirs was just a softer form of the unicornology being peddled by Theresa May, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. On European elections night – shortly after I had admitted on TV to having voted Lib Dem in common with thousands of other Labour members to press the party to change its approach – Darren texted me. “We beat the Brexit Party in Barking and Dagenham… we listened, and won.”    When I checked out the breakdown of votes later, it was stunning. Labour ,. Brexit Party ,, Lib Dem ,, Tory ,, Green ,, UKIP ,. I repeat – this in an area which voted Leave by two to one. To turn that around so spectacularly, that is what leadership, strategy and effective campaigningcan do. Darren told me that what annoyed him about Labour’s official position, was that it presupposed opinion was static, that it could not be moved. So Labour had to go along with the ‘will of the people’ line so furiously peddled by the Brextremist press and MPs, alongside the insidious insinuation that any scrutiny of the detail, any demand for a second referendum, any call even for a proper inquiry into the lies and crimes, were tantamount to betrayal, treachery, even treason.    The real betrayal, he said, would be tacit support of a course of action that we know will hit working class people the hardest of all. He said they had defeated the British National Party in the area not by abandoning socialist, internationalist beliefs and principles but by fighting even harder for them. So while running the council, he has never stopped campaigning on a clear message that there is an alternative to the reckless fantasy offered by the Brexiteers’ brigade. If only Jeremy Corbyn had shown the same leadership and strategic skills as Darren Rodwell, Labour would not be in the mess it’s in now. Corbyn needs to chop up the table on which he says all options are sitting, use the wood to build a soapbox, and start campaigning unequivocally for a People’s Vote, with the option to Remain. Yes, it may push some away from Labour, but their numbers will be dwarfed by the support lost last week to the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP, Plaid and Change UK.   I was  last week, and had the best birthday surprise of my le – an email out of the blue asking for a chat about my BBC documentary on depression, from none other than Eric bloody Clapton. So there I am two days later, in his kitchen, talking depression, drink, drugs, love, hate, grief, kids, football, cricket, guitars, bagpipes and plenty more. Clapton has had similar depressed and suicidal feelings to mine at dferent times of his le, nailing the myth that somehow depression is less likelyyou have wealth or fame. Anyway, it was fabulous to spend a few hours one-on-one in his company. Even better, he came out publicly for a second referendum, saying we would all be better offwe hadn’t had the first one. Ledge. Total ledge. The ‘is he a liar ’ Boris Johnson trial – er, need we ask  – is focusing on the big black lie on the big red bus, promising more money for the NHS. But I hope their learned friends have not overlooked the oft-made claim that ‘Turkey is joining the EU’, and that a vote for Leave was ‘the last chance’ to stop our country being over-ridden by millions of Turks. That this man should be favourite to become our Prime Minister is being viewed by governments around the world as further evidence that we are a country suicidally engineering our own decline and humiliation. Might I also suggest that when anyone argues it is undemocratic to have a People’s Vote, given all we now know about the implications of Brexit, we ask, ‘What the hell is democratic about , largely elderly Tories, many of whom voted for Nigel Farage in the Euros, getting to choose our PM at this pivotal period in our history ’I have finally, under pressure from my daughter Grace, entered the world of podcasts, the two of us doing Football, Feminism and Everything In Between. We kicked off with Ed Miliband. Remember him  The one who was going to deliver chaos, not the strength and stability the Tories would provide under David Cameron. Then we had Rachel Riley, a reluctant political voice having become embroiled in Labour’s anti-Semitism row, and next up is Jamie Carragher, then Josh Widdicombe, former cricketer Ebony Rainford-Brent, rugby player Maro Itoje and Burnley manager Sean Dyche – oh yes, the gaffer must be there. I have just realised that all of them are Remainers, as are Grace and I. So we need to get a Brexiteer on soon. Thoughts welcome. Piers Morgan, part-time TV presenter and full-time spokesman for Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, tells anyone who will listenthat he has yet to meet a single soul who voted Leave and has changed their mind since. This despite me and the @RemainerNow group sending him dozens of examples of real people who have done just that and asking him to speak to them on his show. But no. Piers would prefer to be able to bask in opinions that never change, and stories that can be free of facts which might challenge them. He used to be a journalist once.   I was talking this week to a minister in a government in Asia who told me he used to make speeches about British politics as an example to the world. “Now I do the same, but it is as a bad example.

The intrepid couple cycled from Hadrian’s Wall to the Great Wall of China, covering a gruelling , miles in  months. They cycled every day and camped at night, enduring temperatures that fell to minus C in Northern China and rose to C in the deserts of Uzbekistan. In some countries they struggled to find food and in Tajikistan had to survive on biscuits for three days. Chris, , says: “Sometimes I really wanted to be at home by the wood burning stove with a glass of wine, but, apart from that, we didn’t miss anything.” Peter, , chips in: “Apart from rhubarb crumble...”    The couple, who live near Hadrian’s Wall in Carlisle, Cumbria, first came up with the idea for the trip in . Chris says: “We weren’t unhappy but we were healthy enough – so we wanted to challenge ourselves.” Although they had always cycled for fun, they were not serious about it. Peter says: “We didn’t dress in Lycra and go out on our bikes every weekend. But all our lives, we’d cycled to work or the shops.”  They bought Thorn touring bikes, got a train to Greece and cycled back as a test run. Chris says: “It was fantastic.” So they began planning their journey to China. The couple, who have two sons, and four grandchildren, set off in January .Chris says: “We had terrible weather . So when we got to Hungary, we went to a mineral spa to relax. But Peter tripped and broke his femur.”   He had surgery before they flew back to the UK but seven months later, on October , , they set off again. Chris says: “We had one change of clothes, waterproofs, a stove, pans and cutlery. It was three weeks before we reached our first country, France, when things began to feel more real.” They travelled through Europe, the Middle East and Asia before reaching the Great Wall on November , . Chris says: “The weather was a bit unnerving sometimes. The wind was so strong in Northern China that we were nearly knocked off our bikes. “The desert in Uzbekistan was C. So, having enough water and staying cool was a problem.”  They also camped every night and Chris says: “I have a sixth sense for finding good places. “But sometimes we struggled and in Italy we had to camp by the side of the road and were visited by the police. In Turkey, we camped in a cave and lit a fire, just like cavemen. It was very special.” Chris says seeing the Great Wall was “very emotional”.  She says: “I was happy and a bit surprised that we’d made it. There were lots of times when I thought we wouldn’t.” They cycled on through Laos, ­Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, before getting on a container ship back to the UK.

It took three weeks.” Chris and Peter finally arrived back in England on April  and got home on May  after cycling to Cumbria.  Chris says: “The sun was shining and our family cycled to meet us.” Reflecting on the trip, Peter says: “People are great all over the world.

He was executive principal at Sawtry Village Academy in Cambridgeshire until  when the Department for Education launched an investigation into his running of the school. The sex den was only uncovered when a roofing contractor spotted a large purple vibrator through the office skylight. Sex toys, cards depicting ious Kama Sutra acts, a game called saucy charades and shelves stacked with booze were also uncovered. Stewart, who defrauded the school of more than £,, was struck off by the Teaching Regulation Agency.    He was convicted of fraud and misconduct in public office for offences between  and , and was jailed for four years in October . During Stewart’s sentencing, school manager Peter Evans claimed the sounds emanating from office were like the Benny Hill show as the head chased his PA around the office. Stewart habitually disappeared for hours on end or entire days. He also splurged school funds on a monthly wine club and on hotel bar bills. North West Cambridgeshire MP Shailesh Vara raised the case during education questions in the House of Commons in .    He said the school had been left in serious financial dficulty, and that this was not least because of the activities of its former head which included building a sex dungeon alongside his office for his private use. A Teaching Regulation Agency  concluded in a report published on Friday that it was proportionate to ban Stewart from teaching indefinitely. The report said: Whilst Mr Stewart previously had a good record, the  found no evidence that the teacheraposs actions were not deliberate, nor was he acting under duress. In fact, the  found the teacheraposs actions to be calculated, motivated and sustained for a number of years.  It said the  took into account the signicant detrimental impact on the financial position of the college and the more lasting damage to the education of its pupils during this period, together with the longer term reputational damage as a result of Mr Stewartaposs actions. Towards the end of Stewart’s -year tenure, Ofsted placed the school in special measures. Buildings fell into disrepair and the financially ruined school didnapost have the cash to save them. The school was ranked aposgoodapos in its latest inspection. Stewart’s deputy, church-going Alan Stevens, , was spared the boot by regulators.  He made bogus expenses claims while vice-principal and was handed a two-year suspended term after admitting fraud. The Teaching Regulation Agency heard that Stevens claimed £ in expenses for his personal buys. He used school funds to pay for a National Trust membership and on train fares for his we to visit London. Deciding against a ban, the  said it took into account Stevens’ charity work and that he was seen as a “pillar of the community”. Stewart cannot reapply to teach and has  days to appeal.

But this was not confirmed and with no definite diagnosis of what was wrong she was given ovulation therapy to help her produce more eggs.

She said: “A friend had lost a lot of weight with Bodyline, so I made an appointment and from my first meeting with the clinical team I knew it was going to change my le – for the better. “The doctors and nurses are totally non-judgmental and so supportive and have given me a personalised plan that I can stick to.

Instead, she now she eats fruit pots for breakfast, healthy pasta or couscous salad at lunch and a protein heavy meal for dinner.

Brittany Guyatt says she nearly had to have a section of her finger amputated after the cut left her with a horrendous growth that smelled and left her unable to breastfeed. The -year-old claims she was cut by the aposroughapos technician while getting acrylic nails fitted ahead of giving birth to her daughter Harper last month. Over a period of days, a bruise developed into what at first looked like a blood blister but grew aposbigger and biggerapos - and shortly after giving birth, Brittany was in unbearable pain. The restaurant manager was left unable to breastfeed for fear of infecting her new baby as the growth extended off her finger by more than a centimetre and aposfilled with smelly pusapos.    As the nodule of tissue or granuloma turned black, Brittany was told she needed surgery or faced losing part of her finger. The first time mum has vowed never to have acrylic nails done again and is now warning others to make sure the equipment used on them is sterilised properly. After sharing her ordeal on social media, her warning racked up more than , likes, comments and shares from worried Facebook users horried by the images of the growth. Brittany, from Swindon, Wiltshire, said: You see these things and never think itaposll happen to you. Iaposll never have my nails done again - itaposs not worth it. Iaposd rather buy stick-on ones.  At first it looked like a little bruise, but eventually it started getting bigger and going red. It was a pinch at first, then it started to become a lump a bit like a blood blister. As it grew, it had a white, waxy look and my skin started peeling off. Then it went black and dried up. It could have been anything - even cancer. When I showed the doctor, sheaposd never seen anything like it before. Brittany and her sister had decided to get their nails done as a pre-birth pick-me-up when she claims a aposroughapos nail technician cut her with an electric file.  Shortly after the injury, the granuloma grew bigger and bigger and Brittany visited the doctors where she was prescribed steroid cream - causing her to stop breastfeeding. She also soaked it in salt water and covered it in plasters to stop it catching on things, and after Harper arrived, she worried about passing on an infection. Brittany said: Iaposd been on maternity leave and thought Iaposd make myself feel a bit better. I went to a nail salon as Iaposd been there before and never had a problem. When the man was shaping the acrylics, I felt him pinch me with the nail filer. He was quite rough and when he caught my finger, it started tingling and burning. Nothing came up until a few hours later though. I didnapost say anything at the time because they can be a bit rough anyway and theyaposve caught my skin a few times in the past.  But I did say to my sister when I walked out aposouch, he caught my hand quite sharp that timeapos. Within a few days it was a little bruise and blood blister, then over time it got bigger and bigger. I didnapost think much of it and presumed it was a little wart that might fall off. When I went into labour with Harper it was fine because Iaposd covered it with a plaster, but when I got home it started getting bigger and bigger. I was concerned about it getting infected and harming the baby. After two trips to the walk-in centre at Great Western Hospital, Swindon, Brittany was given blood tests and an X-ray to make sure the granuloma hadnapost fused to her bone. Then on Wednesday, she underwent an operation where it was was cut out - after doctors feared they would have to remove part of her finger. Brittany said: I went to the walk-in centre as it had started to smell and fill with pus. They gave me some steroid cream for it, which meant I had to stop breastfeeding my baby, and it didnapost get any better. Iaposm really disheartened by that because I was really enjoying breastfeeding and felt we had a great connection. Then I was told it would only continue to grow because there are blood vessels in it, so the only way to fix it was to scrape and burn it off. I had blood tests taken and X-rays to check it hadnapost attached to the bone, then on Wednesday I went in for the procedure.  They were worried about how low it would go down into my finger. They had a look, took a biopsy and cut it out to remove it. It was very painful but now itaposs off. It was much bigger than I thought when they showed it me in the solution before sending it off for further tests. The nurse needs to have a look next week at my stitches and I have to keep it out of water when Iaposm in the shower. Iaposve had to get help changing Harperaposs nappy too because of the bandages. Iaposm now in a lot of pain and my finger is throbbing. Brittany is now hoping by sharing her story sheaposll encourage more people to take care when choosing a nail technician. Brittany said: The doctor said it could have been the tools the salon had used. They could have been dirty. I just want other girls to make sure they see the technicians sterilise the equipment. Iaposd never seen them wipe them before. Make sure you go somewhere you trust.

Mr Patterson noted that, in March, all three were at the Ummah fitness centre in east London, they had all been at the same address at some point, and that Butt had possibly been trying to buy a gun. Investigating officer Acting Detective Chief Inspector Wayne Jolley said he did not agree that there had been missed opportunities surrounding the men and said police would have been working with the intelligence they had.    Mr Patterson pointed to the repeated contacts between the men, including a barbecue at Buttaposs home in May at which Redouane was present. Butt and Redouane were in contact with each other again and again for months and in ious ways, including at the gym and by telephone, according to Mr Patterson. He noted that three identical knives were bought by Redouane the day after the barbecue. Mr Patterson said: Any reasonably competent investigation should have been looking at Redouane at this stage, I would submit. Mr Jolley told the court: Again, that would depend on the intelligence at that time. The inquest heard that Zaghba had been going to Buttaposs gym since January and had been in telephone contact with him since that time. He had also been at Buttaposs home and was allowed to drive his car.    Mr Patterson said: All of these things, when pulled together, I would suggest, is crying out to be looked at. He also told the court that all three men were at the gym in May in the dead of night, speaking together in the street in what he described as a highly suspicious conversation. Mr Patterson also noted that a telephone was placed on the ground before the men began walking and talking during that meeting. He described this as a classic anti-surveillance technique and suggested the attack planning was there to be detected.    He added: A reasonably competent surveillance, I would suggest, would have had Butt monitored up to that point. The court was also told that Zaghba had held extremist views from childhood.He celebrated the   attacks in the US and had Islamic State flags on his Facebook page, according to writings by his mother.He also tried to fly abroad to fight for IS, and Jihadist material was found on an SD card which was seized from him when he was stopped at an airport. The hearing was told this included images of IS flags, scenes where he was joking about al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, and an online piece about a verse in the Koran which says that non-believers will go to hell.    Dominic Adamson, representing attack victim Xavier Thomasapos family said Butt had expressed a desire to travel to Syria and also to hold an attack in the UK. He said Butt was contemptuous of British culture and accessed extreme material online. He suggested it was a reasonable assumption to think that attack planning had taken place at the gym, to which Mr Jolley replied that he would always be careful about making assumptions. Richard Horwell QC, for the politan Police, asked: In the months leading up the attack was there any evidence of any attack planning  Mr Jolley replied: Not that we uncovered, sir, no.    The court heard that by June , Butt had taken himself off the WhatsApp network and his final status on it read death is the start, may Allah have mercy on us. Members of his family went on to disapprove of the attack, the court heard. A message from his sister to a friend said: Heaposs a f****** idiot. I f****** hate him but heaposs my brother. A video found by police on a telephone also showed Buttaposs uncle condemning the attacks. The court also heard that the men used multiple telephones and switched the Sim cards for no apparent reason, which is a possible anti-surveillance tactic. Mr Adamson later suggested there was a wealth of material available to the security service in October  which showed a disturbing and dangerous mindset as far as Butt was concerned.    This week the inquest heard Transport for Londonhad hired Butt to work checking for suspicious packages on the London Underground. He had been tasked with conducting security searches at Southward Underground Station, the inquest was told- despite appearing in aposThe Jihadis Next Doorapos. Addressing the failure of TfL to flag Buttaposs appearance in the Channel  TV programme, Mr Horwell said: Butt only appeared in that documentary for approximately two minutes. The officer agreed: aposIaposm almost certain he wasnapost named either. You said on at least one occasion that hindsight is a wonderful thingapos explained Horwell.    In the months leading up to the attack, was there any evidence of attack planning  None that we uncovered, the police officer concluded. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC adjourned the hearing to Tuesday at am so it is not sitting on the second anniversary of the attacks.  He said that everyoneaposs thoughts are with the families of the victims and the injured and that maybe people could take some time on Monday to reflect on what happened.

Prospective buyers have been doing shts in parked cars in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, with relatives bringing them food, sleeping bags and hot water bottles. Although the cost of the homes in the Gleeson Homes development havenapost been revealed, sources have told the Manchester Evening News that three-bed properties will be around £,. Would-be buyers have stuck makesht signs in their car windows pointing out their position in the queue - in case someone is thinking about pushing in - and which plot they are interested in. The development is being built on the site of a former primary school where the BBC drama Waterloo Road was filmed.    Charities say Britain is in the grip of an affordable housing crisis, with young people and those on low incomes struggling to get on the housing ladder. There were four vehicles parked outside the sales office yesterday, which appeared to belong to people who had been sleeping overnight. One young mother from Oldham said she had used a roster of relatives, including her husband to do aposshtsapos in the car since Monday. So far, her family has spent three nights in the car.    She said she expected they would have to remain there until next week or even the week after, depending on when Gleeson releases the as-yet unpriced property she is interested in. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: Itaposs going to be next week or the week after. They are not telling us when they will be released. Iaposm hoping it will probably be next week. She went on: Honestly, itaposs the worst procedure. Why donapost they just release all the houses so people can come and reserve a plot they want rather than people queueing up in a car  Itaposs just a ridiculous process.  She claimed she has heard of another would-be purchaser who slept on the street for nine nights. The woman is waiting for the house she is interested to reach aposstage fourapos, when the foundations have been dug and the first two rows of bricks have been laid. The sign she has erected in her own car says she is first in the queue and she says the manager in the sales officer has agreed this. Nearby residents, who are already living in their homes arenapost happy either, although they have tried to help by, for instance, by topping up hot water bottles. One neighbour said: I donapost particularly like that they are sleeping outside my house, but thereaposs nothing I can do. The resident reported that she first noticed people sleeping in their cars outside the sales officer in the new year.  Iaposve been offering anything I can, anything they need, she added. We didnapost have to do that when we got our house. We called and put down a reserve. We were the first ones in. She said she has seen pizza boxes, suggesting some of those in the queue had arranged for food to be delivered. A mother-of-two young children, who said: Itaposs first come first served. Somebody  can come in you are not here. She suggested a booking system would be a better alternative.  A statement from Gleeson read: We have a huge demand for our homes on many of our sites because it is usually cheaper to buy a Gleeson home than to rent one locally. The problem that we have is that someone is always disappointed in not achieving what would otherwise be a very positive le-changing experience. We cannot stop people sleeping in cars and we have previously tried a ticketing system, but who gets the first ticket and how  We sincerely wish that we could provide a house to everyone who wants one and we are sorryany of our potential customers are disappointed.

A study of , adults found human behaviour is considered to have had a bigger effect on the environment than deforestation and fossil fuels. More than one third believe over-population has had an impact, with  per cent not having more than three children as a result. One in  would even avoid having kids altogether to do their bit for the planet. But  per cent are confused about how they can help with the issue of climate change, with four in five believing the nation needs more education.    And half consider this lack of knowledge to be one of the barriers to dealing with climate change, along with an unwillingness to change and a lack of investment in renewable energy. The study, commissioned by The School of Health, also found  per cent think the government need to take the lead and do more to help. Mani Norland, Principal of The School of Health, said: “The research shows that while the majority feel rightly worried and anxious about climate change, they’re not sure how they can contribute or help.  “It’s clear that iniduals want the government to take the lead, invest more and set a plan in place. “Considering climate change is the biggest health risk to all humans and more, it’s interesting to see how people are willing to change. “This has the potential to be an exciting and positive time, making changes and improving the health of our planet will surely make us all feel better about the world and our impact on it – regenerating nature, wildle and the environment we live in.”    The study found that in order to try and do their bit to help, four in  would happily give up their diesel car and one sixth is prepared to swap their current vehicle for an electric one in the ‘near future’. Almost one third would avoid flying for business and  per cent are even prepared to avoid flying for pleasure. More than two thirds would willingly stop using plastic packaging and bags and  per cent would stop charging equipment overnight, such as phones and televisions. Seven in  would also be happy to reduce, or even give up, consuming red meat. But while the nation seems happy to make lestyle changes,  per cent would only consider solar electricity they were government-funded. It also emerged more than half think the authorities should invest more in green energy while  per cent believe they should subsidise more home green initiatives.Highlighting the results of climate change in the present day, one eighth of those polled know someone who has been affected by an extreme weather event - with more than one third of these being storm damage and flooding.A further  per cent of those polled via OnePoll admitted they are ‘worried’ about their health due to the impact of climate change and half are concerned over the amount of chemicals in medicines.    As a result of this people would use more complementary and alternative medicine - almost three quarters would consider using homeopathythey thought it could conserve energy and protect the environment. Mani Norland added: “As educators in natural medicine we have a passion for health and the biggest health risk to humans today is climate change. “David Attenborough has been publicising climate change on the BBC, school children have taken to the streets calling for government action, we’ve seen protests in London and major cities around the world - and this report clearly shows people are ready to make a change but want the government to take the lead. “We need more green taxes, more renewables, farming reformation, fewer CO emissions - but what can people at home do, right now, to make a dference  What are the everyday things we can all do The School of Health has created a list of  things people can do to feel empowered and engaged.  things you can personally do to help solve climate change .

Standing at just ft ins she may be tiny, but this is a woman who knows how to make herself heard. She talks happily about pets and people, art and travel. But ask what happiness means to her and she stops, choosing her words carefully. Lily says: “From the people I see walking down the street to the animals I meet in my back yard, everything on Earth is happiness to me. “Because I’m able to see the sky and hear the birds, smell the trees and the freshly cut grass. “Happiness means everything that was taken away from me for  years.” Those were the years she was held captive by kidnapper Ariel Castro, years of unimaginable horror.    In August , aged , she was lured into  Seymour Street in Cleveland, Ohio. For almost , days she woke up to torture, near-starvation and daily beatings, poisoning and rape. Five times over the years Lily became pregnant and five times evil Castro forced her to miscarry, jumping on her stomach or beating her with barbells. The physical damage was so great she won’t be able to carry a baby. Castro tried to destroy her in every way possible. But she refused to break. And now, six years after she was freed in May , she has found another form of happiness too, in the shape of Miguel. The man who made her believe in love again. Lily adds: “When I first got out of the house, one of the things that really haunted me was thinking I wouldn’t be able to trust again.  “I didn’t think I’d be able to love anybody. I didn’t think that marriage and love would happen to me. “Somebody even told me that I was used up goods and that no guy would ever love me.” But Miguel did and slowly Lily began to open up and finally agreed to marry him. The couple haven’t looked back since, and while -year-old Lily’s past will always be there, they are determined to look forward. It’s something she has done since her ordeal. Even trapped in that nightmare she imagined a new le and a new name – she was then Michelle Knight.  She chose Lily for her favourite flower, Rose for the mother of a childhood friend who cared for her and Lee, the middle name of her estranged son. I first met Lily in , a year after she and fellow Castro kidnap victims Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus – who had disappeared aged  and  – were freed. She testied at Castro’s  trial. He was sentenced to le plus , years but hanged himself in prison a month later. Lily had taken her first steps to a new independent le, flying for the first time and recording music. Now, she is just as funny, focused and fierce. She has added one more tattoo to the  she proudly showed back then. There’s a calm to Lily now, a sense of peace. Partly because, although she tells her story to help other survivors, she doesn’t look back.  She says: “I really don’t think about the past any more I’m moving forward. “Simply having the sheer joy of le. I’m able to sit outside and watch the sunrise, to be myself and not somebody I don’t want to be. “I did equine therapy and it helped me a lot. Animals can listen, they don’t judge you or make you feel bad for what happened.” Lily has created her own coping strategies. Painting and poetry to process her thoughts. Lighting candles and aromatherapy in her new home. Humming or pushing the wall when she’s feeling frustrated. She adds: “When I don’t want to hear something and want to calm myself down, I will plug my ears for  seconds. After that I’m fine.” Certain smells are triggers but she says: “I have to let myself know he’s no longer here. Nobody is going to fully get over what happened to them.  When she escaped, that new world was filled with people who didn’t always have her best interests at heart. Then Lily connected with Miguel through mutual friends on Facebook . She says: “We were both at a dficult time in our lives and needed someone who loved us for us. Not for our story, or what we went through.” But after six months of messaging and a few phone calls they still had not met, until Lily bumped into him at a ­restaurant. She knew he was someone special. Lily, who appeared on ITV’s This Morning with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in  to promote her book on the kidnap, adds: “I held back my ­feelings, I didn’t want to rush into things. The first time he told me I was beautul I didn’t believe him. When I was a child, I was told I was ugly.” A year and a half after their first messages, Miguel whisked Lily to Tennessee and proposed. She walked down the aisle on the third ­anniversary of her rescue.  Lily has faced death threats and had a stalker, things that have made her nervous to leave the house. But she says: “I also enjoy ­travelling. Maybe one day I won’t have to be afraid to go outside without somebody.” Her organisation Lily’s Ray of Hope helps those who have suffered domestic violence, human trafficking and abuse. Every year on the day she was rescued, she lights a candle “for the hopes of another family to have the same joy of their child coming home”. Through it all there is Miguel. They waited to marry before moving in together and now spend their time cooking and taking care of animals Lily rehabilitates for adoption. She says: “Now I’m a strong and powerful woman. “I always tell people, ‘I have my flaws, I have my fears, but I am not going to let them determine how I live my le. I’m a survivor.’”Visit lilysrayofhope.org"},{"url":null,"title":"woman trying sell iphone 200","story":"NewsWoman trying to sell iPhone for £ is offered adorable DOG in swap dealLeona Aspin was offered a dog when she tried to sell her iPhone  Plus onlineShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JUN NewsLeona Aspin tried to sell her iPhone online for £ \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman trying to sell her iPhone was stunned when she was offered a DOG in a swap deal.

The youngsters, who appear to be around five years old are seen stuffing items into a bag while two women distract staff, according to the store. Footage emerged on social media yesterday and is said to have happened the same day at Kenz Likkle general store in Coventry, also known as CY Penny. The CCTV footage was posted across social media captioned: “This happened today May  at kens shop on Broad park Road, Henley Green. Distraction while kids place items in a bag while adults distract the shopkeeper.” Another page posted: “Adults using kids in distraction shoplting.”    The video shows two women, a boy and two girls crammed into an aisle out of sight from the shopkeeper behind the till. One of the women leaves their bag on the shop floor before a boy in a yellow top stuffs what appears to be a large packet into the woman’s bag. The boy continues to hand pick specic items to put into the woman’s bag whilst the adults hover around the till. One of the women grabs an item from one of the girls who tried to put an item into the pram. She then shoves the little girl back to towards the boy and the bag.    Another girl is seen taking a step back and looks worried throughout the ordeal. The boy decides enough is enough and zips up the woman’s bag while they appear to pay for other goods. The boy is then stood waiting for the women whilst he struggles to hold the bag on his arms. A member of staff at a nearby convenience store today confirmed that the incident had happened at Kenz Likkle. The video shocked many people in the comments with most blaming the adults rather than the kids. Owner of the store, -year-old Karen Taylor, today said that the children were pushed into stealing £ worth of confectionery by their parents.    She said: They stole big bags of crisps and sweets that came to about £. The mother told her son to out the goods in the bag. To a see child being pushed into doing that is so wrong.

Smith has been locked up after being convicted of the aggravated manslaughter and abuse of a child in Pensacola, Florida. Her niece, Veronica Posey, , was jailed for le in March for first degree murder.    And a third member of the twisted family - Smith’s husband James,  - is already serving  years for his role in Derickaaposs death. An autopsy on the girl showed she had also been severely beaten on the day or days before she died in October, . Bruising found on Dericka’s bottom was described by the medical examiner as injury, on top of injury, on top of injury.” Smith, who admitted hitting her, rang Posey asking her to discipline Dericka for “acting up” with her eight-year-old sister.    Posey took a ruler and a thin pipe to give it “weight” and helped Grace Smith whip Dericka, said prosecutor Amy Shea. The girl was then forced to kneel down in front of an armchair and lean her body forward across the seat so her head was face down on the cushion. Posey then sat on Dericka’s back and she died because she could not breathe. Dericka was said to have screamed twice that she could not breathe and Posey rang  after getting up.Smith’s husband admitted later he did nothing to intervene and went on to plead guilty toaggravated manslaughter."},{"url":null,"title":"disneyland paris hiring princes princesses","story":"NewsDisneyland Paris is hiring princes and princesses - but there are strict rulesIf you think you would make the perfect Cinderella, Elsa or Belle, Disneyland Pariss new roles could be a great way to spend your summerShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAY NewsFancy working at Disneyland !\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDisneyland Paris is on the lookout for new princes and princesses to work at the park over the summer.

According to French influencer Louise Aubery, you have to be very careful what you post, as you can easily anger brands and companies you work with - and all it can take is one seemingly innocent photo.    Aubery, , posts online under the username @mybetter_self and has a whopping , followers.She often shares body positivity snaps on her account, posing in lingerie and encouraging people to love themselves.However she claims one recent photo, in which she was stood with a pal holding a sign reading all bodies are good bodies has caused some controversy.

The remains of two more elephants were found nearby, blood still pouring from where they had been blasted. And the majestic animals were killed in Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park – where they should be free to roam safely. A wildle investigator on a routine patrol stumbled across the harrowing sight, which is sadly all too familiar to him. “On a daily basis, we are losing prestigious God-given wildle to poachers,” says the officer who took the upsetting images. “The park loses wildle species nearly every day because of poaching. They want the ivory, leaving the body to waste away.    “Whenever I look at these images, I feel so sad. I love and value wildle. I’ve been doing conservation work for  years.” He remains anonymous to protect himself and his family, like many wildle wardens and investigators. Figures this week show elephant poaching is down to % from % – but experts warn their numbers are falling. Many wardens risk their lives by going undercover to snare poachers but there is often not enough evidence to nail them. So teams from the UK are now training investigators in wildle forensics to help boost convictions.    We joined TRACE Wildle Forensics Network, Traffic and their partners at the Netherlands Forensic Institute to see how they are helping. “Tackling the illegal wildle trade is an immediate need. We’re losing bioersity on a timescale shorter than climate change,” says Dr Rob Ogden, programme director at TRACE Wildle Forensics Network and head of conservation genetics at Edinburgh University. He is leading the course on the park’s outskirts and adds: “Wildle forensics is delivering the evidence to prosecute criminals but it must be available more widely and used more effectively.”  In two weeks,  senior investigators from the Departments of National Parks and Wildle in Zambia and Malawi, plus lab staff from the Victoria Falls Wildle Trust in Zimbabwe, learn how to take and preserve evidence. Dr Ogden, , says: “The forensics we do is dferent to traditional human forensics. Usually, with human crime, we know crime has been committed because somebody’s reported it, or somebody’s dead. We try to reconstruct what happened.  “In wildle forensics, you often know who’s involved as you’ll intercept somebody carrying something or someone selling something they shouldn’t be. But you need to prove whether a crime has been committed. So we use the analysis of wildle evidence. “We use scientic analysis because we can’t always identy things visually. To prove a crime has been committed, we need evidence to suggest whether it was a protected species or not.” During the course, funded by People’s Postcode Lottery, the European Commission and USAID, Dr Ogden and his team mock up crime scenes. The investigators are taught how DNA can be obtained from almost any biological sample and it is hoped the training will help them link evidence found at poaching scenes and that collected when suspects are caught or trophies are discovered.  Dr Ogden says: “The sample types with the most DNA, blood and tissue, also degrade quickest, so they are not always useful. Samples such as ivory or bone are harder to analyse but store DNA for years. Samples are sent to the lab for genetic analysis, starting with DNA extraction.” As they examine the fake crime scenes, one investigator tells me what he is up against. He says: “One night we heard a gunshot. It was total darkness and we couldn’t arrest them. They ran. At around am we found an elephant had died. “Those guys had tried to take the tusks off, they didn’t manage to. But the elephant was dead. There was nothing we could have done. What was the point  The elephant died for nothing.”  Poachers kill around , African elephants a year and there was a surge of ,% in rhino poaching in South Africa between  and . The global illegal wildle trade is worth an ­estimated £billion annually. This month, the presidents of Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia called for an end to a -year ban on ivory sales imposed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. And this week Botswana – home to the world’s largest elephant population, at , – said it would lt its ban on elephant hunting. Charles Mabethi, , was a wildle ranger for  years and is now a special prosecutor on game-related cases in Malawi. He once stepped in a gin trap during a patrol – a serrated metal animal trap hidden in long grass.  He says: “Poachers use gin traps. It’s a slow death. You can’t detect they’re there. The pain was indescribable. But this is a special job.” Mr Mabethi says despite stricter penalties on wildle crime since , prosecutors still struggle to get convictions. He says: “Poachers have caught on and because they are scared of the tough penalties, they lie and it becomes dficult to prove they committed a crime. “If we catch someone with bush meat, say an antelope, they will just say it is goat. “We have no way of proving they are lying. We don’t have the facilities, we have to send it to South Africa and that delays the case. By this point, they give bail and the poachers run away. It’s very frustrating. That is why this course is so vital. We hope it can be implemented in Malawi soon.” Mr Mabethi says another problem is in many cases, communities will support the poacher rather than the wildle rangers. He says: “They’ll come to the rangers with guns, axes, pistols. We are trying to change attitudes. It’s an ongoing process.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant orang utan pictured clinging final","story":"NewsPregnant orang-utan pictured clinging to final tree as bulldozers destroy rainforest around herShe is too weak and frightened to leave the trunk where she had sought sanctuary as machines tare down her ­jungle home in Borneo.ShareBySarah Arnold:,  MAY Updated:,  JUL NewsBoon-Mee holds on to trunk high above wreckage below \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA starving, heavily pregnant orang-utan clings to a solitary tree high above what had been pristine rainforest for ­millennia – till giant bulldozers moved in and flattened it in days. Boon-Mee was too weak and frightened to leave the trunk where she had sought sanctuary as the machines tore down her ­jungle home in Borneo, reports the Sunday People. That meant she could not forage for food – condemning herself and her unborn baby to an agonising death. Boon-Mee seemed doomed to share the fate of so many orang-utans in Indonesia, where palm-oil plantations are destroying the primates’ tropical habitats on Borneo and Sumatra. Hundreds of apes are slaughtered every year with guns and machetes in the drive for profits. But in fact Boon-Mee was lucky because in her case the plantation owners belong to a conservation group and told UK-based charity International Animal Rescue about her. An IAR team – backed by local forestry officials – was despatched and spent hours scrambling over fallen trees, often having to wear masks because stumps had been torched and were still smouldering. When they finally arrived at the scene, they found not just Boon-Mee but three other orang-utans.    Charanya had a baby and was desperately searching for food. Kalaya was semi-conscious and lactating, leading the team to think she’d just had a baby which had either died or had been taken as a pet. Meanwhile, Boon-Mee was surviving on bark. IAR official Lis Key said: “It’s heartbreaking to see the appalling state of these animals as their habitat is razed for the palm oil industry – they were weak from hunger. It’s a small comfort that this time rather than chase them off or kill them, the ­company did the right thing and ­contacted us.” Boon-Mee was the trickiest of the primates to catch because she was too weak to climb down from the tree. In the end, rescuers shot her with a tranquilliser and caught her in a net. The three adults and one infant were taken to a refuge, where Boon-Mee successfully had her baby. All the apes were nursed back to health and later released into the wild deep in another part of the forest. Lis said: “Despite the condition they were in, they really are the lucky ones. “The worst thing is there are hundreds of orang-utans who won’t be so lucky because of the awful conditions they are forced to try to survive in.”    Experts fear there are only , orang-utans left in the wild – a shocking , fewer than a decade ago. And IAR warn deforestation for palm oil is the No cause. The oil is used in up to half of all processed foods, is increasingly used as bio-fuel and is a key ingredient in items like shampoo and cosmetics. Lis said: “There are plenty of alternatives to it but none is as cheap”. And shoppers often don’t realise how widely it’s used because it can legally be ­tagged “vegetable oil” on product labels. But the EU plan to introduce new labelling rules next year.

Sometimes you don’t know until you know and today smacked me between the eyes that the strength of the squad wasn’t good enough.”McInnes could not afford a repeat last summer – nor can he afford the same during this transfer window.In the recent campaign Aberdeen finished fourth in the Premiership but secured European qualication.There was regression in the league but McInnes believes he successfully strengthened last summer only to be dogged by injury.He said: “With that first team of the season in the two ties against Burnley in the Europa League, we had everyone fit.“I thought we looked a proper team then. I thought to myself, this is the best squad we have had, but every time I went to pick a team after that there were about four or five out at any given time.”McInnes’ rebuilding job is already under way as Motherwell striker Curtis Main is expected to be confirmed as a Pittodrie addition next month, having agreed a two-year deal.Taylor has held talks and McInnes has also opened up dialogue with Ball in a bid to secure the versatile defender-midfielder on a permanent contract.Ball’s deal with Rotherham is set to expire and he will not be offered a new contract.McInnes also wants to secure Lowe on loan again next season, but will have to wait until late in the summer for Derby to make a decision on the left-back.Striker Wilson will also be a free agent as Manchester United have not taken up the option of the clause of an extra year in his contract.McInnes is keen to take Wilson to Pittodrie for next season, after he showed positive form in the post-split games.However, Wilson was reportedly on £, per week at Old Trafford and would have to take a massive reduction in wages at Aberdeen. It is understood Wilson is open to the possibility of a Pittodrie .McInnes had also been keen on securing attacker Stewart, but he looks set to join Rangers.McInnes said: “We’d like to get some signings in before we come back for pre-season and I’m pretty sure we will.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/5ce7ea0f81ca81.61891080.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet maisie lance and chopper are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Maisie is an energetic girl who will need an active owner to keep up with her.The Border Terrier Patterdale cross is very affectionate but is not suitable to be homed around young children and would need to be the only pet in the household.The five-and-a-half year old, who is neutered, is not good with other dogs and would need to be muzzled when out walking.Lance is a lovely boy and gets on with everyone he meets.There is no previous history on how he is around other animals or children, but he enjoys daily cuddles and snuggling up on a sofa.We have no previous history on how he is around other animals or children.Lance, who is around four years old, is a typical German Shepherd who likes to make himself heard.Staffie Chopper is a shy boy who would like a quiet home where he is the only pet and can get all the attention he deserves.Chopper, who is around nine and has been neutered, loves to play with his toys so will need a secure garden where he can run around and have fun.There is no previous history on how he is around other animals or children.Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThere will be no room to complainyou don#t speak up and give your opinions on how you see the front green looking.Clearly there will be a range of ideas, and it will be impossible to accommodate them all, but there will be no chance of seeing your vision realisedyou don#t speak to the design team.As ever, money for the project is limited and much of the cash will have to go on basics, such as improving drainage, but we join with councillors in encouraging our readers to drop in and see the initial designs on Colchester Square between am and pm tomorrow, Saturday March .Bringing back native species we humans killed off is a nice idea, in theory.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

That was the purpose of a meeting of farmers, teachers and others interested in the countryside on May .Organised for the Edinburgh-based charity by the local branch of NFU Scotland, -plus people came along to the Inveraray Inn on a bright, chilly May evening.Making the journey west to spread the word were RHET chairman George Lawrie and executive officer Katrina Barclay, who outlined the structure and potential benefits of RHET.With its headquarters at Ingliston, RHET acts as an umbrella body, co-ordinating the existing dozen Countryside Initiatives around Scotland . Each CI is set up as a charity in its own right, with help and support from Ingliston.The point of each regional CI is to bring children closer to farming, forestry, aquaculture and other rural industries.Working with partners, the charity would deliver learning opportunities for young people aged three to  around the Scottish agricultural environment and the countryside.Examples of the activities undertaken by RHET include farm visits for schools classroom speaker talks by volunteer farmers providing free educational resource materials for schools outdoor education events across Scotland competitions and projects for schools and training farmers and teachers in the delivery of information relating to food and farming.Regional CIs are supported by co-ordinators, who will liaise with schools and nurseries, organise visits, carry out health and safety checks and make sure everything is in place for events like farm visits.Present at the meeting was Argyll and Bute Council#s Head of Education Anne Paterson.#I am really encouraged to hear about the work of RHET,# said Mrs Paterson.Emphasising the the importance placed on outdoor education by the local authority, she added: #We have a good history of farm visits in Argyll and Bute, but on a more informal basis. As an education service we encourage schools to be outdoors.Mrs Paterson concluded: #We are really keen to make it happen and to work in partnership with RHET.#George Lawrie, who has been involved with RHET for around  years, said: #What I find most rewarding in working with the young people is just seeing the smiles on their faces.#If you want to find out more, whether as a farmer crofter, education provider or are involved in any other land use or rural industry, contact Lucy Sumsion by email at lucy.sumsion@nfus.org.uk to express an interest.PIC:From left: NFUS Argyll and the Islands region chairnman John Dickson with George Lawrie and Katrina Barclay of Royal Highland Education Trust. _aRHETmeetingKatrina Barclay addresses the sizeable audience in the Inveraray Inn as George Lawrie looks on. _aRHETmeeting"},{"url":null,"title":"fynefest celebrates turning 10 with a beer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFyneFest s for , celebrating hitting double figures with as much flair as ever.Beer, food and music: what more could anyone ask for  And there#s going to be plenty of each at this unique event, held over four days from Friday May .As usual, the field will be filled with trucks serving everything from pizza to curry and cupcakes.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the

develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had done enough to win the world title he so craved.There was no tense wait for the result to be announced ndash there was no doubt at all who the winner was going to be.And as the words ldquoand the

and it looks sure to be a close contest.But after handling an opponent of Baranchykrsquos calibre as capably as he did, Taylor will fear no one and be confident of adding Prograisrsquo WBA world

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9923486.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-airport-drama-as-plane-lands-just-two-seconds-after-another-takes-off","story":"The

higher chairs so instructors have a better viewof the trainee, the screens and theinteractions with the equipment.The rules state: ldquoA landing aircraft shall not be permitted to cross the beginning of the runway on its final approach until a preceding aircraft, departing from the same runway, is airborne.The report said there had been a \"loss of separation between the aircraft at a critical

,last year.:Edinburgh Airport posts further passenger growthThe Norwegian crew were told to maintain a speed of at least  knots on the approach, rather than a specic speed.As a result, the Boeing approached faster than normal.The report says: A combination of factors, including brief delays to the departure of the A and the speed of the Boeing  being higher than normal, led to the reduction in separation before the controllers became aware of the closeness of the aircraft.ldquoThe trainee controller lacked the experience to resolve the situation in a timely manner and the supervising On-The-Job Training Instructor judged it safer to let the  land than to initiate a go-around in proximity to the departing aircraft.\"The incident report stated the Norwegian pilots had seen the EasyJet aircraft and checked with air traffic controlwhen they were just under a mile from the runway whether they should abort the landing.It said: \"When they received an instruction to continue their approach, they interpreted this to mean that ATC were fully in control and they followed the instruction accordingly while continuing to monitor the situation.The report said the trainee controller heard the call made by the Norwegian plane over whether to \"go around\" rather than land, \"but did not hear what they said and so turned to the training instructor who advised to respond in the negative.The trainee controller transmitted \"negative\"and \"continue approach\"to the Norwegian flight crew.The AAIB said the training instructor became aware of the situation a few seconds before the time that Norwegian crew called.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ldquoSafety is absolutely paramount in our operations, a priority shared by ANS, and we have discussed this incident in depth with them.\"We are satisfied the remedial measures put in place are robust and continue to regard safety as the number one priority.A Norwegian spokesperson said: ldquoOur flight crews are

aircraft and as such the air navigation service provider has taken necessary steps to mitigate this event occurring again, at no time were Norwegianrsquos procedures questioned or the safety of our passengers compromised.An EasyJet spokesperson said: ldquoeasyJet is aware of the report and fully assisted the AAIB with its investigation.\"The safety of our passengers and crew is always

What was the thought process behind the event tonight Si: ldquoItrsquos been in demand for while, on Twitter and loads of people have been asking us about doing live shows, and the guy at the head of Tennents was really into Open Goal and he came up with the idea to do it in the Tennents Brewery, which was perfect for us for a place to do it and see how it went.Q: Tonight is the second one yoursquove done, can we expect more of them in the future ldquoYeah, itrsquoll be the same night again, just having a laugh, talking about football, Slaney being mental, big Kev telling it as it is and wersquove got James McFadden who wersquove interviewed before, really good talker, good laugh, he knows all the boys so should be fun, and good football chat and a good laugh.Q: Now letrsquos rewind a little bit. What made you start at Open Goal  What was the process when you first got approached what made you think it was the right move for you Si: ldquoIrsquove said before, I was working at the Royal Mail, coached at Celtic and played football but I hated working outside of football because itrsquos stuff I didnrsquot know. I delivered kitchens for a bit as well and hated it, and I was s****e at it. When I got a chance to maybe get a job within football again I jumped at it. Went and met the guys and they had a wee idea that I had never seen before so I thought why not.\"And as I have said loads of times as well, they thought big Charlie Mulgrew would be a bad interview because hersquos usually a terrible interview, so straight away I knew that Charlie was one of the funniest guys I know so people had that perception of him and I knew I could change that. Not me myself, but Charlie could change, and thatrsquos kinda whatrsquos happened.:Si Ferry talks football in our latest Cool Conversations\"Itrsquos mad how many people say their perception has changed on somebody after an interview, so, itrsquos went exactly as I planned.ldquoQ: How much planning goes into an episode of Open Goal, whatrsquos the planning process like Si: ldquoTherersquos loads, obviously you need to try and get guys to do it first, especially at first when no one really knew who we were. The whole team did really well getting people involved, and fair play to the guys they came on and they made it what it was because itrsquos very open and some of the stories that we heard have never been heard before and itrsquos that kind of format. Fair play to the guys that have come on, theyrsquore the one that has kindamade it what it is, and the people that have come on after that have followed suit.Q: Has the growing reputation helped get people on the show Si: Not really, no, I still need to ask people, I donrsquot think anyone really jumps at you to come and do an interview, you need to kind of graft and be a pest to get them on. Wersquove got good people behind the scenes who know a lot of people and a lot of good contacts, so thatrsquos helped as well. William Hill has been great as well they have sponsor days and make it part of the deal that they have to do an interview with us, so theyrsquove helped massively.Q: Yoursquore the face of it, the podcast and the channel, whatrsquos a typical day like for you when yoursquore filming Si: ldquoSo when I interview somebody, I usually try to find a couple of boys that have played with them and Irsquoll asktheyrsquove got any stories about them, what theyrsquore like, stuff like that, and then obviously go on the old internet and check out. The guy who writes all the questions does great with all them, so I kinda just look at the questions add wee bits here and there. And then when the guy comes in just try and make them feel as comfortable as possible straight away. Again, wersquove got a good team that do that with the people that come in and that helps them open up a bit.Q: And is it easier to interview people yoursquove played with that yoursquove grown up with A: At first it probably was, but the more Irsquove done it now, I quite enjoy doing people that I donrsquot really know. It gives me a wee challenge to try and get more out them. Anyone thatrsquos got good football stories is great for me.Q: Are you surprised at the success yoursquove had since starting this off Si: ldquoCourse I am. I know Scottish football, therersquos not one thing that everybody absolutely loves, some people love Sportscene, some people hate it, but ours so far, fingers crossed seems to have been quite well liked across the board, so I am very surprised but delighted obviously.Q: How did it feel to win at the Football Blogging Awards Si: ldquoIt was great, everyone that was there it seemed like it was the greatest day of their lives when they won, but we were just like, brilliant, went up and Slaney gave probably the funniest speech ever. Everyone went up and was thanking their mums and dads and that, and he goes up and starts singing Blurred Lines, and that just kinda shows you where we are at. Obviously, itrsquos great to win it but I prefer that people like it than winning awards.Q: How far do you think you can take Open Goal  Is it going to focus specically on Scottish football, are you going to get Tommy Gravesen in and focus on the English Premier League for a bit  Whats the next step Si: ldquoTommy Gravesen is the dream Obviously we done John Higgin, a couple of actors on, I think we can go anywhere. Obviously, our fanbase is mostly Scottish, but wersquove done Robbie Savage and he really enjoyed it sowe can break into doing English payers and that, definitely. Itrsquos open to all sorts.:Meet Scotlands game changersQ: With the success of The Terrace and their TV show is that something you could see going into in the future  Or are you wanting to keep the Youtube element and the podcast Si: Fair play to them, they got the TV spot, but I thinkyou look at our numbers, , downloads a week, and , on Youtube. Just now wersquove got a -year deal with William Hill so wersquoll keep going the way it is and whatever happens happens. Wersquore not going to put things saying wersquore going to do this or that, we want people to come to us andtheyrsquove got good ideas, wersquoll take it from there.Q: Obviously, Irsquom not going to ask you to pick your favourite guest, thatrsquos probably impossible, butyou could pick a -a-side team from all your interviews in the past, in their prime, who would you pick Si: ldquoYoursquod need to have McCoist upfront, wouldnrsquot you  Irsquod need to get Frank McAvennie in, they two upfront, for the night out after it. Wersquove only done one goalie, big Rab, Garry OrsquoConnor, yoursquod need to have him in, Gaz up and down the wing, -stone up and down the wing, and last one, Gordon Strachan, just to hear him shout at McCoist and McAvennie.

Despite its size, it is so light it can be balanced on a childrsquos index finger.Visitors to his Monmouth home in Wales are often intrigued by the wooden ornament. According to Mr McGruer, they are even more fascinated to learn how it has a very special place in world aviation history. For without it, that first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic, might not have taken off.The nished wood, he explains, is a replica of one of the Vickers Vimyrsquos wing struts. Its incredible lightness ndash a crucial factor in aiding the plane as it battled across those , miles ndash was made possible due to a remarkable invention patented by his Glasgow-born grandfather, Ewing McGruer, in .The eldest son of the well-known McGruer boatbuilding family, he was known for his innovative methods in yacht construction and design, particularly the use of spars in masts and booms for racing yachts.Mr McGruer said: ldquoBy carefully examining the end grain of a thin plank of sawn Sitka spruce, he found that where the angle of the grain was # to each side of the plank, it could be placed on a metal spindle, heated on one side and with water applied to the other the wooden fibres would contract and expand respectively. The thin wood could then be bent or rolled around the spindle. Waterproof glue would be applied to each edge and planed off.The ldquorolled hollow spar could be adapted to dferent degrees of strength using wooden tubes and laminated coils. And its discovery would help revolutionise all manner of items.A McGruer rolled hollow spar boom measuring ft long was fitted to King George Vrsquos royal yacht Britannia, while the War Office commissioned London-based McGruer Hollow Spar Company to churn out scores of wing struts for fighter and bomber biplanes deployed in France.Hollow spars arefound in wireless masts, organ pipes, walking sticks, billiard cues and even the rugby posts at Twickenham. In , George Malloryrsquos Everest expedition carried with them McGruer hollow spar ice pick handles.But it was the incredible Atlantic crossing that would see McGruerrsquos invention make aviation history.Alcock and Brown set off on June   from a makesht runway, their planersquos former bomb racks replaced with petrol tanks.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity dog walk to be held at haddo","story":"Employees of Nicol of Skene will be hosting a charity dog walk at Haddo Country Park in July.The event will be held on Sunday, July  at .am.The idea for the event was created through the love for dogs Nicol of Skene employees have and, their partnership with the cancer care charity, Friends of ANCHOR.The charity is one very close to many at Nicol of Skene.Richard Stott, Managing Director at Nicol of Skene, said: “Friends of ANCHOR are a very important charity in the North East of Scotland and unfortunately, many lives have been affected by cancer, our staff included. “The dog walk is a fantastic opportunity to have a great day out to raise money for a worthwhile cause.”Tickets for the charity dog walk cost £ per adult, £. per child and all dogs go free.The cost includes a sandwich, a bottle of water and all dogs participating will receive a free doggy goody bag.

The Charter lays out the unique approach, achievements and impacts of Fair Trade and illustrates how inclusive economic growth, fair wages and better working conditions can be achieved while empowering women and ensuring opportunities for the next generation.Aberdeenshire became the seventeenth Fairtrade Zone in , contributing to Scotland becoming a Fairtrade Nation.The area’s current Fairtrade Zone status continues until May , and one of the points in the Council’s Environment and Climate Change Policy states a commitment to develop an approach to ensure that local environmental, social and economic issues relating to the health and fair treatment of people are considered while also strengthening Aberdeenshire as a Fairtrade Zone.Following its decision last week, chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Sustainability Committee, Colin Pike, said: “Pledging support for the new International Fair Trade Charter further demonstrates Aberdeenshire Council’s commitment to the global Fair Trade movement.“We as a Sustainability Committee and as a Council fully endorse the aims and refreshed vision for Fair Trade in the ever-changing world we live in, and in line with our Environment and Climate Change Policy.” Vice chair, Isobel Davidson, added: “Aberdeenshire Council has been committed to the Fair Trade movement for a number of years now in ious capacities, and pledging our support for this new International Charter is a further demonstration of our continued advocacy going forward.”Aberdeenshire Council is also a member of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum . The Forum was established in January  to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland.The SFTF is encouraging other local authorities and public bodies to recognise the International Fair Trade Charter as a common reference document for the global Fair Trade movement.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Junior Doric Verse competitors\"  Society hosts Strichen Festival viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"glad rags and cartridge bags calling all prince charmings","story":"Scotlands premier all female shooting club, Glad Rags  Cartridge Bags is hoping to add a bit of romance to their event in June.It’s a first for the club as Mhairi Morriss owner of Jomm Events and founder of Glad Rags and Cartridge Bags explained: “I have so many wonderful ladies coming to our events, but some have not found their prince charming yet so I thought I would try and give cupid a helping hand by organising a fun evening of clay shooting and supper for all the single lads and lassies.”Mhairi stressed that it will be a fun relaxed evening with all abilities of shot very welcome from complete beginners to the more experienced.

After a decade of austerity, Scotland could be facing years more to come as balancing the books may require one of three options – higher taxes, cuts in spending or increased borrowing.Increasing taxes might seem like the politically sensible course for the SNP, who have been coming under attack from all sides over the state of public services like the NHS and education. However, the danger of higher taxation is that economic growth – already lacklustre at best – is damaged. According to the Scottish Fiscal Commission, growth is expected to be just . per cent this year – down . per cent on its previous estimate – and . per cent next year.: Scotland’s economy will be ‘plunged into peril by Brexit’, Nicola Sturgeon warnsOne of the best ways to increase the income tax take is to enact policies to boost the economy, create more jobs and, therefore, more taxpayers. However, this is obviously a much more dficult task than simply increasing the percentage the Government takes out of our wages and even a successful growth strategy will take time to produce results.The second option – of cuts to public services – is also problematic. If the Government reduces its spending, this can have negative consequences for the economy as a whole. And public anger over everything from GP waiting lists to unfixed potholes is such that the politicians who end up being blamed for any further pain could pay a heavy price.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said yesterday that it was “wrong to conclude that there are cuts to the Scottish budget when we have other economic levers”, suggesting he is considering the third option. Neither a lender nor a borrower be is a saying that is at odds with modern capitalism – most of us borrow money for all sorts of reasons – to buy a house, a car or even a fridge.But we are also aware that getting into too much debt can lead to catastrophe and the same is true for countries. How much debt is too much depends largely on the state of the economy – and not just the Scottish economy, but the global one as we all should have learned in . Some experts have warned a no-deal Brexit could be as bad the financial crash of that year so now may be a bad time to be getting into debt.

Mr Stedman-Bruce looked set to seize a seat north of the Border for Mr Farage’s party backing a ‘no-deal’ departure form the EU and it was primed for widespread gains.The SNP, which came out on top as expected with around  per cent of the early votes, saw Mr Smith and Mr Allard heading to Brussels as MEPs.Mr Smith said last night: “Scotland’s a dferent country. We’ve got a dferent view of how we see our place in the world.“We’ve got a dferent view about how we want to interact with our European continent.

The first seats declared on the night saw former Scottish Tory MSP Brian Monteith win a seat in the north-east of England for the Brexit Party, which took two seats in the region, while Labour took one seat. The Brexit Party’s  per cent share of the vote wasdouble the  per cent racked up by Labour.: Scottish Parliament’s Presiding officer on tour for anniversaryLabour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry blamed the lack of clarity about the party’s position on Brexit for its poor showing.“We went into the election where the most important issue was what was our view on leaving the European Union and we were not clear about it.“We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear and sent people out to campaign on that and unfortunately we just weren’t clear enough.”She said the party must now come out clearly in favour of a second vote on leaving the EU.The misery for the Tories continued just days after the announcement of Theresa May’sdeparture as leader, as the party was left heading for about  per cent of the vote. The omens were bad for the big two when the first results of the night came through in Leeds and saw Brexit claim victory with  per cent of the vote. Labour slumped to  per centwhile the Tory vote was down by  per cent. Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson tweeted a link to hisarticle, adding: “The message from last night’s results is clear.

Edinburgh recorded a . per cent turnout, an increase from . per cent in the  vote.It was a similar picture across the EU, where the traditional parties had a bad night, while the far right enjoyed a surge in support.

While football fans cheered Scotland’s qualication for the World Cup in Italy, at CERN in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee was sharpening his pencil. It would be a further year before the computer scientist’s idea for an information sharing system came to fruition and he would be mulling over whether to call it The Mine of Information, The Information Mesh or just the World Wide Web. However, back in , in a horseshoe-shaped building at Heriot-Watt University known as the Origo Centre, another idea was rapidly evolving. Years ahead of its time – and possibly unforeseen by the handful of staff working there – it would go on to stake a claim as one of the UK’s first fintech businesses and – perhaps most surprising of all –continue at the forefront of the rapidly evolving sector for the next three decades. This year marks the th anniversary of Origo, the fintech powerhouse behind countless financial transactions and a key component in ensuring the nation’s financial services sector can interact faster, with less fuss and more security to bring a fluid, seamless service to its professionals and their customers. What started with just three people brought together as the s drew to a close with a vision for a behind-the-scenes framework which would enable financial service providers to communicate electronically, has now ballooned in scale,and expertise.Today, Origo employs  fintech experts. Its initial innovation, Open Standards – devised to enable the financial services to securely operate using a common set of protocols, technical details and data – is now just one component in a suite of innovative products that raise efficiency and improve outcomes for a range of businesses, organisations, financial advisers and their clients. But it’s not every day you’re . So how does the nation’s original Fintech celebrate  According to Anthony Rafferty, Origo’s managing director, there is just one way for the business that laid the foundations of Scotland’s burgeoning fintech sector to mark the occasion – and that’s to work even harder. “Origo is going from strength to strength,” he says. “We are probably the UK’s and certainly Scotland’s longest-established fintech, but we are definitely not complacent.”The MD may be considered something of a new-start compared to ‘employee number one’, Laura Reed, who turned up for work as a personal assistant on that first day in  and remains with the firm three decades on as executive assistant, but he is far from a stranger to the business. Rafferty arrived in January  with a solid career behind him in financial service businesses – among them RBS, Bank of Scotland and latterly Aviva – that make every day use of Origo’s backroom technology to ensure smoother, smarter transactions. It was a bit like coming home for Rafferty – he was raised in Wester Hailes, a stone’s throw from that Heriot-Watt building where it all began. And it should be borne in mind that Origo was established a year before the first web browser was launched. Rafferty reflects: “Pension and le insurance companies must have been bemoaning the fact that doing stuff electronically was expensive and for the financial advisers they were interacting with, it was very inconsistent, because each company was doing it dferently.”Initially, four financial services businesses were on board with Origo. Two operators seconded from Standard Le and Norwich Union were charged with establishing common processes which would ensure that everyone involved spoke the same technical language, so issues such as getting quotes and sending data became so much more simple and secure. Before long the operation’s original name, Open Framework for Intermediary Services, was changed to Origo and its first portal – its ground-breaking Open Standards – was launched  months after. Flick the calendar forward dramatically and Origo is now based at Edinburgh Park and owned by  UK financial services shareholders – among them Aviva, Scottish Widows, Aegon, Prudential and Standard Le – whose priceless input ensures that its products are precisely what the industry needs and wants. The scale of Origo’s contribution to the financial services sector is impressive its fintech solutions provide secure access for eight-out-of-ten UK financial advisers to a wide range of financial businesses, enabling them to authenticate themselves instantly and carry out fuss-free, fast transactions on behalf of their clients. At the same time, Origo engages with a range of industry bodies, s, portals, software suppliers and government bodies to seek out ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Among its most signicant products is the Origo Transfer Service. Launched in , it has smoothed the passage of £ billion worth of pension and ISA transfers, providing a faster and safer system which benefits financial advisers, their clients and financial services business.At last count, the innovation was being used by almost  financial service companies. The transfer technology means that a transaction that might oncehave taken several weeks to carry out is cut to a few days and, in some cases, hours. Nevertheless, it is just one of a range of Origo services. And with  years behind it, Rafferty is clear on what the ‘magic formula’ is for the fintech’s success. “We have been quite canny in how we have done things,” he says. “Because we’re owned by  dferent financial service companies, we have access to the users of our services. “We have great focus groups with key users of potential services who help to influence development plans. We research things well with our customer base – we tend to get things right.”One example is the Origo Integration Hub. Designed for s and adviser software systems, users just plug in once to open up connections with every other hub party. It helps protect against risk, lowers costs and takes care of any operational or legislative changes.  In the spirit of constant evolution, Origo has now launched a new tracking element, so financial advisers can follow clients’ transfers online in real-time, eliminating the prospect of chasing for progress updates. “We stay very close to customers,” Rafferty adds. “Our second key ingredient is that our staff are world experts in fintech. That’s really important. “Thirdly, we are creative and flexible. We try stuff out and we are not afraid to fail. We check out ideas, but we don’t test stubbornly and continueit’s not working.”Launching soon is a highly-secure e-mail service, which Rafferty describes as a “game changer”. “It’s relatively easy for fraudsters to read someone’s e-mail as it goes over the internet,” he explains. “It’s no safer than sending a postcard with your bank details through the post, and even encrypted e-mails have problems. “We are launching Unipass Mailock for securing e-mails. Unipass is already well known –  per cent of financial advisers use it every day.”Unipass Mailock features world-class encryption so users can be confident their message is only read by intended recipients with an automatic read receipt as standard. It also removes the terror of an accidental ‘send’ users can recall an e-mail and remove all trace of it. Rafferty is full of praise for FinTech Scotland and Scottish Financial Enterprise’s efforts to nurture new businesses, support the more established and recognise their efforts. It’s a source of pride that Origo was among five businesses shortlisted for Scottish Financial Enterprise’s  Scottish Financial Services Award.And, of course, he is constantly looking forward – blockchain technology is just one area being scrutinised by Origo – keen to broaden the fintech’s horizons, perhaps to an international level.“I’d like to think that in  years’ time we’ll be celebrating  years of Origo all over the world,” he adds. “There’s huge potential to do what we do in other countries.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need EuropeIt wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May. This year Mid and East Antrim Borough Council are supporting a range of local iniduals sample market le, including local food producers, crafters and jewellery-makers.Ballymena: Seven Towers Leisure Centre car park, every Saturday from am to pmIf you would be interested in trading at any Mid and East Antrim Borough’s markets please contact-  Claire.duddy@midandeastantrim.gov.uk "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1848671.jpg--.jpg?1558509804000\n","title":"alec backing a very worthy cause by taking part in annual fun run of the glens event","story":"GLENRAVEL man Alec McQuillan is urging local people to take on the ‘Fun Run Of The Glens’ challenge.

My brother, Liam, was diagnosed with cancer back in  and had to have a kidney removed. “This was a very challenging time for him and the family. I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years. The event has now become established as a firm date in the cycling calendar for many cyclists and cycling clubs. “While we are well supported by other cycling clubs from right across Northern Ireland, we’d love even more people to join in.“The glens is a fantastic route, so much scenery to enjoy, and there’s a real feel-good factor and tremendous buzz. “The weather has also been very kind to us over the years. What better way to get fresh air, exercise, meet people and help an extremely worthy cause ”COURSEEntrants can choose the FROG cycle, either a mile, mile or  mile route, or FROG legs, a km or  mile run – there’s something for everyone.Participants who raise a minimum amount for Cancer Focus NI will receive a special commemorative top.

They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

She made clear at the beginning of the talks process however that she would not be providing a running commentary,\" the spokesperson said.\"It is an extremely sensitive and delicate time and the Secretary of State is focused on doing everything in her power to make a success of the talks process.\""},{"url":null,"title":"editors viewpoint election is over but brexit puzzle remains","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon why we should celebrate northern ireland having three female meps","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it comes to grasping at straws, that surely takes some beating.Its hard to argue that Alliance has bagged top boasting rights. Naomi Long more than doubled the Alliance vote, attracting , extra first preferences than Anna Lo did when she stood for the party back in , and the party has become the first to describe itself neither as unionist nor nationalist to take a European Parliament seat for the constituency.Some people will deny that last part. There are always conspiracy theorists on the farther edges of either political tradition who claim to know what Alliance \"really\" stands for.It also remains to be seen whether the results represent a permanent sht away from sectarian politics or just a recalibration of the centre. Another low turn out suggests voters here dont give EU elections that high a priority, even after three years of scare stories about the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The Remain vote only went up fractionally on the  referendum.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetWhats definitely historic is that the three MEPs sent to represent Northern Ireland in Brussels are all women, a detail which, to be honest, I hadnt even noticed until it was pointed out to me. That makes two things worth celebrating. The first is the increasing prominence of female representatives in a society which has been male-dominated for too long. The second is that their presence has become so familiar that its becoming possible to not even pay close attention to their gender.Some might wonder whether the female politicians in Northern Ireland are that much of an improvement on the men. The current impasse at Stormont has been presided over by the DUPs Arlene Foster, Sinn Feins Michelle ONeill and a female Secretary of State after all.That is to miss the point - and those who champion the entry of more women into politics often miss it most spectacularly.Alexandra De La Torre is coordinator of the womens peace project the Next Chapter. Last month she said that the real question to ask about the growing number of female politicians in Northern Ireland is: \"Are they representing all women  Or are they representing the male-oriented politics of their political parties \"With respect, that isnt the \"real\" question at all. Its not womens job to clean up the political sphere, any more than its their job to clean the house. It doesnt matterwomen make anything better. Women have every right to be as useless at politics as the men who came before them.What matters is that theyre there at all, which is why every woman who wins an election represents another small victory, not least in Northern Ireland, where, those totemic leadership roles aside, theyre still in a minority politically.There is something to be said for the argument that having female leaders masks the fact that women still dont have a strong enough voice, but part of the problem is the belief that women have \"a voice\" when the truth is they have lots of voices. Too often women in public le are told that they must say and believe certain things in order to earn respect, especially from other women who call themselves feminists, but whose feminism mainly seems to consist of telling other women what to think and haranguing them when they refuse. Feminists who still think the \"wrong\" sort of women are winning elections are just as guilty of doing down women as the misogynists who think the corridors of power are no place for a woman.Whats refreshing is that the three women who now speak for Northern Ireland at EU level are standing there on their own merits and on the s of their respective parties, rather than playing the \"female card\". They each see their role, rightly, as to represent everyone in Northern Ireland.That theyre all so dferent, in character and background and attitude, is noteworthy too. Diane Dodds was a teacher Naomi Long, an engineer Martina Anderson... well, lets just say she was out of the job market for a long time.When it comes to Brexit and the Union and other issues, their views span the whole spectrum of opinion. To give one example, Diane Dodds is opposed to any attempt to dilute the law on abortion Naomi Long believes that terminations should be decriminalised and made available in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality, but does not support extending the  Abortion Act fully to Northern Ireland Sinn Fein wants abortion liberalised immediately along the lines of the Republic. That seems broadly representative of views across Northern Ireland.There are other dferences too. Diane Dodds is from a rural background the other two grew up in the city, one in Belfast, one in Derry. Anderson is also the only one of the three to have blown up a furniture store in her teenage years, whilst Naomi Long found minor fame as a schoolgirl by appearing on the quiz show Blockbusters. Readers must decide for themselves which was the more admirable adolescent pastime.The important thing is that they are all distinct politically in ways that have little to do with their gender.As it happens, theyre unlikely to get a chance to take up their seats in the European Parliament anyway. The Tories have been so spooked by the rise of the Brexit Party that the new prime minister will feel bound to get the country out of the EU by the October  deadline rather than face another general election. All three seats were filled by women here for the first time, but it was probably also the last time. Just let no one say that the achievement is any less symbolic for that."},{"url":null,"title":"full recount ordered for ireland south european parliament constituency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On the left, the Labour Party characterises business as the real enemy. On the right, the argument for radical tax cuts, deregulation and smaller government is gaining ground, just as our population demographics are making them harder to do.“And as we look to rebuild the case for centre ground politics we should take a bold step in writing the next chapter in the story of statutory minimum wages in the UK. “A story which began under the Labour government of  – but which took a giant step forward under the Conservative government in  – so that we demonstrate once again that the well-regulated market delivers for all our people.”He said a gap had opened up in Britain and other developed countries between the “theory of how a market economy and free trade creates and distributes wealth and the reality experienced by many ordinary people”.“We ignore that gap at our peril becausewe do not address it, it will be filled with the reckless promises of the populists,” he warned. “But that doesn’t mean we should abandon our economic model.“So, for those like me who believe passionately that harnessing the power of market economics is the only way to deliver progress… it is imperative that we take decisive action to show that the regulated market model can deliver higher wages and higher living standards.”Mr Hammond earlier hinted that he would support a second referendumParliament cannot resolve Brexit. He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “If we do get to the point where Parliament does admit that it cannot resolve the situation, then it will have to be remitted back to the people.“I am not sure that a general election can resolve the question for the simple reason that both the main political parties are ided on the issues. This is a ision that runs not between the parties, but through the parties.“We need a period of calm now before contemplating the possibility of a general election.“My strong preference is for Parliament to resolve this butParliament can’t resolve it, then Parliament will have to decide how we remit it back to the people, whether it is in the form of a general election, or a referendum.”"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs fan jets off to madrid but finds plane is full of liverpool supporters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations. Tide is a co-production made for BBC Northern Ireland, BBC Alba, SC, TG and Sky Vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight at fishing retreat for ex veterans  ","story":"AN ex-army amputee who has opened a fishing retreat near Clough for disabled serviceveterans says his gamble has paid off.Robert Maxwell, who lost his right forearm and suffered severe head injuries in a serious road accident in , has been overwhelmed by support since the facility opened last week.Robert is the founder of the charity Letrsquos Do Veterans Support. Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me.

They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me.

As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees.

The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief. We are also grateful to our parents for their continued support and loyalty.The Bishopscourt playgroup will be taking part in a sponsored bag pack at the Asda supermarket in Downpatrick this Saturday between am and pm. Volunteers are welcome to get involved..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"There’s no way Lynch can lose  ","story":"DONARD, Commedagh, Bernagh, Binnian mdash everyone knowrsquos them, the higher peaks in the beautul mountain range that is the Mournes mdash a place that all who hail from south east Down are proud to call home.There are loads more minors peaks and hillocks in the  square miles that are great fun to explore and after decades of Hill  Dales the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo decided last winter that he would dream up a new route for one of the  series.First there was the venue mdash Meelmore Lodge. If you havenrsquot been to Meelmore Lodge lately, then go check it out. A signicant amount of investment has been done there and therersquos great parking facilities and easy access to the Ulster Way under the shadow of Meelmore .Therersquos accommodation there, including pods and plenty of camping spaces - great for a night out. The race exited the campsite with the organisers issuing strict instructions for runners not to cross walls or fences, except through an open gate where a marshal would be there to direct them.Wet tops were the order of the day, for while it was mild and dry, but there were a few ominous grey clouds around and once up near to , feet the climate conditions can be much more challenging.By the way, one of the race directorsdecided it would be wise to recce the course earlier in the week.So on Monday evening meeting at the above-mentioned stunning Meelmore Lodge, he gathered with a few so-called running mates. They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

He said that a single unionist party would merely gt , votes to Alliance. Yesterday Mr McGimpsey, who recently lost his Belfast council seat, was part of a BBC Talkback discussion on the matter, alongside me and Claire Sugden MLA.She put forward a plausible argument for the opposite to a single party, rather a liberal unionist one, saying that she wanted to register both her support for Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, while espousing liberal values such as same-sex marriage.For many years I was an advocate of such a liberal unionist option. In  I wrote an article about the utter failure of unionism to reflect the fact that many, perhaps most, unionist voters were irreligious. And even those voters who are practising Christians at least as likely to be moderately so as to be evangelical or fundamentalist.It has taken a long time for this to be accepted by unionist leaders. It first became apparent to me at a referendum in Castlereagh in  on whether to open leisure facilities in the borough on a Sunday.I was aged , left leaning politically and strongly opposed to Sabbatarians imposing their will on wider society. We all need guidance on ‘rights’ issues, particularly Christians Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Given that Castlereagh was then a DUP dominated council, and had a large number of Free Presbyterian residents, it would not have been surprising for the matter to have been narrowly decided. It wasn’t. It was a crushing defeat for the fundamentalists. I cannot find a web link to the exact result, but have a reasonably clear memory of it — something like , in favour of Sunday opening, and , opposed .At most, % of Ulster Protestants are Free Presbyterians .The DUP, understandably, has been reluctant to alienate a church that was one of its founding pillars. But its vote is now so large, and so much wider than that original base, that this has long been unavoidable.It is almost certain to continue to liberalise and it is no surprise that the high command accepted Alison Bennington, the recently elected gay councillor, as a DUP politician.It is, perhaps, self serving for some of its members to advocate an unequivocally liberal Ulster Unionist party, because they can then hope to be by far the biggest party .There is a risk that a liberal unionist party could descend quickly into confusion.Note how NI changed its mind on whether or not to designate as unionist. Or how Tina McKenzie, once a leading light of that party, later advocated joint authority — a relinquishing of UK sovereignty that even moderate unionists should view with contempt.In recent years massive threats to the Union have arisen, which liberal unionists have either endorsed or been mute about.The literary and cultural academic Professor John Foster Wilson, drawing on his experience of living in bilingual Canada, recently wrote on these pages about how an Irish language act would be a long-term threat to the Union.Meanwhile, the Brexit backstop, by in effect placing Northern Ireland on the Irish-EU side of the trade ide forever, will ultimately lead to a full border in the Irish Sea for goods and is a step towards limited joint authority.And it is at least arguable that the mooted structures for dealing with the legacy of the Troubles will, while attempting to improve the shameful status quo , nonetheless ultimately assist the IRA narrative on the past. Certainly Sinn Fein is so happy with the plan that it is demanding its implementation before it will allow Stormont to .If respected politicians such as Claire Sugden or Sylvia Hermon or John McCallister support all or some of those sorts of policies, then so be it. They can reasonably argue that such reforms ultimately secure the Union.But it is hard to see how such a worldview erges from that of the Alliance Party, except that it includes a specic endorsement on the Union .The Ulster Unionist Party did have a chance to develop a dferent sort of unionism in tandem with the Conservative Party a decade ago, but it abandoned that after  .If we were building parties for Northern Ireland from scratch, few people would choose the current set-up. But even a completely new party system would have similarities to the existing one. Given the ision on the constitutional question, there would be at least one unionist party and one nationalist party. There would also be a non-aligned, cross community party.Beyond that we would perhaps have a Green movement, a traditional Christian one and maybe a socialist or pro-business party.But we are not starting from scratch, and I am no longer sure a liberal unionist party makes much sense, particularlyit means repudiating key planks of what it means to be part of the UK.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"we all need guidance on rights issues particularly christians  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+ initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           We all need guidance on lsquorightsrsquo issues, particularly ChristiansNews Letter editorialPublished::Saturday  June Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Opinion\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Assembly will be held next week, one of the highlights of the church calendar.There will be much discussion, questioning, debate and decision-making at the annual event in Belfast.One interesting development to watch is that the assembly will receive a report on human rights, which seeks to establish a framework, based on Biblical principles, to assist Presbyterians respond to rights-based issues.Rights is a huge area of public and private le.The Equality Commission has released findings that  out of  people in Northern Ireland want to see equality, and want to see public figures taking a lead on the issue.It is no surprise that almost everybody will say that they are in favour of equality and human rights.But some groups seize on these terms in ways that alienate whole sections of the community.Some of the most shrill users of the phrase ‘human rights’ are apologists for terrorists who were the worst human rights abusers in western Europe since World War II.And equality did not mean much to Ashers bakery when it wanted not to have to bake a cake with a slogan it found upsetting, until the Supreme Court rule in their favour.This is an emerging and controversial subject area and we are all in need of guidance, particularly Christians, who increasingly fear that their own rights are being neglected.Optimism at talks yet key questions remain unanswered Coremetrics

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight. I respond to some and leave others until I’m at my office. amAfter I have listened to the news headlines on Radio  I get out of bed. First task is to let the dogs Arthur and Stella out. Then I’m like a cyclone raging around the house making sure two teenage boysare showered and dressed as we all have to be out of the house by am. amI force myself to get to the gym and twice a week, I train with my personal trainer Curtis. I prefer to get my sessions out of the way at the start of the day as I just couldn’t face the gym in the evening..amI normally start my day at our offices in Holywood with a quick meeting with our head of finance and head of production. Communication is crucial in television as schedules, filming and edits change constantly. Getting updates from my team helps me get into trouble-shooting mode.amI’m on the road a lot with work so it’s normally a flight to London or a drive to Dublin to meet broadcasters or talent. I can be down to Dublin twice a week for meetings. When I am driving I try to catch up on calls both work and personal and often have a lot of miscommunication with Siri.amUsually a coffee stop in an Applegreen and quick send of urgent emails. pmAfter meetings I’m straight into the car and back to the office for an afternoon of edit viewings and development meetings. I try to be healthy at lunch time but often I don’t have much time so I do keep a supply of protein bars in ious bags and drawers in my desk.pmWe have three or sometimes four edit suites running concurrently and as managing director of the company I like to review all our programmes before they are sent to commissioning editors. When the editors want to keep me happy they know to bring me a cup of Earl Grey tea. .pmResearch and development is the cornerstone of our company so daily catch ups are crucial with the team.  .pmI really need to unwind after a busy day and when I can I nip into a yoga class on my way home. I am truly terrible at yoga but I find it helps to just focus on myself for that hour. pmBack home it is checking home works and begging my elder son to revise for his A-levels. If I haven’t spoken to my daughter who is at university in Bristol, I will Facetime her. My husband tends to do the cooking during the week otherwise he knows he won’t get fed and although we eat healthy food there is often a glass of wine on the go.pmWe try to catch up on television shows that we need to be aware of across all the main channels.  pmThis is more indulgent time and my husband and I have a list of dramas that we stock pile, although I normally only last half an hour before falling asleep.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
